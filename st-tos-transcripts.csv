1,1,The Cage,bridge,Spock,,Check the circuit.
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Tyler,,"All operating, sir."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Spock,,"It can't be the screen then. Definitely something out there, Captain, headed this way."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Tyler,,It could be these meteorites.
1,1,The Cage,bridge,One,,"No, it's something else. There's still something out there."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Tyler,,"It's coming at the speed of light, collision course. The meteorite beam has not deflected it, Captain."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,One,,"Evasive manoeuvres, sir?"
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Pike,,Steady as we go.
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Garison,,"It's a radio wave, sir. We're passing through an old-style distress signal."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Pike,,They were keyed to cause interference and attract attention this way.
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Garison,,"A ship in trouble making a forced landing, sir. That's it. No other message."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Tyler,,I have a fix. It comes from the Talos star group.
1,1,The Cage,bridge,One,,We've no ships or Earth colonies that far out.
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Spock,,Their call letters check with a survey expedition. SS Columbia. It disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago.
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Tyler,,It would take that long for a radio beam to travel from there to here.
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Spock,,"Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar system similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class M, oxygen atmosphere."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,One,,"Then they could still be alive, even after eighteen years."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Pike,,If they survived the crash.
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Spock,,"We aren't going to go, to be certain?"
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Pike,,"Not without any indication of survivors, no. Continue to the Vega Colony and take care of our own sick and injured first. You have the helm. Maintain present course."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,One,,"Yes, sir."
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Narrator,,BOYCE [OC}: Boyce here.
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Pike,,"Drop by my cabin, Doctor. (Boyce enters with bag) What's that? I didn't say there's anything wrong with me."
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Boyce,,I understand we picked up a distress signal.
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Pike,,"That's right. Unless we get anything more positive on it, it seems to me the condition of our own crew takes precedent. I'd like to log the ship's doctor's opinion, too."
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Boyce,,"Oh, I concur with yours, definitely."
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Pike,,"Good. I'm glad you do, because we're going to stop first at the Vega Colony and replace anybody who needs hospitalisation and also. What the devil are you putting in there, ice?"
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Boyce,,Who wants a warm martini?
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Pike,,What makes you think I need one?
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Boyce,,"Sometimes a man'll tell his bartender things he'll never tell his doctor. What's been on your mind, Chris, the fight on Rigel Seven?"
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Pike,,"Shouldn't it be? My own yeoman and two others dead, seven injured."
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Boyce,,Was there anything you personally could have done to prevent it?
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Pike,,"Oh, I should have smelled trouble when I saw the swords and the armour. Instead of that, I let myself get trapped in that deserted fortress and attacked by one of their warriors."
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Boyce,,"Chris, you set standards for yourself no one could meet. You treat everyone on board like a human being except yourself, and now you're tired and you"
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Pike,,"You bet I'm tired. You bet. I'm tired of being responsible for two hundred and three lives. I'm tired of deciding which mission is too risky and which isn't, and who's going on the landing party and who doesn't, and who lives and who dies. Boy, I've had it, Phil."
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Boyce,,"To the point of finally taking my advice, a rest leave?"
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Pike,,To the point of considering resigning.
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Boyce,,And do what?
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Pike,,"Well, for one thing, go home. Nice little town with fifty miles of parkland around it. Remember I told you I had two horses, and we used to take some food and ride out all day."
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Boyce,,"Ah, that sounds exciting. Ride out with a picnic lunch every day."
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Pike,,I said that's one place I might go. I might go into business on Regulus or on the Orion colony.
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Boyce,,"You, an Orion trader, dealing in green animal women, slaves?"
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Pike,,The point is this isn't the only life available. There's a whole galaxy of things to choose from.
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Boyce,,"Not for you. A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets it head-on, and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away."
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Pike,,"Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender."
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Boyce,,Take your choice. We both get the same two kinds of customers. The living and the dying.
1,1,The Cage,pike's quarters,Spock,,"Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up message, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Garison,reads,"Eleven survivors from crash. Gravity and oxygen within limits. Food and water obtainable, but unless. The message faded at that point, sir."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Pike,,Address intercraft.
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Tyler,,System open.
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Pike,,"This is the captain. Our destination is the Talos star group. Our time warp, factor seven."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Tyler,,Course computed and on the screen.
1,1,The Cage,bridge,One,,"All decks have acknowledged, sir."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Pike,,Engage.
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Tyler,,"On course, sir."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,,Colt enters. Pike turns around and bumps into her,
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Pike,,Yeoman.
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Colt,,"Yes, sir."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Pike,,I thought I told you that when I'm on the bridge
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Colt,,"But you wanted the reports by oh five hundred. It's oh five hundred now, sir."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Pike,,"Oh, I see. Thank you."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,One,,"She's replacing your former yeoman, sir."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Pike,,"She does a good job, all right. It's just that I can't get used to having a woman on the bridge. No offence, Lieutenant. You're different, of course."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,,The Enterprise arrives at a planet,
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Tyler,,"We've settled into orbit, sir."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Geologist,,"Geological lab report complete, Captain."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Spock,,"Preliminary lab survey ready, sir."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Pike,,Spectography?
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Geologist,,"Our reading shows an oxygen nitrogen atmosphere, sir, heavy with inert elements but well within safety limits."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Pike,,Gravity?
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Geologist,,Zero point nine of Earth.
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Tyler,,"Captain? Reflections, sir, from the planet's surface. As I read it, they polarise out as rounded metal bits. Could be parts of a spaceship hull."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Pike,,Prep a landing party of six. You feel up to it?
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Spock,,"Yes, sir."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Tyler,,"Yes, sir."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,Pike,,"Sorry, Number One. With little information on this planet, we'll have to leave the ship's most experienced officer here covering us."
1,1,The Cage,bridge,One,,"Of course, sir."
1,1,The Cage,transporter room,Pike,,"There's no indication of problems down there, but let's not take chances."
1,1,The Cage,transporter room,Pitcairn,,"Yes, sir. There's a canyon to the left. We can set you there completely unobserved."
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,,the group explores until they find a rough settlement,
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Garison,,Sir.
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Old Man,,They're men. They're humans.
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Pike,,"Captain Christopher Pike, United Space Ship Enterprise."
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Haskins,,"Doctor Theodore Haskins, American Continent lnstitute."
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Survivor,,Is Earth all right?
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Pike,,"The same old Earth, and you'll see it very soon."
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Tyler,,And you won't believe how fast you can get back. Well the time barrier's been broken. Our new ships can
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,,He's struck dumb by the sight of a lovely young woman,
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Haskins,,This is Vina. Her parents are dead. She was born almost as we crashed.
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,,"The reunion is being watched on another screen, by three people with big bald heads",
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Pike,as the survivors pack up the settlement,Enterprise.
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,One,,"Landing party, come in."
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Pike,,We'll begin transporting the survivors and their effects up to you very shortly.
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,One,,"Quarters are being prepared, sir. Have I permission to send out scouting and scientific parties now?"
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Pike,,That's affirmative on the
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Vina,,"You appear to be healthy and intelligent, Captain. A prime specimen."
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,One,,"I didn't get that last message, Captain."
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Pike,,"Er, affirmative on request. Landing party out."
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Haskins,,"You must forgive her choice of words, Captain. She's lived her whole life with a collection of aging scientists."
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Boyce,,"If they can spare you a moment, I'd like to make my medical report."
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Vina,,I think it's time to show the Captain our secret.
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Boyce,,Their health is excellent. Almost too good.
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Haskins,,"There's a reason for our condition, but we've had some doubt if Earth is ready to learn the secret. Let the girl show you. We'll accept your judgment."
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,,Pike follows Vina up a slope to a ledge by a rock face,
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Vina,,"You're tired, but don't worry. You'll feel much better soon. Don't you see it? Here and here."
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Pike,,I don't understand.
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Vina,,You will. You're a perfect choice.
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,,"Vina vanishes, and so do all the survivors and their encampment. A door opens in the rock face, Pike is knocked out and taken inside. At the settlement -",
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Tyler,,Captain!
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,,Everyone rushes over in time to see the door closing in the rock. They fire their phasers at it but it just blasts away the rock covering to show the metal underneath.,
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Spock,,Spock here.
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,One,,"Landing party, come in."
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Spock,,"There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This is all some sort of trap. We've lost the Captain. Do you read?"
1,1,The Cage,pike's cage,,"Pike wakes to find himself in a cell with a transparent wall blocking his escape. He tests it's strength, and notices other similar occupied cells. There's a fanged ape, a giant bird and other scary shadows. The three aliens arrive",
1,1,The Cage,pike's cage,Pike,,"Can you hear me? My name is Christopher Pike, commander of the space vehicle Enterprise from a stellar group at the other end of this galaxy. Our intentions are peaceful. Can you understand me?"
1,1,The Cage,pike's cage,,"the aliens communicate with their minds, not voices",
1,1,The Cage,pike's cage,Talosian,,"It appears, Magistrate, that the intelligence of the specimen is shockingly limited."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cage,Magistrate,,"This is no surprise since his vessel was baited here so easily with a simulated message. As you can read in its thoughts, it is only now beginning to suspect that the survivors and encampment were a simple illusion we placed in their minds."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cage,Pike,,"You're not speaking, yet I can hear you."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cage,Magistrate,,You will note the confusion as it reads our thought transmissions.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cage,Pike,,"All right then, telepathy. You can read my mind. I can read yours. Now, unless you want my ship to consider capturing me an unfriendly act"
1,1,The Cage,pike's cage,Magistrate,,"You now see the primitive fear threat reaction. The specimen is about to boast of his strength, the weaponry of his vessel, and so on. Next, frustrated into a need to display physical prowess, the creature will throw himself against the transparency."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cage,Pike,,"If you were in here, wouldn't you test the strength of these walls, too? There's a way out of any cage, and I'll find it."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cage,Magistrate,,"Despite its frustration, the creature appears more adaptable than our specimens from other planets. We can soon begin the experiment."
1,1,The Cage,briefing room,Spock,,"The inhabitants of this planet must live deep underground, and probably manufacture food and other needs down there. Our tests indicate the planet surface, without considerably more vegetation or some animals, simply too barren to support life."
1,1,The Cage,briefing room,One,,"So we just thought we saw survivors there, Mister Spock."
1,1,The Cage,briefing room,Spock,,Exactly. An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's inhabitants.
1,1,The Cage,briefing room,Boyce,,"It was a perfect illusion. They had us seeing just what we wanted to see, human beings who'd survived with dignity and bravery, everything entirely logical, right down to the building of the camp, the tattered clothing, everything. Now let's be sure we understand the danger of this. The inhabitants of this planet can read our minds. They can create illusions out of a person's own thoughts, memories, and experiences, even out of a person's own desires. Illusions just as real and solid as this table top and just as impossible to ignore."
1,1,The Cage,briefing room,One,,Any estimate what they might want one of us for?
1,1,The Cage,briefing room,Spock,,"They may simply be studying the Captain, to find out how Earth people are put together. Or it could be something more."
1,1,The Cage,briefing room,Tyler,,"Then why aren't we doing anything? That entry may have stood up against hand lasers, but we can transmit the ship's power against it. Enough to blast half a continent."
1,1,The Cage,briefing room,Spock,,"Look. Brains three times the size of ours. If we start buzzing about down there, we're liable to find their mental power is so great they could reach out and swat this ship as though it were a fly."
1,1,The Cage,briefing room,Tyler,,"It's Captain Pike they've got. He needs help, and he probably needs it fast."
1,1,The Cage,briefing room,One,,Engineering deck will rig to transmit ship's power. We'll try blasting through that metal.
1,1,The Cage,talosian monitoring room,,As Pike continues to explore his cell,
1,1,The Cage,talosian monitoring room,Talosian,,"Thousands of us are already probing the creature's thoughts, Magistrate. We find excellent memory capacity."
1,1,The Cage,talosian monitoring room,Magistrate,,"I read most strongly a recent death struggle in which it fought to protect its life. We will begin with this, giving the specimen something more interesting to protect."
1,1,The Cage,rigel seven,Vina,,"Come on, we must hide ourselves. Come, come. Hurry. It's deserted. There'll be weapons and perhaps food."
1,1,The Cage,rigel seven,Pike,,This is Rigel Seven.
1,1,The Cage,rigel seven,Vina,,"Please, we must hide ourselves."
1,1,The Cage,rigel seven,Pike,,"I was in a cage, a cell, in some kind of a zoo. I must still be there."
1,1,The Cage,rigel seven,Vina,,Come on.
1,1,The Cage,rigel seven,Pike,,They've reached into my mind and taken the memory of somewhere I've been.
1,1,The Cage,rigel seven,Vina,,The killer!
1,1,The Cage,rigel seven,Pike,,It's starting just as it happened two weeks ago. Except for you.
1,1,The Cage,fortress,,The courtyard is scattered with lances and spears,
1,1,The Cage,fortress,Pike,,"Longer hair, different dress, but it is you, the one the survivors called Vina. Or rather the image of Vina. But why you again? Why didn't they create a different girl?"
1,1,The Cage,fortress,,The killer enters - a big humanoid with shield and axe,
1,1,The Cage,fortress,Vina,,Quick. If you attack while it's not looking.
1,1,The Cage,fortress,Pike,,But it's only a dream.
1,1,The Cage,fortress,Vina,,You have to kill him as you did here before.
1,1,The Cage,fortress,Pike,,You can tell my jailers I won't go along with it. I'm not an animal performing for its supper.
1,1,The Cage,fortress,Vina,,"It doesn't matter what you call this, you'll feel it. That's what matters. You'll feel every moment of whatever happens to you. Please, don't you know what he'll do to us?"
1,1,The Cage,fortress,,so Pike fights the killer with mace and shield,
1,1,The Cage,fortress,Pike,,Why would an illusion be frightened?
1,1,The Cage,fortress,Vina,,Because that's the way you imagined me.
1,1,The Cage,fortress,Pike,,Who are you? You act as if this were really you.
1,1,The Cage,fortress,Vina,,Careful.
1,1,The Cage,fortress,,Pike and Vina retreat up some stairs. The killer breaks Pike's spear and they throw objects at it. Pike gets knocked down into the courtyard. The killer grabs Vina and Pike throws a spear into it's back. Then it jumps down and spears itself on a wicked harpoon that Pike grabs just in time,
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Vina,,It's over.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,,"Vina hugs her hero, then sees the Talosians watching them. The Talosians leave.",
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,Why are you here?
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Vina,,To please you.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,Are you real?
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Vina,,As real as you wish.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,"No, no. No, that's not an answer. I've never met you before, never even imagined you."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Vina,,Perhaps they made me out of dreams you've forgotten.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,"What, and dress you in the same metal fabric they wear?"
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Vina,,"I have to wear something, don't I? I can wear whatever you wish, be anything you wish."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,"So they can see how their specimen performs? They want to see how I react, is that it?"
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Vina,,"Don't you have a dream, something you've always wanted very badly?"
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,"Or do they do more than just watch me? Do they feel with me, too?"
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Vina,,"You can have whatever dream you want. I can become anything, any woman you've ever imagined. You can have anything you want in the whole universe. Let me please you."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,"Yes. Yes, you can please me. You can tell me about them. Is there any way I can keep them from probing my mind, from using my thoughts against me? Does that frighten you? Does that mean there is a way?"
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Vina,,You're a fool.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,"Since you're not real, there's not much point in continuing this conversation, is there."
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,,A big laser cannon is aimed at the door in the rock,
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,One,,"All circuits engaged, Mister Spock."
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Spock,,"Standing by, Number One."
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,One,,Take cover.
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Spock,,"Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one."
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,,The laser cannon blasts away,
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,One,,Increase to full power! Can you give us any more?
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Spock,,Our circuits are beginning to heat. We'll have to cease power.
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,One,,Disengage. The top of that knoll should have been sheared off the first second.
1,1,The Cage,planet surface,Boyce,,"Maybe it was. It's what I tried to explain in the briefing room. Their power of illusion is so great, we can't be sure of anything we do, anything we see."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Vina,,"Perhaps if you asked me some questions, I could answer."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,How far can they control my mind?
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Vina,,"If I tell you, then will you pick some dream you've had and let me live it with you?"
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,Perhaps.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Vina,,They can't actually make you do anything you don't want to do.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,But they try to trick me with their illusions.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Vina,,"And, they can punish you when you're not co-operative. You'll find out about that."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,Did they ever live on the surface of this planet? Why did they go underground?
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Vina,,"War, thousands of centuries ago."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,That's why it's so barren up there?
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Narrator,,VINA; The planet's only now becoming able to support life again.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,So the Talosians who came underground found life limited here and they concentrated on developing their mental power.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Vina,,"But they found it's a trap. Like a narcotic. Because when dreams become more important than reality, you give up travel, building, creating. You even forget how to repair the machines left behind by your ancestors. You just sit, living and reliving other lives left behind in the thought record."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,Or sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Vina,,"You're better than a theatre to them. They create the illusion for you, they watch you react, feel your emotions. They have a whole collection of specimens, descendants of life brought back long ago from all over this part of the galaxy."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,Which means they had to have more than one of each animal.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Vina,,Please.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,They'll need a pair of humans too. Where do they get intend to get the Earth woman?
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Vina,,You said that if I answered questions
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,"But that was a bargain with something that didn't exist. You said you weren't real, remember?"
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Vina,,I'm a woman as real and as human as you are. We're like Adam and Eve. If we. Don't. Please don't punish me! (disappears)
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,,Pike sees the Magistrate walk away,
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,,Pike continues to search the walls for a door when a hatch opens and a glass is placed on the floor,
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Magistrate,,The vial contains a nourishing protein complex.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,Is the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals?
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Magistrate,,"If the form and the colour is not appealing, it can appear as any food you wish to visualise."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,And if I prefer
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Magistrate,,To starve? You overlook the unpleasant alternative of punishment.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,,"Pike is surrounded by fire and brimstone, screaming in pain",
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Magistrate,,From a fable you once heard in childhood. You will now consume the nourishment.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,"Why not just put irresistible hunger in my mind? Because you can't, can you? You do have limitations, don't you?"
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Magistrate,,"If you continue to disobey, from deeper in your mind, there are things even more unpleasant."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,,Pike drinks the nourishment then launches himself at the glass wall. The Magistrate steps back in surprise,
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,That's very interesting.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Magistrate,,Now to the female.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,You were startled. Weren't you reading my mind then?
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Magistrate,,"As you've conjectured, an Earth vessel did crash on our planet, but with only a single survivor."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,"No, let's stay on the first subject. All I wanted for that moment was to get my hands around your neck."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Magistrate,,We repaired the survivor's injuries and found the species interesting.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,Do primitive thoughts put up a block you can't read through?
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Magistrate,,It became necessary to attract a mate.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,"All right, all right, let's talk about the girl. You seem to be going out of your way to make her attractive, to make me feel protective."
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Magistrate,,This is necessary in order to perpetuate the species.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Pike,,It seems more important to you now that I begin to accept her and like her.
1,1,The Cage,pike's cell,Magistrate,,We wish our specimens to be happy in their new life.

1,1,The Cage,woodland glade,Pike,,"It's funny. It's about twenty four hours ago I was telling the ship's doctor how much I wanted something else not very different from what we have here. An escape from reality. Life with no frustrations. No responsibilities. Now that I have it, I understand the doctor's answer."

1,1,The Cage,woodland glade,Pike,,"Oh, no. I don't hate you. I can guess what it was like."
1,1,The Cage,woodland glade,Vina,,"But that's not enough. Don't you see? They read my thoughts, my feelings, my dreams of what would be a perfect man. That's why they picked you. I can't help but love you and they expect you to feel the same way."

2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Dehner,,"It is a fact that some people can sense future happenings, read the backs of playing cards and so on, but the esper capacity is always quite limited."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Spock,,"Severe damage. Seven crewmen dead. No, make that six. One crewman seemed to have recovered. That's when they became interested in extrasensory perception. More than interested, almost frantic about it. No, this must be garbled. I get something about destruct. I must have read it wrong. It sounded like the captain giving an order to destroy his own ship."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Kirk,,Comments?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Piper,,The only fact we have for sure is that the S.S. Valiant was destroyed.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Kirk,,"That's probably the best argument to continue the probe. Other vessels will be heading out here someday and they'll have to know what they'll be facing. We're leaving the galaxy, Mister Mitchell. Ahead, warp factor one."

2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's log, Star date 1312.9. Ship's condition, heading back on impulse power only. Main engines burned out. The ship's space warp ability gone. Earth bases which were only days away are now years in the distance. Our overriding question now is what destroyed the Valiant? They lived through the barrier, just as we have. What happened to them after that?"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Dehner,,"Autopsy report, sir. Each case showed damage to the body's neural circuit. An area of the brain was burned out."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Kirk,,"And you, are you feeling all right?"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Dehner,,"Yes. Mitchell, too, except for his eyes. We're trying to find a reason for that now, and why, out of our whole crew, only certain people were affected."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Spock,,"I think we've found that answer, Doctor."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Kirk,,You mentioned that tests show you have a high degree of extrasensory perception. So do the records of the others. Gary Mitchell has the highest esper rating of all.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Dehner,,lf you're suggesting there's anything dangerous
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Spock,,"Before the Valiant was destroyed, its captain was frantically searching for ESP information on his crew."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Dehner,,Espers are simply people with flashes of insight.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Spock,,"Are there not also those who seem to see through solid objects, cause fires to start spontaneously?"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Dehner,,There's nothing about it that could possibly make a person dangerous.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Spock,,Doctor Dehner is speaking of normal ESP power.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Dehner,,Perhaps you know of another kind?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Kirk,,"Do we know for sure, Doctor, that there isn't another kind?"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,without looking,"Hello, Jim. Hey, you look worried."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Kirk,,I've been worried about you ever since that night on Deneb IV.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,"Yeah, she was nova, that one. Not nearly as many after-effects this time, except for the eyes. They kind of stare back at me when I'm shaving."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Kirk,,Do you feel any different?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,"Well, in a way, I feel better than I've ever felt before in my life. Actually seems to have done me some good."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Kirk,,How?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,"Well, I'm getting a chance to read some of that longhair stuff you like. Hey man, I remember you back at the Academy. A stack of books with legs. The first thing I ever heard from an upperclassman was, watch out for Lieutenant Kirk. In his class, you either think or sink."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Kirk,,"I wasn't that bad, was I?"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,If I hadn't aimed that little blonde lab technician at you
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Kirk,,You what? You planned that?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,"Well, you wanted me to think, didn't you? I outlined her whole campaign for her."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Kirk,,I almost married her!
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,Better be good to me. I'm getting even better ideas here.

2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,"Hey, I'm trying to tell you I feel fine. When do I go back on duty?"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Kirk,,I'm going to ask Doctor Dehner to keep you under observation for a while.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,"With almost a hundred women on board, you can do better than that, friend Captain."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Kirk,,Consider it a challenge.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,That doesn't seem very friendly. (weird voice) Didn't I say you'd better be (normal) good to me?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Spock,,"He's reading even faster now than just a few moments ago. Is that Gary Mitchell, the one you used to know?"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Kirk,,Put a twenty four hour watch on the Sickbay. Fullest possible range of examinations and tests.

2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,"I've got nothing against you, Doctor."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Dehner,,Nor against the walking freezer unit?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,"Well, I, sorry about that."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Dehner,,Women professionals do tend to overcompensate. Now let's talk about you. How do you feel?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,"You know, everybody, everybody seems worried that I don't have some kind of fever or something. Maybe if we could just change these dials (sends them soaring). Now back to normal, I think."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Dehner,,How did you do that?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,"I'm not sure, I, I just thought of making it happen, and it does. It's, hey, er hey watch this, Doc."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,,"indicators plummet, Mitchell collapses",
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Dehner,,Stop it. Stop it! You were dead for almost twenty two seconds. There were no readings at all.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,"Yeah. Oh, boy. You, you know, Doc, there have been other things too, like going halfway through the ship's library in hardly a day. Yeah. Oh, what's happening to me?"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Dehner,,Do you remember everything you read that quickly?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,Yeah.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Dehner,,On any tape?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,Sure. Yeah.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Dehner,,Try this one.

2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Dehner,,Why?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,"That's one of the most passionate love sonnets of the past couple of centuries. How do you feel, Doctor?"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Dehner,,What?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,How do you feel?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Dehner,,I just fell. Nothing happened.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Narrator,,MITCHELL No? Are you sure? Are you sure?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Kelso,,"Er, I was on my coffee break. I thought I'd check up on"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Narrator,,"MITCHELL Yeah, that's okay Lee, come on in. Don't let the light in my eyes bother you, pal. It's all for our, our good-looking lady doctor here."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Kelso,,Yeah. Sure.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,"So, er, so, how go the repairs?"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Kelso,,"Well, the main engines are gone, unless we can find some way to re-energise them."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,You'd better check the starboard impulse packs. Those points have about decayed to lead.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Kelso,,"Oh, yeah, sure, Mitch."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,"I'm not joking, Lee! You activate those packs, and you'll blow the whole impulse deck."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Kelso,,"I'll, er, I'll get on it right away. I just wanted to stop by and make sure you were okay. See you later. (leaves)"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,He's a fool. A fool. He'd seen those points and he hadn't noticed their condition.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Dehner,,How do you know?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,The image of what he'd seen was still in his mind.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Kelso,,"Well, it didn't make any sense that he'd know, but naturally, I checked out the circuit anyway. I don't know how, but he was right. This point is burned out exactly the way he described it."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Dehner,,"Sorry I'm late. I became so interested in observing Gary, Mister Mitchell."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Spock,,"Our subject is not Gary Mitchell. Our concern is, rather, what he is mutating into."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Dehner,,"I know those from your planet aren't suppose to have feelings like we do, Mister Spock, but to talk that way about a man you've worked next to for years is worse than"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Kirk,,"That's enough, Doctor."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Dehner,,"I don't think so. I understand you least of all. Gary told me that you've been friends since he joined the service, that you asked for him aboard your first command."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Kirk,,"It is my duty, whether pleasant or unpleasant, to listen to the reports, observations, even speculations, on any subject that might affect the safety of this vessel, and it's my science officer's duty to see I'm provided with that. Go ahead, Mister Spock."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Spock,,Have you noted evidence of unusual powers?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Dehner,,"He can control certain autonomic reflexes. He reads very fast, retains more than most of us might consider usual."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Kirk,,"Mister Scott, would you repeat what you just told us?"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Scott,,"About an hour ago, the Bridge controls started going crazy. Levers shifting by themselves, buttons being pushed, instrument readings changing."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Spock,,"And on my monitor screen I could see Mitchell smiling each time it happened, as if this ship and crew were almost a toy for his amusement."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Kirk,,"Are they right, Doctor? Has he shown abilities of such magnitude?"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Dehner,,I saw some such indications.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Kirk,,And you didn't think it worth mentioning?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Dehner,,"No one's been hurt, have they? Don't you understand? A mutated superior man could also be a wonderful thing. The forerunner of a new and better kind of human being."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Kirk,,Mister Sulu.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Sulu,,"If you want the mathematics of this, Mitchell's ability is increasing geometrically. That is, like having a penny, doubling it every day. In a month, you'll be a millionaire."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Spock,,"In less time than that, he will have attained powers we can't understand and can't cope with. Soon we'll be not only useless to him, but actually an annoyance."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Kirk,,There'll be no discussion of this with the crew. Thank you. (everyone else leaves)
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Spock,,"We'll never reach an Earth base with him aboard, Jim. You heard the mathematics of it. In a month he'll have as much in common with us as we'd have with a ship full of white mice."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Kirk,,"I need a recommendation, Spock, not vague warnings."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Spock,,Recommendation one. There's a planet a few light days away from here. Delta Vega. It has a lithium cracking station. We may be able to adapt some of its power packs to our engines.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Kirk,,And if we can't? We'll be trapped in orbit there. We haven't enough power to blast back out.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Spock,,It is the only possible way to get Mitchell off this ship.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Kirk,,"If you mean strand Mitchell there, I won't do it. That station is fully automated. There's not a soul on the whole planet. Even the ore ships call only once every twenty years."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Spock,,Then you have one other choice. Kill Mitchell while you still can.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Kirk,,Get out of here.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Spock,,"It is your only other choice, assuming you make it while you still have time."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Kirk,,Will you try for one moment to feel? At least act like you've got a heart. We're talking about Gary.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Spock,,"The captain of the Valiant probably felt the same way, and he waited too long to make his decision. I think we've both guessed that."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Kirk,,Set course for Delta Vega.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,briefing room,Narrator,,"Star date 1313.1. We're now approaching Delta Vega. Course set for a standard orbit. This planet, completely uninhabited, is slightly smaller than Earth. Desolate, but rich in crystal and minerals. Kelso's task, transport down with a repair party, try to regenerate the main engines, save the ship. Our task, transport down a man I've known for fifteen years, and if we're successful, maroon him there."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,"I'm thirsty. (cup slides under tap, is filled, then flies through the air to his hand) It's like a man who has been blind all of his life, suddenly being given sight. Sometimes I feel there's nothing I couldn't do, in time. Some people think that makes me a monster, don't they Jim."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Kirk,,"Are you reading all our thoughts, Gary?"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,"I can sense mainly worry in you, Jim. Safety of your ship."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Kirk,,What would you do in my place?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,Probably just what Mister Spock is thinking now. Kill me while you can.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,,He zaps Kirk and Spock with electric bolts,
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Dehner,,"Stop it, Gary!"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,"I also know we're orbiting Delta Vega, Jim. I can't let you force me down there. I may not want to leave this ship, not yet. I may want another place. I'm not sure yet just what kind of a world I can use."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Dehner,,Use?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Mitchell,,"I don't understand it all yet, but if I keep growing, getting stronger, why, the things I could do, like, like maybe a god could do. (Kirk knocks him out)"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,sickbay,Kirk,,I want him unconscious for a while. (Dehner sedates him)
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,transporter room,Mitchell,,You fools! Soon I'll squash you like insects. (Piper re-sedates him)
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,transporter room,Kirk,,Energise.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Kirk,,"Can you do it, Lee?"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Kelso,,"Maybe, if we can bypass the fuel bins without blowing ourselves up."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Kirk,,Take him.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Dehner,,There's not a soul on this planet but us?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Kirk,,"Nobody but us chickens, Doctor."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega control room,Alden,,"I think I've got the 203-R set, Lee."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega control room,Kelso,,"Good, Alden. Transport it up with you, will you?"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega control room,Alden,,Okay.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega control room,Kirk,,"The fuel bins, Lee. Could they be detonated from here?"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega control room,Kelso,,A destruct switch? I guess I could wire one up right there.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega control room,Kirk,,Do it.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega control room,Spock,,He's regaining consciousness.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Kirk,,Doctor Piper. I want only one medical officer here at any one time. The other will monitor him on the dispensary screen.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Dehner,,"I'd like to stay now, try to talk to him."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Mitchell,,My friend James Kirk. remember those rodent things on Dimorus? The poisoned darts they threw? I took one meant for you.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Kirk,,And almost died. I remember.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Mitchell,,So why be afraid of me now?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Kirk,,"You've been testing your ability to take over the Enterprise. In the transporter room, you said something about us seeming like insects by comparison, squashing us if we got in your way."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Mitchell,,I was drugged then.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Kirk,,"Yes. In the Sickbay, you said if you were in my place, you'd kill a mutant like yourself."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Mitchell,,Why don't you kill me then? Mister Spock is right and you're a fool if you can't see it.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Dehner,,"You don't mean that, Gary."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Mitchell,,Man cannot survive if a race of true espers is born. In time you'll understand that. (tests the forcefield)
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Kirk,,"Gary. Gary, don't!"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Mitchell,,Jim.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Kirk,,His eyes went back to normal.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Spock,,"Fighting the force field drained his strength, for a while at least. He could be handled now."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Mitchell,,"I'll just keep getting stronger. You know that, don't you."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,bridge,Scott,having put new panel in a bridge station,"It fits like a glove, Captain."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega control room,Scott,,"Oh, did Mister Spock get the phaser rifle we sent down?"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega control room,Kirk,,I didn't order any (Spock enters with rifle) Affirmative. Landing party out.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega control room,Spock,,He tried to get through the force field again. His eyes changed back faster. He didn't become as weak.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega control room,Kirk,,Doctor Dehner feels he isn't that dangerous. What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega control room,Spock,,Because she feels. I don't. All I know is logic. In my opinion we'll be lucky if we can repair this ship and get away in time.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega control room,Kelso,,Direct to the power bins. From here you could blow up this whole valley.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega control room,Kirk,,"If Mitchell gets out, at your discretion, Lee, if sitting here, you think you're the last chance, I want you to hit that button."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega control room,Narrator,,"Captain's log, Star date 1313.3. Note commendations on Lieutenant Kelso and the engineering staff. In orbit above us, the engines of the Enterprise are almost fully regenerated. Balance of the landing party is being transported back up. Mitchell, whatever he's become, keeps changing, growing stronger by the minute."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Dehner,,He's been like that for hours now.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Kirk,,Have Doctor Piper meet us in the control room with Kelso. We'll all transport up together.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Spock,,If he should try to stop us
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Kirk,,Kelso will be on the destruct button until the last minute. I think he knows that.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Dehner,,I'm staying behind with him.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega control room,Kelso,,Fission chamber three checks out. The station seems to be running fine.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega control room,Scott,,"You're a talented thief, Kelso. Everything you sent up seems to be fitting in place."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega control room,Kelso,,I'm kind of proud of the job we've done. We're going to be ready to transport up (a cable loops over his neck from behind and throttles him)
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Kirk,,"You're leaving with the ship, Doctor."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Dehner,,He is not evil.
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Kirk,,"I gave you an order, Doctor."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Mitchell,,"You should have killed me while you could, James. Command and compassion is a fool's mixture. (zaps Kirk and Spock then waves away the forcefield. He leads Dehner into his cell and we see in the mirror her eyes are like his now)"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Piper,,"It hit me, too, whatever it was. Kelso is dead, strangled. At least Spock's alive."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Kirk,,Doctor Dehner?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Piper,,She went with Mitchell.

2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,delta vega brig,Piper,,"Yes, there was some morning light. They were headed across the valley, to the left of the pointed peaks. There's flatlands beyond."

2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Dehner,,What's wrong?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Mitchell,,"A visitor. A very foolish man. You'll enjoy being a god, Elizabeth. Blasphemy? No. Let there be food. Kaferian apples. Whenever we visited that planet, I always favoured these. Can you hear me, James? You cannot see me. I'm not there. You follow the right path, James. You'll come to me soon."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Dehner,,"I can see him in my mind, too."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Mitchell,,"Go to him, Elizabeth, talk to him. Now that you're changing I want you to see just how unimportant they are."

2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Kirk,,"At least partly, you are, or you wouldn't be here talking to me."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Dehner,,"Earth is really unimportant. Before long, we'll be where it would have taken mankind millions of years of learning to reach."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Kirk,,What will Mitchell learn in getting there? Will he know what to do with his power? Will he acquire the wisdom?

2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Dehner,,What do you know about gods?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Kirk,,"Then let's talk about humans, about our frailties. As powerful as he gets, he'll have all that inside him."

2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Kirk,,"You were a psychiatrist once. You know the ugly, savage things we all keep buried, that none of us dare expose. But he'll dare. Who's to stop him? He doesn't need to care. Be a psychiatrist for one minute longer. What do you see happening to him? What's your prognosis, Doctor?"

2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Mitchell,,"Morals are for men, not gods."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Kirk,,"A god, but still driven by human frailty. Do you like what you see?"
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Mitchell,,"Time to pray, Captain. Pray to me."
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Kirk,,To you? Not to both of you?
2,1,Where No Man Has Gone Before,planet surface,Mitchell,,Pray that you die easily.

3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"This is the United Earth ship Enterprise. We convey greetings and await your reply. What is it, Mister Bailey?"
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Bailey,,A message coming over my navigation beam.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,Pick it up.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Uhura,,"Switching, sir."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Balok,,"And trespassed into our star systems. This is Balok, Commander of the flagship Fesarius of the First Federation. Your vessel, obviously the product of a primitive and savage civilisation, having ignored a warning buoy and having then destroyed it, has demonstrated your intention is not peaceful. We are now considering the disposition of your ship and the life aboard."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,Ship to ship.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Uhura,,"Hailing frequencies open, sir."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,This is the Captain of the Enterprise speaking. The warning nature of your space buoy was unknown to us. Our vessel was blocked. When we attempted to disengage
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, we're being invaded by exceptionally strong sensor probes everywhere. Our electrical systems, our engines."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Balok,,"No further communication will be accepted. If there is the slightest hostile move, your vessel will be destroyed immediately."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,"They're shutting off some of our systems, Captain. Brilliant. Extremely sophisticated in their methods."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,Does the recorder marker have this on its tapes?
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,Enough to warn other Earth ships.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Bailey, dispatch recorder marker. Mister Bailey?"
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Bailey,,"Recorder marker dispatched, sir."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,Marker on course. Heading back the way we (big bang)
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Balok,,Your recorder marker has been destroyed. You have been examined. Your ship must be destroyed. We make assumption you have a deity or deities or some such beliefs which comfort you. We therefore grant you ten Earth time periods known as minutes to make preparations.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,Might be interesting to see what they look like if I can locate where that voice is coming from. (McCoy and Scott enter)
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Mccoy,,Balok's message. It was heard all over the ship.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"Captain to crew. Those of you who have served for long on this vessel have encountered alien lifeforms. You know the greatest danger facing us is ourselves, an irrational fear of the unknown. But there's no such thing as the unknown, only things temporarily hidden, temporarily not understood. In most cases we have found that intelligence capable of a civilisation is capable of understanding peaceful gestures. Surely a lifeform advanced enough for space travel is advanced enough to eventually understand our motives. All decks stand by. Captain out. Ship to ship."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Uhura,,"Hailing frequencies open, sir."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"This is the Captain of the USS Enterprise. We came seeking friendship but we have no wish to trespass. To demonstrate our goodwill, our vessel will now return the way it came. We (humming noise) Lay in a course ahead, Mister Bailey."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Bailey,,What? A course?
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Sulu,,"Plotted and laid in, sir."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"Engage, warp factor one."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Sulu,,Warp factor. There's no response.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,Switch to impulse.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Sulu,,"All engine systems show dead, and weapon systems."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,Switching to screen. I believe I can get something visual.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Balok,,You are wasting time and effort. There is no escape. You have eight Earth minutes left.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,I was curious to see how they appeared.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, of course you were."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Bailey,,I don't understand this. Spock's wasting time. Everybody else just sitting around. Somebody's got to do something.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Mccoy,,"Easy, Bailey."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Bailey,,What do they want from us? Let's find out what they want us to do.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,They want us to lose our heads.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Bailey,,We've only got eight minutes left.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Sulu,,Seven minutes and forty five seconds.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Bailey,,He's doing a countdown!
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Mccoy,,Practically end of watch.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Bailey,,"What, are you all out of your minds? End of watch? It's the end of everything. What are you, robots? Wound-up toy soldiers? Don't you know when you're dying? Watch and regulations and orders What do they mean?"
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"Bailey, you're relieved! Escort him to his quarters, Doctor."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Mccoy,,Let's go. (McCoy and Bailey leave)
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,Ship to ship.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Uhura,,"Hailing frequencies open, sir."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"This is the Captain of the Enterprise speaking. It is the custom of Earth people to try and avoid misunderstanding whenever possible. We destroyed your space buoy as a simple act of self-preservation. When we attempted to move away from it, it emitted radiation harmful to our species. If you've examined our ship and its tapes, you know this to be true. (humming noise)"
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Balok,,You now have seven minutes left.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Sulu,,"Four minutes, thirty seconds."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Scott,,"You have an annoying fascination for timepieces, Mister Sulu."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,Jim.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Balok,,Four minutes.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,What's the matter with them out there? They must know we mean them no harm.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,They're certainly aware by now that we're totally incapable of it.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"There must be something to do, something I've overlooked."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,"In chess, when one is outmatched, the game is over. Checkmate."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,Is that your best recommendation?
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,"I'm s, I regret that I can find no other logical alternative."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Mccoy,,"Assuming we get out of this, Captain"
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,Nobody's given up yet.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, then about Bailey. Let me enter it in my medical records as simple fatigue."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"That's my decision, Doctor."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Mccoy,,"And your mistake. You overworked him, pushed him, expected too much from him."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"I'm ordering you to drop it. I have no time for you, your theories, your quaint philosophies."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Mccoy,,I intend to challenge your actions in my records. I'll state that I warned you about Bailey's condition. Now that's no bluff.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"Any time you can bluff me, Doctor."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Balok,,Three minutes.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"All right, Doctor. Let's hope we have time to argue about it. Not chess, Mister Spock, poker. Do you know the game? Ship to ship."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Uhura,,"Hailing frequencies open, sir."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"This is the Captain of the Enterprise. Our respect for other lifeforms requires that we give you this warning. One critical item of information that has never been incorporated into the memory banks of any Earth ship. Since the early years of space exploration, Earth vessels have had incorporated into them a substance known as corbomite. It is a material and a device which prevents attack on us. If any destructive energy touches our vessel, a reverse reaction of equal strength is created, destroying"
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Balok,,You now have two minutes.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"Destroying the attacker! It may interest you to know that since the initial use of corbomite more than two of our centuries ago, no attacking vessel has survived the attempt. Death has little meaning to us. If it has none to you then attack us now. We grow annoyed at your foolishness."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,"However, it was well played. I regret not having learned more about this Balok. In some manner he was reminiscent of my father."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Scott,,Then may heaven have helped your mother.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,Quite the contrary. She considered herself a very fortunate Earth woman.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,Doc. Sorry.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Mccoy,,For having other things on your mind? My fault. I don't how the devil you keep from punching me in the face.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Sulu,,"One minute. I knew he would. (Bailey enters) If anyone's interested, thirty seconds."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Bailey,,"Request permission to return to post, sir."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,Permission granted.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Sulu,,"Eleven, ten seconds, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,"A very interesting game, this poker."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,It does have advantages over chess.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Mccoy,,Love to teach it to you.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Balok,,This is the Commander of the Fesarius.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,Here it comes. Is it raise or call?
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Balok,,The destruction of your vessel has been delayed. We will relent in your destruction only if we have proof of your corbomite device.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,Hold on that. Let him sweat for a change. Ship to ship.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Uhura,,"Hailing frequencies, sir."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,Request denied.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,"I have visual contact, Captain."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Balok,,"We will soon inform you of our decision regarding your vessel. And having permitted your primitive efforts to see my form, I trust it has pleased your curiosity. And now, another demonstration of our superiority."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Mccoy,,I thought the power was off in the galley.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Rand,,"I used a hand phaser, and zap. Hot coffee."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Sulu,,"Something's going on, Captain. (something leaves the Fesarius)"
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,It's a small ship.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,About two thousand metric tons.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Balok,,"It has been decided that I will conduct you to a planet of the First Federation which is capable of sustaining your lifeform. There you will disembark and be interned. Your ship will be destroyed, of course."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,"Engine systems coming on, Captain."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Balok,,Do not be deceived by the size of this pilot vessel. It has an equal potential to destroy your vessel.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,Tractor beam again.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Balok,,"So that you may sustain your gravity and atmosphere, your systems are now open. Escape is impossible since you are being taken under our power to your destination. Any move to escape or destroy this ship will result in the instant destruction of the Enterprise and everyone aboard."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Sulu,,"We're being towed, sir."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, star date 1514.1. The Enterprise is in tow. To this point, no resistance has been offered. My plan? A show of resignation. Balok's tractor beam has to be a heavy drain of power on his small ship. Question. Will he grow careless?"
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Bailey,,"Captain, he's pulling out a little ahead of us."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,He's sneaked power down a bit.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Sulu,,Our speed is down to point six four of light.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,I want a right angled course. Shear away from him no matter which way he turns.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Bailey,,"Yes, sir."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,Maximum acceleration when I give the word.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Sulu,,"Yes, sir."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,Engage.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Sulu,,"It's a strain, Captain. Engines are overloading."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,More power.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,"We're superheating. Intermix temperature, seven thousand four hundred degrees. Seven five, seven six, eight thousand degrees. (everything is juddering, the little ship is getting brighter and brighter)"
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"Shear away, Mister Bailey."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,"Two thousand degrees above maximum. Eight four, eight five, eight six. She'll blow soon!"
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"Now, Mister Sulu. Impulse power two."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Bailey,,"We're breaking free, sir."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,All engines stop.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Sulu,,"All engines stopped, sir."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Scott,,"Engines need work badly, Captain. Can you hold it here a few hours?"
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,That may not be wise. He got a signal through to the mother ship.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,Then we're not home yet.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Uhura,,"A signal, Captain. It's very weak. It's Balok. It's a distress signal to the Fesarius. His engines are out. His life-sustaining system isn't operating. The message is repeating, sir."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,Any reply?
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Uhura,,"Negative, sir. The signal is growing weak. Sir, I doubt if the mother ship could have heard it."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"Plot a course for it, Mister Bailey."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,"For it, Captain?"
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"Dead ahead. This is the Captain speaking. First Federation vessel is in distress. We're preparing to board it. There are lives at stake. By our standards, alien life but lives nevertheless. Captain out."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Bailey,,"Course plotted and laid in, sir."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Scott, ready the transporter room."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, sir. (leaves)"
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Sulu, bring us to within one hundred metres. Ahead slow."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Sulu,,"Ahead slow, sir."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Mccoy,,"Jim, don't you think"
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"What's the mission of this vessel, Doctor? To seek out and contact alien life, and an opportunity to demonstrate what our high-sounding words mean. Any questions? I'll take two men with me. Doctor McCoy to examine and treat the aliens if necessary, and you, Mister Bailey."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Bailey,,Sir?
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,The face of the unknown. I think I owe you a look at it.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Bailey,,"Yes, sir."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, request permission to"
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,bridge,Kirk,,"Denied. If I'm wrong, if it's a trap, I want you here."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,transporter room,Kirk,,Transporter ready?
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,transporter room,Scott,,"Well, yes, sir, but it's risky. We're locked on what appears to be a main deck."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,transporter room,Kirk,,Air sample?
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,transporter room,Scott,,"Breathable. In fact, a slightly higher oxygen content than our own. Communicator, phaser weapon."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,transporter room,Kirk,,"Thank you, Scotty. Ready, Doctor?"
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,transporter room,Mccoy,,"No, but you won't let that stop you."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,transporter room,Scott,,"Bend low, gentlemen. It reads pretty cramped over there. Ready to transport."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,transporter room,Kirk,,Energise.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,balok's ship,Kirk,,It's a dummy. A puppet of some kind.

3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,balok's ship,Kirk,,Commander Balok.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,balok's ship,Balok,,"I know, I know, a thousand questions. But first, the tranya. Gentlemen. (drinks) Ahh."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,balok's ship,Kirk,,"Commander, that puppet."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,balok's ship,Balok,,"My alter ego, so to speak. In your culture, he would be Mister Hyde to my Jekyll. You must admit he's effective. You would never have been frightened by me. And I thought my distress signal quite clever. It was a pleasure testing you."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,balok's ship,Bailey,,Testing us?
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,balok's ship,Kirk,,I see.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,balok's ship,Balok,,I had to discover your real intentions.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,balok's ship,Kirk,,But you probed our memory banks.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,balok's ship,Balok,,Your records could have been a deception on your part.
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,balok's ship,Mccoy,,And your crew?
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,balok's ship,Balok,,"I have no crew, Doctor. I run everything, this entire complex, from this small ship. But I miss company, conversation. Even an alien would be welcome. Perhaps one of your men for some period of time. An exchange of information, cultures."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,balok's ship,Kirk,,"Yes. Both our cultures would benefit. Do you know where we can find a volunteer, Mister Bailey?"
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,balok's ship,Bailey,,"Me, sir. I'd like to volunteer."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,balok's ship,Balok,,"Ah. You represent Earth's best, then."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,balok's ship,Bailey,,"No, sir, I'm not. I'll make plenty of mistakes."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,balok's ship,Kirk,,"But you'd find out more about us that way, and I'd get a better officer in return."
3,1,The Corbomite Maneuver,balok's ship,Balok,laughs,"I see. We think much alike, Captain, you and I. Now, before I bring back the Fesarius, let me show you my vessel. It is not often I have this pleasure. Yes, we're very much alike, Captain. Both proud of our ships."

4,1,Mudd's Women,transporter room,Kirk,,"Captain to transporter room. Are you reading me or not, Mister Scott? Bridge to transporter room. How many did we get off?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,transporter room,Scott,,"Oh, er, four in all, sir."
4,1,Mudd's Women,transporter room,Kirk,,"If that captain can walk, I want him in my cabin immediately. Correction,"
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,I want him there whether he can walk or not. Kirk out.
4,1,Mudd's Women,transporter room,Mudd,,"That fellow sounded a mite upset, didn't he?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,transporter room,Mccoy,,"Yes. Yes, they are."
4,1,Mudd's Women,transporter room,Spock,,"Curious. You're certain this was everyone aboard, Mister Walsh? No other crewmen?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,transporter room,Mudd,,"Oh, no, that's everyone, all right, but so far as the ladies actually being the crew"
4,1,Mudd's Women,transporter room,Spock,,You can explain that to the Captain. (the group leave)
4,1,Mudd's Women,transporter room,Mccoy,,"Amen to that, Scotty."

4,1,Mudd's Women,turbolift,Eve,,"I apologise for what he said, sir. He's used to buying and selling people."

4,1,Mudd's Women,captain's quarters,Kirk,,"And the ladies? Is this your crew, Captain?"

4,1,Mudd's Women,captain's quarters,Narrator,,"Captain's log, Stardate 1329.1. We've taken aboard from unregistered transport vessel its captain and, and three unusual females. These women have a mysterious magnetic effect on the male members of my crew, including myself. Explanation unknown at present."
4,1,Mudd's Women,captain's quarters,Mudd,,"Well, how the devil am I supposed to know this is a starship, Captain? Here I am with a cargo of young lovelies. A strange ship comes up alongside. Well. naturally I did my best to evade you. And starship Captain or no, you exceeded your authority when you drove me and mine into a shower of asteroids."
4,1,Mudd's Women,captain's quarters,Kirk,,"Your name, please."
4,1,Mudd's Women,captain's quarters,Mudd,,"Walsh. Leo Walsh. You destroyed me ship, Captain."
4,1,Mudd's Women,captain's quarters,Kirk,,"Mister Walsh, I'm convening a ship's hearing on your actions. Mister Spock will supply you with any legal information you may need for your defence."
4,1,Mudd's Women,captain's quarters,Mudd,,"You're a hard-nosed one, Captain."
4,1,Mudd's Women,captain's quarters,Kirk,,"And you're a liar, Mister Walsh. I think we both understand each other. Security! Escort Mister Walsh to his quarters. Confine him there."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Sulu,,"You're on duty, Johnny-o. Back to reality."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Farrell,,"You can feel their eyes when they look at you, like something grabbing hold of you. Did you notice that?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Sulu,,"I noticed. How I noticed. Come on, Johnny."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Scott,,"We've got trouble, Mister Spock."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Spock,,"I'm well aware of that, Mister Scott."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Scott,,"One lithium crystal left, and that with a hairline split at the base."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Spock,,Better rig a by-pass circuit.
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Scott,,Can't. We blew the whole converter assembly.
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,Kirk here.
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Spock,,"Needed on the bridge, Captain."
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Women,,Harry! Where were you?
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Mudd,,"Shh! Calm down now, darlings. Would you mind waiting outside?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Security,,"Sorry, sir."
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Mudd,,"Well, now, answer every question they put to you. Don't lie. Well, you've no need to, have you, and don't submit to a med. That is, being so healthy, they've no need for a medical exam, have they."
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Ruth,,What if they ask about
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Mudd,,They won't. Have you no place to go lads?
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Magda,,They'll notice we're different.
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Mudd,,"No, no, no, they won't. Just let Leo take all the hard questions. Now don't be panicking, loves. We'll get to"
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Eve,,"Get where? We don't have a ship and we're headed the wrong way, Harry."
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Nudd,,"Leo. Leo Walsh is me name, darling. Don't forget that. So lovely. Lovely, aren't they? If they only think lovely thoughts, if they smile, they'll come out right some which way, won't they? My personal guarantee on that."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Spock,,The entire ship's power is feeding through one lithium crystal.
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,"Well, switch to by-pass circuits."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Scott,,"We burned them all out when we super-heated. That jackass Walsh not only wrecked his vessel, but in saving his skin"
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,"If it makes you feel better, Engineer, that's one jackass we're going to see skinned."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Scott,,But it's frustrating. Almost a million gross tons of vessel depending on a hunk of crystal the size of my fist.
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Spock,,"And that crystal won't hold up, not pulling all our power through it."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,"Well, Mister Spock?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Spock,,"There's a lithium mining operation on Rigel 12. High-grade ore, I've heard."

4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Kirk,,"Mister Mudd, you're charged with galaxy travel without a flight plan, without an identification beam, and failure to answer a starship's signal, thus effecting a menace to navigation."
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Mudd,,What? My tiny ship in this immense galaxy a menace to navigation?
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Kirk,,You're also charged with operation of a vessel without a master's license.
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Mudd,,Untrue! I have a master's ticket.
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Computer,,Incorrect. Master's license revoked Stardate 1116.4.
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Mudd,,"All right. Well, very simply, Leo Walsh, who was to be my captain on this trip, passed away suddenly. Well, I had no choice but to take out me ship me own self. I assumed Leo's name out of courtesy to him. In memoriam, as it were. A fine, fine man, alas, gone to his reward."
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Kirk,,Destination and purpose of journey?

4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Kirk,,"Er, that's sufficient. Strike that from the record."
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Mudd,,"You see, gentlemen, just as I told you. Three lovely ladies destined for frontier planets to be the companions of lonely men, to supply that warmth of a human touch that's so desperately needed. A wife, a home, a family. Gentlemen, I look upon this work as a sacred public trust. I've devoted me whole life to it."
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Computer,,Incorrect.
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Mudd,,"Well, I'm about to start devoting my entire life to it."
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Kirk,,Did these ladies come voluntarily?
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Mudd,,"Well, of course! Now, for example, Ruthie here comes from a pelagic planet, sea ranchers. Magda there from the helium experimental station."
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Eve,,"It's the same story for all of us, Captain. No men. Mine was a farm planet with automated machines for company and two brothers to cook for, mend their clothes, canal mud a foot thick on their boots every time they walked in."
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Mudd,,"Fine, Evie. Fine."
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Eve,,"It's not fine! We've got men willing to be our husbands waiting for us, and you're taking us in the opposite direction! Staring at us Iike we were Saturnius harem girls or something."
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Mudd,,"That's enough, Evie."
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Kirk,,The only charges are against Mister Mudd. Illegal operation of a vessel. Do you have any defence to offer?
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Mudd,,"Only heaven's own truth, which I've just given you."
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Kirk,,The hearing is closed. Mister Mudd to be handed over to the legal authorities at our earliest opportunity.

4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Mudd,,"Oh, you beautiful galaxy! Oh, that heavenly universe! Well, girls, lithium miners. Don't you understand? Lonely, isolated, overworked, rich lithium miners! Girls, do you still want husbands, hmm? Evie, you won't be satisfied with a mere ship's captain. I'll get you a man who can buy you a whole planet. Maggie, you're going to be a countess. Ruth, I'll make you a duchess. And I, I'll be running this starship. Captain James Kirk, the next orders you're taking will be given by Harcourt Fenton Mudd!"
4,1,Mudd's Women,briefing room,Narrator,,"Captain's log-- Stardate 1330.1. Position, fourteen hours out of Rigel 12. We're on auxiliary impulse engines. Fuel low, barely sufficient to achieve orbit over the planet. Lithium replacements are now imperative. The effect of Mudd's women on my crew continues to grow, still totally unexplained. Harry Mudd is confined to his quarters under guard."
4,1,Mudd's Women,sickbay,Ruth,,May I come in?
4,1,Mudd's Women,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Why, yes, please do. By all means. Connors, are you finished?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,sickbay,Ruth,,I was wondering what this place looked like. It's fascinating.
4,1,Mudd's Women,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Would, Would you walk past my panel again, please?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,sickbay,Ruth,,Your what?
4,1,Mudd's Women,sickbay,Mccoy,,My medical scanner.
4,1,Mudd's Women,sickbay,Ruth,,"Oh, why? You're not giving me an examination, are you?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Oh no. I wouldn't trust my, my judgment, believe me. Just walk by, please. (scanner heart monitor activates) It's not supposed to do that."
4,1,Mudd's Women,sickbay,Ruth,,"I wondered, will you be examining the miners on Rigel 12?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Yes, if they need it."
4,1,Mudd's Women,sickbay,Ruth,,You haven't asked yet? Are they in good health and all?
4,1,Mudd's Women,sickbay,Mccoy,,"What? Oh, yes, they're in excellent health, all three of them."
4,1,Mudd's Women,sickbay,Ruth,,Oh. Three.
4,1,Mudd's Women,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Are you wearing some unusual kind of perfume or something radioactive, my dear?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,sickbay,Ruth,,No. I'm just me.
4,1,Mudd's Women,sickbay,Mccoy,,I wonder what makes it do that.
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Eve,,Captain? I hope you don't mind.
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"As a matter of fact, Miss McHuron, I do."
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Eve,,"I was trying to take a walk, and I just, I just had to run in someplace. You see, all your men were looking at me, following me with their eyes."
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Yes. I'll have to talk to them about that. They, er, they don't do that ordinarily, Miss McHuron, but somehow, in your case, and the ladies with you, its, er"
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Eve,,They're probably just lonely. I can understand loneliness.
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Yes. Yes, er, now, Miss McHuron"
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Eve,,"I, I suppose you understand it even more, having to run a huge ship like this with so much responsibility every minute and having to be so careful with all your men looking up to you."
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Well, it probably appears more difficult than it is."
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Eve,,Hmm! I read once that a commander has to act like a paragon of virtue. I never met a paragon.
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Neither have I.
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Eve,,"Well, of course not. No one is. But some people try to pretend. Do you, Captain?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Miss McHuron, I don't"
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Eve,,"Oh, no! Oh, I just can't do it. I don't care what Harry Mudd says. I do like you, but I just can't go through with it. I hate this whole thing!"
4,1,Mudd's Women,mudds's quarters,Mudd,,Just three? You're sure?
4,1,Mudd's Women,mudds's quarters,Ruth,,Yes. The miners are healthy and fairly young.
4,1,Mudd's Women,mudds's quarters,Mudd,,"Later, dear, later. Magda, did you get to your communications man?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,mudds's quarters,Magda,,The head miner is named Ben Childress. The others are Gossett and Benton.
4,1,Mudd's Women,mudds's quarters,Mudd,,And they've been there?
4,1,Mudd's Women,mudds's quarters,Ruth,,"Almost three years now, alone!"
4,1,Mudd's Women,mudds's quarters,Mudd,,"Perfect. Perfect. Three of them and three lovely ladies has Harry Mudd. And lithium crystals, my dear, are worth three hundred times their weight in diamonds, thousands of times their weight in gold."
4,1,Mudd's Women,mudds's quarters,Ruth,,"But they'll be down there, and we'll be up here, circling a hundred miles above them."
4,1,Mudd's Women,mudds's quarters,Magda,,"And there's a guard outside your door, Harry. You can't get out of your cabin."
4,1,Mudd's Women,mudds's quarters,Mudd,,"No, my dears. After one more job for you, it won't be Harry Mudd that's trapped. It will be a gentleman named James T"
4,1,Mudd's Women,mudds's quarters,Eve,,"I don't like you, and I'm not very happy with myself, either."
4,1,Mudd's Women,mudds's quarters,Mudd,,"Well, I'm not really surprised. I've seen you noticing the Captain."
4,1,Mudd's Women,mudds's quarters,Eve,,"We're supposed to notice them! Oh, oh Harry, I don't feel very good. I think it must be near the time."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,"I asked for a preorbital course, Mister Farrell."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Farrell,,"Preorbital course locked in, sir."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,"That's the last time I'm giving an order twice, gentlemen. We're down to battery power, and we're low on that."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Scott,,"It'll get us to Rigel 12, sir, but it'll be a shaky orbit."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,"Just hang us in long enough to get six crystals, Scotty. That's all we need."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Scott,,I'll get you there.
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,Ridiculous. What are we running here. Did you examine them? Did you examine Eve?
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Mccoy,,She refused.
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,"Well, come on, you're the doctor. What is it? Is it that we're tired, and they're beautiful? They are incredibly beautiful."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Mccoy,,"Are they, Jim? Are they actually more lovely, pound for pound, measurement for measurement, than any other women you've known? Or is it that they just, well, act beautiful. No. Strike that, strike that."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,What are they?
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Mccoy,,You mean are they alien illusions? That sort of thing?
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,I asked you first.
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Mccoy,,"No, an alien smart enough to pull this could also keep my medical scanner from going beep!"
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,I don't follow you.

4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Not at all, Mister Spock. The choice was burning this lithium crystal or the destruction of another man's ship. Come."

4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Kirk,laughs,Is there anything else?
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Childress,,"You've got no choice, Kirk. You beam a landing party down, and you won't find one blessed crystal."
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"No deal. You're a long way out in space, gentlemen. You'll need medical help, cargo runs, starship protection. You want to consider those facts too?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Mudd,,"Come along, ladies, come along. You must be Ben Childress. Come on now, girls, come on."
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Ruth,,And you must be Herm Gossett.
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Gossett,,"Yes, I reckon I am."
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Childress,,"One thing I'll say for you, Mudd, you're not a liar. Ladies, you are welcome."
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,It's still no deal.
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"Conserving batteries, sir. Half power."
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Mudd,,"I'm told they have only three days of orbit left before they start spiraling in. I do hate to see you suffering such a situation, Captain, but truth is truth, and the sad fact is you will deal. Sooner or later, you'll have to."
4,1,Mudd's Women,kirk's quarters,Narrator,,Captain's log. Transporting down to surface of planet Rigel 12 to acquire replacement lithium crystals. Expect further difficulty from miners.
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Kirk,,"All right, Childress, you've won. Now I'll take the lithium crystals."
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Childress,,"When I have the time, Kirk."
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Kirk,,Childress.
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Childress,,"We're busy, Mister Kirk."
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Spock,,"We don't have the time to spare, Captain."
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Kirk,,You got a better idea?
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Childress,to Eve,Blows like that all the time. You can get lost a dozen feet from your doorstep. The wind comes up sudden. Magnetic storm. That means the wind will really rip soon.
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Magda,,Dance with me.
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Childress,,Would you like to dance?
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Eve,,"No, I (coughs) No. I'm sorry, I guess it must be the dust."
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Childress,,That's the way it is on Rigel all the time. (cuts in on Ruth instead)
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Gossett,,Hey.
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Benton,,Go away.
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Gossett,,I'm cutting in.
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Benton,,Not on me. (fight starts)
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Childress,,What's the matter with you?
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Eve,,Why don't you run a raffle and the loser gets me? (leaves)
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Childress,,You can't go out there. You'll get killed.
4,1,Mudd's Women,miner's camp,Kirk,,Just have those crystals here when I get back.
4,1,Mudd's Women,planet surface,Kirk,,Eve! Eve!
4,1,Mudd's Women,planet surface,Narrator,,"Captain's log. Have transported aboard the Enterprise to implement search with infrared scanners and sensing system. Magnetic storms on the planet's surface are cutting down speed and efficiency of our equipment. Search now in progress for three hours, eighteen minutes."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Farrell,,Traverse parallel three and four.
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Sulu,,"Checking, but not getting much."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Spock,,"The storm is ionising the atmosphere, Captain. Getting difficult to probe through it."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Scott,,"Captain, this is draining our batteries further. If we only had those crystals."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,"But we don't! I didn't get any. I should have found a way. Satisfied, Mister Scott?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Uhura,,"Losing communications with the miners, sir. Magnetic storm seems worse."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,Has Childress reported in yet?
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Uhura,,"No, sir. He and the girl are still missing."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,"Sorry, Scotty. How much power do we have left?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Scott,,"About five hours, sir."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's log. Have expended all but forty three minutes of power. Ship's condition, critical. Search now in progress seven hours, thirty one minutes. Magnetic storms are easing."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Spock,,"Infrared reading. Check traverse three, grid zero four zero."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Farrell,,"About eleven miles, bearing one two one from the mining company."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Sulu,,That's Ben Childress' quarters.
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Spock,,There's a heat unit operating in there. It could be a cookstove.
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,Have Mudd meet me in the transporter room.
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Spock,,Mudd?
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,The name of this game.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Childress,,I had things where I wanted them.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Eve,,"I ate some of your food, so I paid with some chores."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Childress,,And I do my own cooking. I've not laid a hand on you. Remember that.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Eve,,"Oh, the sound of male ego. You travel halfway across the galaxy, and it's still the same song. There. You going to eat or talk?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Childress,,"I guess I'm supposed to sit, taste, and roll my eyes. Ooh, female cooking again. I've tasted better, by my own hand."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Eve,,Well you're tasting some of it now. I couldn't scrape three layers of your leavings out of that pan.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Childress,,"You find me a well, some decent water, then talk."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Eve,,"Well, why don't you hang your pan out in the wind and let the sand blast it clean, or hadn't you thought about that?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Childress,after hanging out the pots,It might work. That solitaire?
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Eve,,Double jack.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Childress,,The red eight ought to go on the black nine.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Eve,,Not in double jack.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Childress,,"You're not only plain as an old bucket, you're not even good company. What the devil happened to your looks, anyway?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Eve,,I got tired of you. I slumped.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Childress,,You heard what I said. You're homely! I've got enough in crystals already to buy queens by the gross! (Kirk and Mudd enter) I didn't touch her.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Mudd,,Thank heaven you found her.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Childress,,She's been bubbling with gratitude ever since.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Kirk,,"Sit down. Tell him. Tell him, Harry."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Mudd,,"Ah. Yes, well."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Kirk,,"The Venus drugs, Harry."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Childress,,"Venus drug? I've heard of it but, it's not just one of those stories?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Kirk,,"Oh, it exists, illegally."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Mudd,,"Well, actually, you see, it's a relatively harmless drug."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Eve,,Harmless!
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Mudd,,"Well, what it does is give you more of whatever you have. Well, with men, it makes them more muscular. Women, rounder. Men, more aggressive. Women, more feminine, and"
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Kirk,,He gave it to the women before you met them.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Childress,,Does that mean the others? They really look like she does?
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Mudd,,"Mister Childress, I"
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Childress,,Is that what it means?
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Eve,,"Yes, that's what it means!"
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Childress,,What happened to my partners?
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Kirk,,"They've left for their quarters during the storm, Childress. They're married. Subspace radio marriage. It was a fraud. They can get out of it."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Mudd,,If they want to.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Childress,,Why?
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Mudd,,You can't condemn the women.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Childress,,"I can! A man goes out and fights, almost dies. We all almost die. We should have, but we didn't. And now that we've got the good life in our hands, you bring us women for wives that"
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Eve,,"You don't want wives, you want this. This is what you want, Mister Childress. I hope you remember it and dream about it, because you can't have it. It's not real! (takes the pills) Is this the kind of wife you want, Ben? Not someone to help you, not a wife to cook and sew and cry and need, but this kind. Selfish, vain, useless. Is this what you really want? All right, then. Here it is."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Kirk,,"Quite a woman, eh, Childress?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Childress,,"A fake, pumped up by a drug."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Kirk,,By herself. She took no drug.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Eve,,I swallowed it.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Kirk,,Coloured gelatin.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Mudd,,"Yes, they took away my drug and substituted that."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Eve,,But that can't be.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Kirk,,There's only one kind of woman.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Mudd,,"Or man, for that matter."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Kirk,,"You either believe in yourself, or you don't. All right Childress, I've gone as far with you as I intend to. I want those lithium crystals and I want them now. Enterprise, this is Kirk."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Spock,,"Spock here, Captain."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Kirk,,Stand by. Do I beam down a search party?
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Childress,,"No, the crystals are here, and you're welcome to them."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Kirk,,"Stand by, Mister Spock. We're coming aboard with the lithium crystals."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Spock,,"How many coming, Captain?"
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Childress,,"Eve will stay, today at least. We, er, we want to talk."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Kirk,,Eve?
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Eve,,You've got someone up there called the Enterprise.
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Kirk,,"Two of us, Mister Spock. Come on, Mister Mudd."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Mudd,,"Don't you think you could possibly, by accident, arrange to leave me behind here? On this planet that would be punishment enough."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Kirk,,"I can't do that, Harry, but I will appear as a character witness at your trial. If you think that'll help."
4,1,Mudd's Women,childress' quarters,Mudd,,They'll throw away the key.
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Mccoy,,That must have been quite a talk you made down there. Ever try considering the patent medicine business?
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,Why should I work your side of the street?
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Spock,,I'm happy the affair is over. A most annoying emotional episode.
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Mccoy,,"Smack right in the old heart. Oh, I'm sorry. In your case, it would be about here."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Spock,,"The fact that my internal arrangement differs from yours, Doctor, pleases me no end."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Farrell,,Course plotted and all systems in operation.
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Sulu,,Engines engaged. Helm answering.
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Farrell,,"Out of orbit, sir."
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Kirk,,Ahead full.
4,1,Mudd's Women,bridge,Sulu,,"Ahead full, sir."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,planet surface,Kirk,,That should make a good specimen.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,planet surface,Sulu,holding pink animal with a horn,Temperature's starting to drop.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,planet surface,Kirk,,Yeah. At night it gets down to a hundred and twenty degrees below zero.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,planet surface,Sulu,,That's nippy.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,planet surface,Fisher,,Hey!
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,planet surface,Kirk,,What happened?
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,planet surface,Fisher,,"I fell off that bank, sir. Cut my hand."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,planet surface,Kirk,,Let's see it. Get back to the ship. Report to the Sickbay.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,planet surface,Fisher,,"Yes, sir. Geological Technician Fisher. Ready to beam up."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Scott,,Right. Locked onto you. Energise. Coadjutor engagement.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Wilson,,What happened?
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Fisher,,I took a flop.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Wilson,,Onto what?
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Fisher,,I don't know. Some kind of yellow ore.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Scott,,Magnetic. Decontaminate that uniform.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Fisher,,"Yes, sir. (;eaves)"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Scott,,That acted like a burnout.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Kirk,,Captain Kirk ready to beam up.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Scott,,"Just one moment, Captain. It checks out okay now. You better go get a synchronic meter so we can double-check."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Wilson,,Yes sir.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Scott,,"All right, Captain. Locked onto you. (Kirk stumbles as he leaves the platform) Are you all right, Captain?"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Kirk,,"Yes, I'm all right. Just a little dizzy."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Scott,,Let me give you a hand.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Kirk,,I can't get through there. Nothing serious. Don't leave the transporter room unattended.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Scott,,"Wilson will be right back, sir."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,,"both leave, and another Kirk materialises on the pad",
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, stardate 1672.1. Specimen-gathering mission on planet Alpha 177. Unknown to any of us during this time, a duplicate of me, some strange alter ego, had been created by the transporter malfunction."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Wilson,,"Captain? Are you all right, sir? Can I give you a hand, sir? Captain?"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,corridor,Uhura,,"Bridge to all decks. Section duty officers, check communication lines."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,corridor,Kirk,,Thank you.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,corridor,Scott,,It might profit you to let Doctor McCoy give you the once-over.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,corridor,Kirk,,"All right, Engineer, I'll have my engines looked to."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Rand,,"Ship's manifests, sir. I think they're in order now."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Thank you, Yeoman."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Rand,,I've checked
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,That's all.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Rand,,"Yes, sir. (leaves Kirk to lie down on bed)"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,"You picked a good day, Fisher. Business has been lousy. What'd you do, take a fall on purpose so you could get a little vacation?"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,Saurian brandy.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Narrator,,"Back to duty status, Fisher. I have no sympathy for clumsiness."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Fisher,,"No, sir. The hand's much better, sir. (leaves)"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,"What can I do for you, Jim?"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,grabbing him by the neck,"I said, give me the brandy! (leaves with bottle and goes to Rand's quarters)"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Yeah.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Spock,,Mister Spock.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Come in. Yes, Mister Spock, what is it?"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"Is there something I can do for you, Captain?"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Like what?
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"Well, Doctor McCoy seemed to think I should check on you."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"That's nice. Come on, Spock, I know that look. What is it?"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"Well, our good doctor said that you were acting like a wild man, demanded brandy."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Our good doctor's been putting you on again.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"Hmm. Well, in that case, if you'll excuse the intrusion Captain, I'll get back to my work."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,I'll tell him you were properly annoyed.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Spock,,Captain.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Kirk,,"What is it, Scotty?"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Scott,,"Transporter breakdown. Continue circuit testing. We beamed up this animal and, well, look for yourself. It's in this specimen case. (opens lid to reveal angry pink animal)"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Kirk,,Yes?
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Scott,,"A few seconds after they sent this one up through the transporter, that duplicate appeared. Except it's not a duplicate, it's an opposite. Two of the same animal, but different. One gentle, this. One mean and fierce, that. Some kind of savage, ferocious opposite. Captain, we don't dare send Mister Sulu and the landing party up. If this should happen to a man."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Kirk,,"Oh, my."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,rand's quarters,Rand,,"Oh! Captain, you startled me. Is there something that you? Can I help you, Captain?"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,rand's quarters,Kirk,,"Jim will do here, Janice."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,rand's quarters,Rand,,Oh.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,rand's quarters,Kirk,,"You're too beautiful to ignore. Too much woman. We've both been pretending too long. (grabs her) Stop pretending. Let's stop pretending. Come here, Janice. Don't fight me. Don't fight me, Janice. (kisses her)"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,rand's quarters,Rand,,Captain!
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,rand's quarters,Kirk,,"Just a minute, Janice. Just a minute! (forces her onto the floor, she scratches his face and gets away to the door which opens just as Fisher is passing by)"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,rand's quarters,Rand,,Call Mister Spock! Call Mister Spock!
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,corridor,Fisher,,"Geological Technician Fisher. Deck twelve, section (Kirk grabs him and hits him, hard)"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Me? My yeoman said that? I've been resting here since you left me. Alone, Mister Spock."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Spock,,Doctor McCoy reports that you demanded this brandy in Sickbay and left with it. I found this bottle in Yeoman Rand's quarters.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Not true. I haven't been to the Sickbay. Let's find out what's going on.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,turbolift,Kirk,,"Sickbay. (just missing the other Kirk nursing grazed knuckles, who goes into his quarters)"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Rand,,"Then he kissed me and he said that we, that he was the Captain and he could order me. I didn't know what to do. When you mentioned the feelings we'd been hiding, and you started talking about us."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,Us?
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Rand,,"Well, he is the captain. I couldn't just. You started hurting me. I had to fight you, and scratch your face."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,"Yeoman, look at me. Look at me, look at my face. Are there any scratches?"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Rand,,I was sure I scratched you. I was frightened. Maybe
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,Yeoman. I was in my room. It wasn't me.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Rand,,"Sir, Fisher saw you, too."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,Fisher saw?
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Rand,,If it hadn't been. I can understand. I don't want to get you into trouble. I wouldn't have even mentioned it!
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,It wasn't me!
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Fisher,,"It was you, sir."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,Do you know what you're saying?
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Fisher,,"Yes, I know what I'm saying."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Back to that bed, bucko. Come on, let's go."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Spock,,"You can go now, Yeoman. (Rand leaves) There's only one logical answer. We have an impostor aboard."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, stardate 1672.9. On the planet's surface, temperatures are beginning to drop, our landing party there in growing jeopardy. Due to the malfunction of the ship's transporter, an unexplained duplicate of myself definitely exists."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Kirk,,How did all this happen?
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Scott,,"I don't know sir, but when Fisher came up, his suit was covered with a soft yellow ore that had highly unusual properties. It may have caused an overload. Can't tell, not yet."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Kirk,,Does the transporter work at all?
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Scott,,"Yes sir, but we don't dare bring up the landing party. It might be duplicated like this animal."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Kirk,,How long will it take you to find the trouble?
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Scott,,"Can't say, sir."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Kirk,,We just can't leave those four men down there. It's getting dark. They'll die. The surface temperature of that planet goes down to a hundred and twenty degrees below zero at night.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Scott,,"We're doing everything we can, sir."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Kirk,,"Yes, I know, Scotty."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Spock,,"About your double, Captain."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Kirk,,"Yes, er, yes, we'll have to find him. Search parties, Mister Spock. Organise search parties."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Spock,,"We can't take a chance on killing it. We have no previous experience, no way of knowing what would happen to you."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Kirk,,"Yes, that's right. We don't know, but the men have to be armed. The men are to be armed, with their phasers locked, I repeat, locked, on setting number one. There can't be any chance of him being killed. He's to be taken without. If the men are forced to fire, he can't be killed."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Spock,,"How shall we explain it to them, Captain? The search parties are to capture you?"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Kirk,,Tell them.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Spock,,"The search parties, Captain."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Kirk,,"Yes, I'll make an announcement to the entire crew, tell them what happened. It's a good crew. They deserve to know."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Spock,,"Captain, no disrespect intended, but you must surely realise you can't announce the full truth to the crew. You're the Captain of this ship. You haven't the right to be vulnerable in the eyes of the crew. You can't afford the luxury of being anything less than perfect. If you do, they lose faith, and you lose command."

5,1,The Enemy WIthin,briefing room,Spock,,"Apparently, this double, however different in temperament, has your knowledge of the ship, its crew, its devices. This being the case, perhaps we can outguess him by determining his next move. Knowing how the ship is laid out, where would you go to elude a mass search?"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,briefing room,Kirk,,The lower levels. The Engineering deck.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,engineering,Spock,,"Set and locked on base cycle to stun, not to kill. What about your phaser, Captain? Don't you think we ought to get some help, Captain?"

5,1,The Enemy WIthin,engineering,Spock,,"Captain, you ordered me to tell you."

5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,"He'll be regaining consciousness soon, and not knowing what his physical state is, I don't think I dare give him a tranquilizer of any kind. I think we'd better bind him."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,"Yes. yes, all right. What's the matter with me?"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Spock,,"Judging from my observations, Captain, you're rapidly losing the power of decision."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,"You have a point, Spock?"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Spock,,"Yes, always, Doctor. We have here an unusual opportunity to appraise the human mind, or to examine, in Earth terms, the roles of good and evil in a man. His negative side, which you call hostility, lust, violence, and his positive side, which Earth people express as compassion, love, tenderness."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,"It's the Captain's guts you're analysing. Are you of that, Spock?"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Spock,,"Yes, and what is it that makes one man an exceptional leader? We see indications that it's his negative side which makes him strong, that his evil side, if you will, properly controlled and disciplined, is vital to his strength. Your negative side removed from you, the power of command begins to elude you."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,"What is your point, Mister Spock?"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Spock,,"If your power of command continues to weaken, you'll soon be unable to function as Captain. You must be prepared for that."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,"You have your intellect, Jim. You can fight with that!"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,For how long?
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Spock,,"If I seem insensitive to what you're going through, Captain, understand it's the way I am."

5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,What happened?
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,Apparently the body functioning weakened during the duplication process. A fact I failed to consider.

5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Other Kirk,,Help me.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,How can he die? Can I survive without him?
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I don't know, Jim."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,Don't be afraid. Here's my hand. Hold on. You don't have to be afraid. I won't let go. Hold on. You won't be afraid if you use your mind and think! Think! You can do it. That's it!
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Jim, he is back! Jim, you can use that brandy now. In fact, I'll join you."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,"I have to take him back inside myself. I can't survive without him. I don't want him back. He's like an animal, a thoughtless, brutal animal, and yet it's me. Me."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Jim, you're no different than anyone else. We all have our darker side. We need it! It's half of what we are. It's not really ugly, it's human."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,Human.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Yes, human. A lot of what he is makes you the man you are. God forbid I should have to agree with Spock, but he was right. Without the negative side, you wouldn't be the Captain. You couldn't be, and you know it. Your strength of command lies mostly in him."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,What do I have?
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,You have the goodness.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,Not enough. I have a ship to command.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,"The intelligence, the logic. It appears your half has most of that, and perhaps that's where man's essential courage comes from. For you see, he was afraid and you weren't."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Spock,,Captain Kirk.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,Kirk here.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Spock,,Spock here. Would you come to the transporter room. We think we may have found an answer.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,Coming.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Kirk,,What is it?
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Scott,,"We've found a way to get the transporter working, sir."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Spock,,"We've attached some bypass and leader circuits to compensate for the difference. Tied directly into the impulse engines, there shouldn't be more than a five point variation in the velocity balance. I suggest we send the animal through. Captain."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Kirk,,"Yes, yes. Go ahead."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Scott,opening box with angry animal in it,I'll grab him by the scruff of the neck and hold him as long as I can.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Kirk,,Don't hurt him.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Spock,,It's painless and quick. The animal will be unconscious for only a few minutes. (sedates it)

5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Spock,,Energise. Reverse.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Spock,,The shock of putting him back together seems to have been too much for him.

5,1,The Enemy WIthin,transporter room,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, stardate 1673.1. Entry made by Second Officer Spock. Captain Kirk retains command of this vessel, but his force of will rapidly fading. Condition of landing party critical. Transporter unit still under repair."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,Autopsy in-depth. Hurry. I don't know. Animal could have died of some kind of shock.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Spock,,"For once, I agree with you."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I said could have, Mister Spock. We won't know until we get a full post-mortem."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Spock,,"No autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified, confused. It was split into two halves and suddenly thrust back together again. Thus shock induced by blind terror."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,"Yes, yes, that sounds likely."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Spock,,It couldn't understand. You can. You have your intelligence controlling your fear.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,Get the transporter room ready.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Could be, if, maybe. All guesswork so far. Just theory. Jim, why don't you give me a chance to do an autopsy and let Spock check the transporter circuits again."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,"That sounds, sounds reasonable. We should double-check everything."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Spock,,"Aren't you forgetting something, Captain?"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,"No, I don't think I've for"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Spock,,Your men on the planet surface. How much time do they have left?
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,"Yes, that's right. The men. We have to take the chance, Bones. Their lives"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Suppose it wasn't shock, Jim. Suppose death was caused by transporter malfunction. Then you'd die. They'd die, anyway. Jim, you can't risk your life on a theory!"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Spock,,"Being split in two halves is no theory with me, Doctor. I have a human half, you see, as well as an alien half, submerged, constantly at war with each other. Personal experience, Doctor. I survive it because my intelligence wins over both, makes them live together. Your intelligence would enable you to survive as well."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,Help me. Somebody make the decision.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Spock,,"Are you relinquishing your command, Captain?"
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,"No. No, I'm not."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well then, we can't help you, Jim. The decision is yours."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, ready the transporter room. Bones, continue the autopsy."

5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Other Kirk,,There's nothing I can do to stop you.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,sickbay,Kirk,,It's what I have to do. It's what I have to do. What we have to do.

5,1,The Enemy WIthin,corridor,Rand,,No.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,corridor,Kirk,,"Yes, I do. The transporter malfunctioned, divided me, created a duplicate. The animal part of me came to your cabin. He even scratched me to make us look more alike. I'd like the chance to explain it to you. You don't mind if I come to your cabin later?"

5,1,The Enemy WIthin,bridge,Mccoy,,He (the one in the captain's chair) attacked him.

5,1,The Enemy WIthin,bridge,Spock,,We'll let the captain handle this.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,bridge,Other Kirk,,I'm the captain. Isn't that obvious? Look at his face. Remember the scratches? Look how he's tried to hide them. He wants you to think that he's Captain Kirk. You know who I am.
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, I know."
5,1,The Enemy WIthin,bridge,Other Kirk,,"You want to kill me, don't you? Farrell, James, grab him. He'll destroy the ship! I'm the Captain. Don't you understand? I'm captain of the ship! (starts attacking the crew) I'm the captain! This is my ship! My ship! It's mine! I'll kill you."

Now will you please go back where you came from and tell whoever issues your orders to leave me and my wife alone. We need salt against the heat. Aside from that, we're doing very well, thank you."
6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Mccoy,,I'm pleased you're doing well but I'm required to confirm that fact.

6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Mccoy,,You did.
6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Crater,,McCoy. I've heard Nancy speak of a Doctor McCoy.
6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Mccoy,,That's me. Didn't she mention I was here?
6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Crater,,You've seen Nancy?

6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Crater,,You've seen her too? You were with the good Doctor?
6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Kirk,,Yes. Why?
6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Crater,,"Nothing. It's just that it gives me pleasure to know that she's gotten to see an old friend and has a chance for some company. It's different for me, I enjoy solitude. But for a woman. You understand, of course."
6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Mccoy,,"Well, it certainly hasn't aged her. She looks exactly as I knew her twelve years ago. Amazing, Jim. Like a girl of twenty five."
6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Crater,,"Sorry. I'm sorry, Captain, sit down. I seem to have forgotten my manners."
6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Kirk,,Quite all right.
6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Mccoy,,"I'm not joking, Jim. She hasn't aged a day. She doesn't have a grey hair on her head."
6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Kirk,,"She's got some grey, Bones. Excuse me, Professor, she's a handsome woman, yes, but hardly twenty five."
6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Crater,,"You've seen my wife with the eyes of your past attachment, Doctor. I'm sure when Nancy lets, when you see her again she'll be a believable age."
6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Mccoy,,Well at any rate she doesn't look a day over thirty.
6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Crater,,"Genuine affection. I'm glad you still feel it for her. Leonard, isn't it? She's a fine woman."
6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Mccoy,,Open your mouth.

6,1,The Man Trap,planet surface,Kirk,,What happened?
6,1,The Man Trap,planet surface,Crater,,"What do you suppose happened, Captain? You beam down a crewman who doesn't know better than to eat an untested plant."
6,1,The Man Trap,planet surface,Kirk,,"I've just lost a crewman, Mrs. Crater. I want to know what happened."
6,1,The Man Trap,planet surface,Nancy,,"Well, I, I"
6,1,The Man Trap,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Take it easy, Nancy. Just tell us what you know."
6,1,The Man Trap,planet surface,Nancy,,"I was just. I couldn't find Bob, and I was coming back. I crossed to your crewman. I wanted him to know I wasn't offended by the things he'd said back there. You remember. Then I, I noticed he had a Borgia plant in his hand. Before I could say anything, he, he'd taken a bite from it. He fell, his face all twisted, and. Leonard, you're looking at me like you don't believe me."
6,1,The Man Trap,planet surface,Mccoy,,"No, no, no, no, it's not that. It's something entirely different. Jim, I suppose we could complete these examinations later."

6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Spock,,Cry?
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Uhura,,I was just trying to start a conversation.
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Spock,,"Well, since it is illogical for a communications officer to resent the word frequency, I have no answer."
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Uhura,,"No, you have an answer. I'm an illogical woman who's beginning to feel too much a part of that communications console. Why don't you tell me I'm an attractive young lady, or ask me if I've ever been in love? Tell me how your planet Vulcan looks on a lazy evening when the moon is full."
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Spock,,"Vulcan has no moon, Miss Uhura."

6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Uhura,,I don't believe it.
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Spock,,Explain.
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Uhura,,You explain. That means that somebody is dead and you just sit there. It could be Captain Kirk. He's the closest thing you have to a friend.
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Spock,,"Lieutenant, my demonstration of concern will not change what happened. The transporter room is very well-manned and they will call if they need my assistance."
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Mccoy,,She called it a Borgia plant.
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Kirk,,Something new to me.
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Spock,,Bridge to Dispensary.
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Kirk,,"Go ahead, Mister Spock."
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Spock,,Borgia plant listed in library record tapes as carbon group three vegetation similar to Earth nightshade family. Alkaloid poison. Chemical structure common to class M planets. About the strange mottling on his facial skin surface. There is no reference to this symptom.
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Hmm. Well then, this man wasn't poisoned."
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Kirk,,"Stand by, Mister Spock. She said she saw him eat the plant."
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Mccoy,,"She's mistaken. I know alkaloid poison, what to look for. There's not a trace of it in his body."
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Kirk,,There were bits of the plant in his mouth.
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Jim, don't tell me my business. He could not have swallowed any. My instruments would have picked up any trace of it whatsoever."
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Kirk,,Then what kills a healthy man
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I'll tell you something else. This man shouldn't be dead. I can't find anything wrong with him. According to all the tests he should just get up and walk away from here. I don't know. I'll have the tests double-checked. My eyes may be tricking me. I swear, Jim, when I first saw her she looked just as I'd known her ten years ago. Granted, for a moment I may have been looking at her through a romantic haze."
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Kirk,,"How your lost love affects your vision, Doctor, doesn't interest me. I've lost a man. I want to know what killed him."
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Yes, sir."
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Narrator,,"Captain's log, Stardate 1513.4. In orbit around planet M-113. One crewman, member of the landing party, dead by violence. Cause unknown, but we are certain the cause of death was not poison."
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Uhura,,"Message, Captain. Starship base on Caran 4 requesting explanation of our delay here, sir. Space Commander Dominguez says we have supplies he urgently needs."
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Narrator,,"Tell Jose he'll get his chili peppers when we get there. Tell him they're prime Mexican reds. I handpicked them myself, but he won't die if he goes a few more days without them. Got it?"
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Uhura,,"Got it, Captain."
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Kirk,,Well?
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Spock,,No mistake in our record tapes. Borgia plant. Its sole deadly property is alkaloid poison.
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Kirk,,And Professor Crater and wife?
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Spock,,"Check out perfectly. They arrived here nearly five years ago. Visited by various vessels, made fairly heavy shipments out, of artefacts and reports. However, there has been a marked drop in shipments during the last year."
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Mccoy,,Dispensary to Captain.
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Kirk,,Kirk here.
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Mccoy,,We found something.
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Kirk,,What is it?
6,1,The Man Trap,bridge,Mccoy,,I'd rather not put it on the speaker.
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Spock,,Fascinating.
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Mccoy,,So improbable we almost didn't check it.
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Kirk,,What?
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Spock,,Sodium chloride. Not a trace of it.
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Mccoy,,This man has no salt in his body at all.
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Kirk,,"Can you explain that, Doctor?"
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I can't, except that what we normally carry in our bodies is gone from his."
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Spock,,He would die almost instantly.
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Kirk,,How? There isn't a mark on his body.
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Mccoy,,Except the red rings on his face.
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Kirk,,You called that skin mottling.
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I thought it was, sir. Another error on my part."
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Kirk,,"I'm not counting them, Bones. Are you in the mood for an apology?"
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Oh, forget it. I probably was mooning over her. I should have been thinking about my job."
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Kirk,,Perhaps you were. Both Nancy and Crater went out of their way to mention one item they needed.
6,1,The Man Trap,sickbay,Mccoy,,Salt tablets.

6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Crater,,"Captain, you can't just beam down here and bully us, and interfere with our work."

6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Crater,,"We've been here for almost five years. If there were anything hostile here we would know about it, wouldn't we?"

6,1,The Man Trap,crater's home,Kirk,,"We're all aware of the need for salt on a hot and arid planet like this, Professor, but it's a mystery, and I don't like mysteries. They give me a bellyache and I've got a beauty right now."

6,1,The Man Trap,briefing room,Crater,,"Not because of tricks. It doesn't trick me. It needs love as much as it needs salt. When it killed Nancy, I almost destroyed it but, it isn't just a beast. It is intelligent and the last of its kind."

7,1,The Naked Time,rec room,Riley,,"Joey, give me the knife. (they fall to the floor, Tormolen gets stabbed in the stomach) Emergency! Rec room, area three nine. We need medics!"
7,1,The Naked Time,rec room,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, supplemental. Our orbit tightening. Our need for efficiency, critical. But unknown to us, a totally new and unusual disease has been brought aboard."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,"Relative gravity increasing, sir."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,"Compensate, Mister Riley."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,"Yes, sir."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Sulu,,"Magnetic field continuing to shift, sir. Planet continuing to shrink in mass."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,Mister Spock?
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,"All scanning stations manned, all recorders functioning, Captain."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,"Orbit steady now, sir."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,"Obviously, this planet is condensing more rapidly than expected. A valuable study. We may be seeing Earth's distant future. Before its sun went dark, this planet was remarkably similar to yours."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Sulu,,"Helm answering nicely, Captain."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,Good.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Uhura,,"Communications status, Captain."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,Tormolen's record?
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,"Psychiatric file, personality quotients."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,Was he trying to kill himself?
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,"It's doubtful he meant to. He was confused, self-tortured."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,Doesn't sound like the man I know.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,His capacity for self-doubt has always been rather high. What puzzles me is what brought it to the surface with so much force.
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Chapel,,"His breathing rate is dropping, Doctor."
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Mccoy,,Compensate with the respirator. Stand by to close. Closing.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,What is it?
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Sulu,,"Relative gravity increase, sir. Like the planet reached out and yanked at us."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,Compensate. (adjusts Riley's controls) Compensate.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,"Orbit steady now, sir. May be a little nervous, I guess."
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Mccoy,,This shouldn't be happening. This man should be getting stronger. You sure the respirator's functioning properly?
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Chapel,,"Yes, Doctor."
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Mccoy,,Why is this man dying? Hypo.
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Chapel,,"He's dead, Doctor."
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Mccoy,,The wounds were not that severe.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Mccoy,,This is McCoy. Captain Kirk to Sickbay.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,"Uhura, monitor communications. Tell McCoy I'll be there when I can."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,"Planet breakup is imminent, Captain. Shrinking in size at an increasing rate. As the planet continues to shrink in size, its surface moves away from us."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,Forcing us to spiral down to maintain the same distance from it.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,Exactly. We must be prepared to respond instantly to any sudden change.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,Engine room from Bridge.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Scott,,"Scott here, Captain."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,"Tie into the helm, Scotty. If we should call for power, we'll want it fast."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Scott,,"No problem, sir. You'll have it."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,Rate of compaction seems constant.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,"Then I'll go see what the good doctor wants. Keep me informed of any change, Mister Spock."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,Acknowledged.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Sulu,,Don't know if it's this planet or what happened with Joe. I'm sweating like a bridegroom.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,"Yeah, me too."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Sulu,,"Hey, why don't you come down to the gym with me, Kevin m'lad?"
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,Now?
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Sulu,,Why not? Light workout will take the edge off.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,"Sulu, what about. Hey, Sulu, don't be a fool!"
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Intestinal damage wasn't that severe. I got to him in plenty of time. That man should still be alive. The only reason he died, Jim, is he didn't want to live. He gave up."
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Kirk,,"That's a supposition, Doctor, not a fact."
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well, that may be. Maybe. I've lost patients before, but not like that. Not Joe's kind. That kind of man doesn't give up."
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Kirk,,Coincidence? Maybe.
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Mccoy,,You mean that Joe was down on the planet surface and you're gonna ask me if it's connected.
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Kirk,,That's exactly what I was going to ask.
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Jim, he was decontaminated. He's been medically checked. We've run every test we know for everything we know."
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Kirk,,That's not good enough.
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well, we're doing everything that's possible."
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Kirk,,"Bones, I want the impossible checked out too."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,Why isn't Mister Sulu at this station?
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,"Magnetic pull compensated for, sir. Orbit steady."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,"Take over here, Rand. (a male, not Janice)"
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Rand,,"Yes, sir."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,You haven't answered my question. Where is Mister Sulu?
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,"Have no fear, O'Riley's here. One Irishman is worth ten thousand of you"
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,"You're relieved, Mister Riley. Lieutenant Uhura, take over this station."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,Now that's what I like. Let the women work too. Universal suffrage.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,"Report to Sickbay, Mister Riley."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,"Sickbay? Exactly where I was heading, sir."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,Security. Mister Riley is headed for Sickbay. See to it he arrives. Captain Kirk to the Bridge.
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Riley,,Where's Joe?
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Chapel,,Well.
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Riley,,"He died, didn't he."
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Chapel,,Yes.
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Riley,,"You know something? You have such lovely eyes, pretty lady. (touches her face)"
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Chapel,,I know he was a friend of yours. This must be a terrible shock.
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Riley,,You know what Joe's mistake was? He wasn't born an Irishman.
7,1,The Naked Time,corridor,Sulu,brandishing foil,"Richelieu, beware! Stand. No farther. No escape for you. You either leave this bois bloodied, or with my blood on your swords. Cowards!"
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,"Lieutenant Brent, relieve Miss Uhura."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Brent,,"Yes, sir."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,What were their symptoms?
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,"Nonviolent at this stage. Slightly disoriented. Riley seemed rather pleased with himself, as if he were"
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,"Irrational, or drugged."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,Precisely.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,"Security, Lieutenant Uhura."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,"Both Sulu and Riley, locate and confine. I want every crewman who comes in contact with them medically checked."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Uhura,,"Sir, level two, corridor three reports a disturbance. Mister Sulu chasing crewmen with a sword."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,Put Security on it.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,"Fascinating. A pattern is developing. First, Tormolen. Hidden personality traits being forced to the surface. Then Riley, who fancies himself a descendant of Irish kings, and now Sulu, who is at heart a swashbuckler out of your 18th century."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,Present condition of Psi 2000.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,Gravity pull increasing. We've shifted to two percent and should stabilise our position.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,"Helmsman, stabilise position."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Leslie,,Helm is not answering to control.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,Warp us out of here.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Leslie,,"No response from engines, sir."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,Impulse power then. Blast us out of this orbit.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Leslie,,"Impulse engines also dead, sir."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,"Engine room, we need power!"
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Scott, acknowledge. Our controls are dead. Take her."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Sulu,,"Richelieu, at last."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,"Sulu, put that (discovers that the point is sharp) put that thing away."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Sulu,,"For honour, Queen, and France! (lunges)"
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Uhura,,Sulu.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Sulu,,Ah.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Uhura,,"Sulu, give me that."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Sulu,,"I'll protect you, fair maiden."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Uhura,,"Sorry, neither."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Sulu,,"Foul Richelieu. (distracted by Uhura's escape, Kirk is able to grab Sulu and Spock does a neck-pinch)"
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,I'd like you to teach me that sometime.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,Take D'Artagnon here to Sickbay.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,"Scotty, we need power. Engine room, acknowledge!"
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,"You rang, sir?"
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,Who's this?
7,1,The Naked Time,engineering,Riley,,This is Captain Kevin Thomas Riley of the starship Enterprise.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,And who is this?
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,"This is Captain Kirk. Get out of the engine room, navigator. Where's Mister Scott?"
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,"I've relieved Mister Scott of his duties. Now, attention, cooks. This is your captain speaking. I would like double portions of ice cream for the entire crew."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,"Clear that tube, will you?"
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,"And now, your captain will render an ancient Irish favourite. (sings) I'll take you home again Kathleen"
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,"Captain. At our present rate of descent, we have less than twenty minutes before we enter planet atmosphere."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,"And burn up. I know, Mister Spock."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,Wild and wide to where your heart
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, stardate 1704.4. Ship out of control, spiraling down towards planet Psi 2000. We have nineteen minutes of life left without engine power or helm control."
7,1,The Naked Time,corridor outside engineering,Kirk,,How did Riley get in there?
7,1,The Naked Time,corridor outside engineering,Scott,,"He ran in, said you wanted us on the Bridge."
7,1,The Naked Time,corridor outside engineering,Kirk,,He's cut off both helm and power.
7,1,The Naked Time,corridor outside engineering,Scott,,And he shut the door behind us and locked off the mechanism.
7,1,The Naked Time,corridor outside engineering,Kirk,,Can't you get to the auxiliary?
7,1,The Naked Time,corridor outside engineering,Scott,,I can't. He's hooked everything through the main panel in there. Get up to my office and pull the plans for this bulkhead. The only way to get that door open is to cut through these wall circuits here.

7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,"Continue the alert, Lieutenant."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Uhura,,"I can't, sir. He's cut off the alert channels."

7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,"You've interrupted my song. I'm sorry, but there'll be no ice cream for you tonight."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,Cut him off.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Uhura,,"I can't, sir. There's no way to do it."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,"Attention, crew. This is Captain Riley. There will be a formal dance in the bowling alley at nineteen hundred hours tonight."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Spock,,"No way, Captain. He controls the main power panels. He can override any channel from down there. Seventeen minutes left, sir. (ship is jolted severely)"
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Mccoy,,Sickbay to Bridge.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,Can you tie me in to the Sickbay?
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I'm getting you, Jim. Look, can you keep this beast level? I've got Sulu tranquillized and we're running tests on him."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Mccoy,,So far there's nothing unusual in his bloodstream. Body functions seem normal.
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,"Riley's the immediate problem, Doctor. Is there any way, anything you can do to snap him out of it?"
7,1,The Naked Time,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Negative, until I can get a little farther on these tests."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,"This is Captain Riley. Crew, I have some additional orders."
7,1,The Naked Time,engineering,Riley,,"In the future, all female crew members will wear their hair loosely, about their shoulders."
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Riley,,"And use restraint in putting on your makeup. Women, women should not look made up. And now, crew, I will render Kathleen one more time!"
7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Kirk,,"Please, not again."

7,1,The Naked Time,bridge,Mccoy,,"That's how we missed it. It passed from man to man through perspiration. Once in the bloodstream, it acts like alcohol, depresses the centres of judgment, self-control. Now get someone to the lab. Tell them the serum works, and start preparing more."

8,1,Charlie X,transporter room,Ramart,,"Wonderful boy, Charlie. Its been an honour having him aboard."
8,1,Charlie X,transporter room,Nellis,,"Why, it's been a great pleasure. The things that he's learned in the last"
8,1,Charlie X,transporter room,Ramart,,"Absolutely. To think this boy spent practically his whole life alone on that planet. Everyone killed, just a few microtapes to learn from."
8,1,Charlie X,transporter room,Charlie,,How many humans like me on this ship?
8,1,Charlie X,transporter room,Ramart,,"Like a whole city in space, Charlie. Over four hundred in the crew of a starship, aren't there, Captain?"
8,1,Charlie X,transporter room,Kirk,,"Four hundred and twenty eight, to be exact. Is there anything we can do for you, Captain? Medical supplies, provisions?"
8,1,Charlie X,transporter room,Charlie,,"Hundreds. All human, like me. That's exciting. Is that the right word?"
8,1,Charlie X,transporter room,Nellis,,That's perfect. It's the exact word.
8,1,Charlie X,transporter room,Ramart,,"You see. We'd like to keep Charlie with us, but with his closest living relatives on Colony Five and your vessel going that way, why"
8,1,Charlie X,transporter room,Charlie,,I'd like to see your ship now. All of it. The people and everything.
8,1,Charlie X,transporter room,Kirk,,"You keep interrupting, Mister Evans. That's considered wrong."

8,1,Charlie X,transporter room,Ramart,,Nothing.
8,1,Charlie X,transporter room,Kirk,,Not even Sarian brandy?
8,1,Charlie X,transporter room,Ramart,,"We're fine, thank you. Pleasant journey, Captain."

8,1,Charlie X,sickbay,Charlie,,Four?
8,1,Charlie X,sickbay,Mccoy,,Four-oh. One hundred percent. Sound of wind and limb.
8,1,Charlie X,sickbay,Charlie,,"That, that Captain. Kirk?"
8,1,Charlie X,sickbay,Mccoy,,Yeah.
8,1,Charlie X,sickbay,Charlie,,Why does he call me Mister Evans?
8,1,Charlie X,sickbay,Mccoy,,Because that's your name.
8,1,Charlie X,sickbay,Charlie,,"He's not, well, he isn't like Captain Ramart."
8,1,Charlie X,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well, no. Captain Kirk is one of a kind, Charlie."

8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Crewman 2,,"You got a deal, friend. (slaps man on bottom)"
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Crewman 1,,All right. (to Charlie) Hello.
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,I brought you a present.
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,,A bottle of perfume.,
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Rand,,"Oh, thank you. I really appreciate it, but, but I have to go. I'm on duty."
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,Do you like that kind?
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Rand,,"Yes, I, it's my favourite. Where did you get it? They don't have any in the ship's stores."
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,It's a present.
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Rand,,"I know, but where did? Gee, I'm late, Charlie. I really have to go."
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,Can't you stay and talk a little while?
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Rand,,"Look, I'm off duty at fourteen hundred. Why don't you join me in recreation room six, deck three."
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,"You got a deal, friend. (slaps her bottom)"
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Rand,,Charlie!
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,"I thought. Don't be angry. I didn't, I wanted."
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Rand,,"Charlie, you, you, you just don't go around slapping girls on the. It's okay, but er, just don't do it again."
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,Don't be angry.
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Rand,,"Look, why don't you tell Captain Kirk or Doctor McCoy what you did. They'll explain it to you. Okay?"
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,I will.
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Rand,,Okay.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Mccoy,,"But tell me, what reason would he have to lie if there are Thasians?"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Spock,,"That is a very intriguing question. Scanners show no disturbances in this quadrant, Captain."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"Good. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock is working out"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Uhura,,"Excuse me, Captain. Status report."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"Thank you. He's working out a training programme for Charlie Evans. Earth history, his own background, that sort of thing. I'd like you to give him the necessary medical orientation on the problems of, um, er, adolescence."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, don't you think it'd be better for a strong father image like you? He already looks up to you."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"The job is yours, Bones. Flattery will get you nowhere."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Spock,,"Doctor, didn't the boy make any reference at all to Thasians?"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"Do you believe the legend, Mister Spock, that Thasians still exist on that planet in some form?"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Spock,,Charlie's very existence proves in fact there must be some intelligent form of life on Thasus. He could not possibly have survived alone. The ship's food concentrates would have been exhausted in a year or so.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Mccoy,,"By which time he would have been eating fruits, vegetables."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Spock,,Probes of Thasus indicate very little edible plant life.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Mccoy,,"And probes have been known to be wrong, Spock."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Mccoy,,"Doctor, are you speaking scientifically or emotionally?"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"Gentlemen, the fact is the boy is here and he's alive and he needs our help."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Mccoy,,"And he needs a guide and he needs a father image, Jim."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"Hmm. I'll depend on your astute abilities to supply him with that, or find him one."
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,,Spock is strumming his lyre when Uhura starts humming. Spock stops,
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Uhura,,"I'm sorry. I did it again, didn't I."
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,,Spock smirks and Uhura begins playing again.,
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Uhura,singing,"Oh, on the starship Enterprise There's someone who's in Satan's guise Whose devil ears and devil eyes Could rip your heart from you. At first, his look could hypnotise And then his touch would barbarise His alien love could victimise And rip your heart from you. And that's why female astronauts, Oh, very female astronauts Wait terrified and overwrought To find what he will do. Oh, girls in space, be wary, be wary, be wary, Girls in space, be wary. We know not what he'll do."
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Rand,,One more time!
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Uhura,singing,"Now from a planet out in space, there comes a lad, not commonplace. A-seeking out his first embrace. He's saving it for you. Oh, Charlie's our new darling, our darling, our darling. Charlie's our new darling. We know not what he'll do."
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,,Uhura suddenly loses her voice and the lyre makes no sound.,
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Charlie,,Want to see something? (puts three cards face down) Turn them over. (They have pictures of Rand on them)
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Rand,,"Well, how did you do that?"
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Charlie,,"Oh, I can do a lot of card tricks. One of the men on the Antares showed me."
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,,The cards return to normal,
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Rand,,I don't believe this!
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,,"Hhe lays out the aces, throws one over his shoulder, then Rand removes it from her cleavage",
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Kirk,,"On Earth today, it's Thanksgiving. If the crew has to eat synthetic meat loaf, I want it to look like turkey. Charlie."
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,Captain? I'm supposed to ask you something. Why shouldn't I? I don't know how to explain it.
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Kirk,,"Say it right out, Charlie. That usually works."
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,"Well, in the corridor I saw. When Janice, when Yeoman Rand was. (slaps Kirk's bottom) I did that to her. She didn't like it. She said you'd explain it to me."
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Kirk,,"Me. I see. Well, um, er, there are things you can do with a lady, er, Charlie, that you er. There's no right way to hit a woman. I mean, man to man is one thing, but, er, man and woman, er, it's, er, it's, er. Well it's, er, another thing. Do you understand?"
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,I don't know.
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Uhura,,Captain Kirk.
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Kirk,,Excuse me. Kirk here.
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Uhura,,Captain Ramart of the Antares is on D channel.
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Kirk,,I'm on my way to the Bridge now.
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,Can I come with you?
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Kirk,,"I don't think so, Charlie."
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,I won't get in the way.
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Kirk,,Okay.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Uhura,,"Can you boost your power, Antares. We're barely reading your transmission."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Ramart,,"We're at full output, Enterprise. I must speak to Captain Kirk."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"Kirk here, Captain Ramart."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Ramart,,"Captain, we're just barely in range. I've got to warn"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,Re-establish contact.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Uhura,,They're not transmitting.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,Keep trying.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Charlie,,It wasn't very well constructed.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"Sweep the area of the Antares transmission with our probe scanners, Mister Spock."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Spock,,"Affirmative, Captain."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"You think something happened to the Antares, Charlie?"

8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Spock,,"Your mind is not on the game, Captain. Check. The Antares?"
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Kirk,,"A survey ship with twenty men aboard lost. No reason. Obviously, Captain Ramart was not aware of any trouble. I can't figure it."
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Spock,,My own concern is more immediate. The boy.
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Kirk,,"I can usually follow you, Mister Spock, but this time?"
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Spock,,He seemed to know what happened to the Antares before we did.
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Kirk,,"I'd call it a pretty long reach for evidence, Mister Spock. Come in, Charlie."
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Spock,,"And again, check."

8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Kirk,,"You play chess, Charlie?"
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Charlie,,"Oh, I, I watched them play on the Antares. Can I try?"
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Kirk,,I place you in the hands of our chess master.
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,,Kirk gets up and leaves,
8,1,Charlie X,recreation room,Spock,,"The principles of three-dimensional chess are basically mathematic, Charlie. You put the white here and the black on the secondary level."

8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Tina,,"Hello, Charlie."
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Rand,,I thought you might enjoy meeting someone your own age.
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,"Can I talk to you, alone."
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Rand,,"Charlie, Tina's"
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Tina,,Excuse me. I must be wanted somewhere.
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Rand,,"That was, that was rude and completely uncalled-for."
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,But I don't need her. I want to talk to you.
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Rand,,"That's no excuse. You'd better learn that right now. You have to live with people, Charlie. You're not alone anymore."
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,"But she's not as. She doesn't. She's not the same. Not like you. She's, she's just a girl. You're, you smell like a girl. All the other girls on the ship they, they look just like Tina. You're the only one who looks like you. You can understand, can't you? You know about being with somebody? Wanting to be? If I had the whole universe I'd give it to you. When I see you, I feel like I'm hungry all over. Hungry. Do you know how that feels?"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,What?
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Rand,,"I wasn't sure I should, er, talk to you about this."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,Charlie's a seventeen year old boy.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Rand,,"Exactly, and he's"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,I talked to him about the swat.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Rand,,"It's not that. Captain, I've seen the look before, and if something isn't done, sooner or later I'm going to have to hurt him. Tell him to leave me alone, and that wouldn't be good for him right now. You see, I'm his first crush, his first love, and his first"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, Yeoman, I'll talk to him. I'll look into it."

8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Come in, Charlie. Er, Charlie. Charlie, do you know anything about this chess piece? Did you notice anything peculiar in them when we were using them this afternoon?"
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Charlie,,"No, sir. Is that all?"
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Er, no. No, no. Sit down. Charlie, being seventeen is more than how many years you've lived. It's a whole other thing. Doctor McCoy could probably explain the biological conditions. Well, let's, let's use a specific. Yeoman Rand is a woman."
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Charlie,,"Oh, I won't hit her like that anymore."
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"No, there's more to it than that."
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Charlie,,"Everything I do or say is wrong. I'm in the way, I don't know the rules, and when I learn something and try to do it, suddenly I'm wrong!"

8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Charlie,,What if you care for someone? What do you do?
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"You go slow. You be gentle. I mean, it's not a one-way street, you know, how you feel and that's all. It's how the girl feels, too. Don't press, Charlie. If the girl feels anything for you at all, you'll know it. Do you understand?"
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Charlie,,You don't think Janice. You. She could love me!
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"She's not the girl, Charlie. The years are wrong, for one thing, and there are other things."
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Charlie,,She can.
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"No, Charlie."
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Charlie,,She is.
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,No.
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Charlie,,But if I did what you said! If I was gentle!
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Charlie, there are a million things in this universe you can have and there are a million things you can't have. It's no fun facing that, but that's the way things are."
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Charlie,,Then what am I going to do?
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Hang on tight and survive. Everybody does.
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Charlie,,You don't.
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Everybody, Charlie. Me, too."
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Charlie,,"I'm trying, but I don't know how."
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Kirk here.
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Uhura,,"You asked to be notified when we were to make our course adjustments, sir."
8,1,Charlie X,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Ask Mister Spock to see to it. Charlie, come on with me."
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,"You've got to slap the floor to absorb the energy when you fall. Go ahead, try it. Like everything else, it takes practice, Charlie. Try again. Good. That's much better. Here, now I'll show you a shoulder roll. Try that."
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Charlie,,I don't want to do that.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,"Well, it makes it hard to teach you"
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Charlie,,I don't want to do that.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,"All right, Charlie. Lesson's over for today."
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Charlie,,You were going to teach me how to fight.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,"You have to learn to protect yourself in a fall before I do that. It's more than teaching you to defend yourself. Charlie, I want you to learn. Charlie? Hey, Sam, let me borrow you for a couple easy throws, all right?"
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Sam,,Right.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,"Watch this, Charlie. That wasn't so bad, was it? Now I'll throw him. Here we go, Sam."
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Charlie,,That looks hard.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Sam,,Oh.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,"Come on, Charlie. Try it. Attaboy. Let's go."
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,,Charlie can't make Kirk lose his balance. He gets dumped instead.,
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Charlie,,Oh!
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,,Sam laughs.,
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,"That wasn't so bad, was it?"
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Charlie,,Don't laugh at me.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,Cool off.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Charlie,,Don't laugh at me!
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,,Sam disappears.,
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,Charlie.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Charlie,,He shouldn't have done that. It's not nice to laugh at people.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,"What happened to him, Charlie?"
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Charlie,,He's gone.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,That's no answer.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Charlie,,He's gone! I didn't mean to do that. He made me do it! He laughed at me.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Crewman,,Bridge.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,"Kirk here. Two men from security, on the double."
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Crewman,,Affirmative.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Charlie,,What are you going to do to me?
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,I'm confining you to quarters. I want you to stay there.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Charlie,,"I won't let them hurt me. I'll make them go away, too."
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,"They won't hurt you, Charlie. (security arrive) They'll take you to your quarters, Charlie. Go with them."
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,,"Charlie knocks them down, one draws his phaser",
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Charlie,,No! (phaser disappears)
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,Go to your quarters.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Charlie,,He was going to hurt me.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,Go to your quarters or I'll pick you up and carry you there.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Charlie,,I won't let you.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,"That's your choice, Charlie."
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Charlie,,I won't let them hurt me.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,They won't hurt you.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Uhura,,Captain Kirk.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,Kirk here.
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Uhura,,"Security reports that all phaser weapons have disappeared. Shall I repeat, Captain?"
8,1,Charlie X,gymnasium,Kirk,,"No, I heard you. Have Doctor McCoy and Mister Spock meet me in the Briefing room."
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Spock,,"Thasians have been referred to in our records as having the power to transmute objects or render substances invisible. It has generally been regarded as legend, but Charlie does seems to possess this same power."
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Kirk,,"What are chances that Charlie's not an Earthling, that he's a Thasian?"
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Mccoy,,"No, I don't think so, not unless they're exactly like Earthlings. The development of his fingers and toes exactly matches the present development of mans on Earth."
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Spock,,Agreed.
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Kirk,,"Well, whatever he is, we have some idea of the power he has. I know what I saw him do in the gymnasium."
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Considering the effect a normal adolescent has on a home, Charlie with the power he has"
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Kirk,,"Short-tempered, because he doesn't understand. He needs, he wants. Nothing happens fast enough."
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Spock,,"The probability is he's responsible for the destruction of the Antares, which would indicate a total disregard for human life."
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Kirk,,He doesn't understand what life is. He's a boy.
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Well, what do we do with this boy, Jim? How do we keep him caged up?"
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Kirk,,"It goes even further than that, Doctor. We can't take him with us to Earth Colony Five. Can you imagine what he'd do in an open, normal environment. I've talked with him, listened. He's a boy in a man's body, trying to be an adult with the adolescence in him getting in the way."
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Spock,,"And with a weapon in him which could destroy you or anyone, anywhere on this ship."
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Well, for the moment he's stopped. You're an authority he respects, Jim."
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Spock,,Agreed. The struggle must remain between you and him. Should any of us interfere
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,,Charlie enters under guard,
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Charlie,,"You wanted to ask me something, he said."
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Kirk,,"Are you responsible for what happened to the Antares, Charlie?"
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Charlie,,Why?
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Kirk,,Answer me.
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Charlie,,Yes. There was a warped baffle-plate on the shield of their energy pile. I made it go away. It would've blown up anyway. Well they weren't nice to me! They wanted to get rid of me. They don't now.
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Kirk,,"What about us, Charlie?"
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Charlie,,I don't know.
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,,Charlie leaves,
8,1,Charlie X,briefing room,Spock,,We're in the hands of an adolescent.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant, raise Colony Five. I want to speak directly to the governor."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"Navigator, lay a course away from Colony Five. Buy me some time."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Navigator,,"Yes, sir."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,,Uhura's console short-circuits and she is thrown to the floor,
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"Spock, get the doctor up here on the double. How bad is it?"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Uhura,,"I think it's all right, sir. Sir, there's no reason for that panel to cross-circuit like that. I checked it over myself not fifteen minutes ago."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Navigator,,"Captain! I can't feed any course co-ordinates into the panel, sir. It rejects the course change."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Pilot,,"Helm doesn't respond either, sir. (Charlie enters)"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, you getting any readings on your instruments?"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Spock,,"Yes, sir. There's a Tyger, tyger, burning bright in the forest of the night."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,Mister Spock.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Spock,,"I'm trying to Saturn rings around my head, down a road that's Martian red."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Charlie,,"You're trying to change course, Captain. You can't do that. I want to get to Colony Five as soon as we can."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,Release the transmitter.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Charlie,,You don't need all that subspace chatter.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Mccoy,,What's going on here? Spock calls me to the Bridge and goes into some kind of poetry.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"See to her, Doctor."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Spock,,"Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered, weak and weary."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Charlie,,"Very nice, Mister Ears. Oh, I can make him do anything, whirl around, laugh, anything."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"That's enough, Charlie."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Charlie,,Don't you think he's funny? I think he's funny.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,Leave my crew alone. (Charlie leaves)
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Spock,,"Jim, he'll soon reach a point where he won't back down."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,I know.
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Tina,,"Charlie, what's wrong? (he turns her into an iguana)"
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Charlie,,"I have something for you. (a rose) Pink is your favourite, isn't it?"
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Rand,,You don't walk into a room without knocking.
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Charlie,,"Don't ever lock your door on me again, Janice. I love you."
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Rand,,"I'll lock it when I please. What is it you want, anyway?"
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Charlie,,"You. I only want to be nice to you. I can give you anything. Just, just tell me."
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Rand,switching on comm.,I want you to get out.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Charlie,,But I only want to be nice to you.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Rand,,"Get out, Charlie."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,Spock.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Rand,,I can't make it any plainer than that.
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Charlie,,I love you.
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Rand,,You don't know what the word means.
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Charlie,,Then show me.
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Rand,,No!
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,,"Kirk and Spock rush in, Charlie knocks them down.",
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Rand,,Charlie!
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,,"She slaps him, so he makes her disappear.",
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Charlie,,"Why did she do that? I loved her, but she wasn't nice at all. What you did wasn't nice either, but I still need you, Captain. The Enterprise isn't quite like the Antares. Running the Antares was easy. You have to be nice. All right? (gives pain)"
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Kirk,,Mister Spock?
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Spock,,My legs. They're broken.
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Kirk,,"Let him go, too, Charlie."
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Charlie,,Why?
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Kirk,,"Because I'm telling you to. Because you need me to run the ship, and I need him."
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Charlie,,"If you try to hurt me again, I'll make a lot of people go away."
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Kirk,,And what about Yeoman Janice? Is she dead? Gone? Destroyed?
8,1,Charlie X,rand's quarters,Charlie,,"I won't tell you. Growing up isn't so much. I'm not a man, and I can do anything! You can't."
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Spock,,I'll activate the force field myself. You can return to your section.
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,He had a mean look. I had to freeze him. I like happy looks. (enters room) Aren't you coming in?
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,,A forcefield activates in the doorway so Charlie makes the wall go away and freezes Kirk and Spock.,
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,"That wasn't nice. You'll be sorry. You wait, you'll see, you'll be sorry you did that. (unfreezes them) You will."
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,,He turns a young woman into an old one. Some crew are laughing in a room.,
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,Charlie,,No. No laughing!
8,1,Charlie X,corridor,,"The shadows freeze, then a woman with no face feels her way around the corner",
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain Kirk, my instruments show we're receiving a message on subspace frequency three, ship-to-ship. I can't hear it, sir."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"Are you creating that message, Charlie, or you're blocking one that's coming in."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Charlie,,"It's my game, Captain. You have to find out. Like you said, that's how the game's played. You can have it now. I've locked on course for Colony Five again. (leaves)"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,I've waited long enough. I'm going to take him on.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Mccoy,,"You don't have any special immunity. Not anymore. Pushed far enough, he'd send you off to oblivion, too."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,Mister Spock?
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Spock,,Out of the question.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"Wait a minute. Does Charlie? Now, wait, Spock, has he done away with anybody since he took over?"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Spock,,Not so far as we know.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"Maybe he can't. Could be he's overreached himself. It's a big ship. He's taken full control. If we could tax his power, turn on every device on the ship, every circuit, every light, all of it, and while he's fighting that, if I could distract him, maybe you could tranquilize him, keep him under until we reach Colony Five."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Mccoy,,"Risky, Jim."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"If we don't try, Doctor, he'll get rid of us anyway. There's no choice, gentlemen, none at all."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Charlie,,I can make you all go away anytime I want to.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"Get out of my chair, Charlie, and get out of it now."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Charlie,,"I've got your ship, Captain."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"Maybe, Charlie, but I don't think you can handle any more. I think you've reached your limit and can't take on one more thing, but you're going to have to."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Charlie,,"I could've sent you away before, but I didn't."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,You're going to have to take me on.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Charlie,,Don't make me do it now.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"You've got my ship, and I want it back. I want my crew back, whole, if I have to break your neck to do it! (throws him out of command chair)"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Charlie,,Don't push me. (gives Kirk pain) Sorry. I'm sorry but. Stop it. I said stop it!
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, the navigation console is clear now. The ship is answering the helm."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Uhura,,"Sir, something off our starboard bow. The message says they're from Thasus."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,,Rand reappears,
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Charlie,,Oh.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Rand,,"Captain, how did I?"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"It's all right, Yeoman."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Spock,,"Sensors show there something's there, Captain. Deflectors indicate no solid substance."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Charlie,,"No! Oh, no, please, don't let them take me. I can't live with them anymore. You're my friends. You said you were my friends, remember? When I came aboard! Please, I want to go home. Take me home."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Thasian,,"I have taken my form from centuries ago, so that I may communicate with you. We did not realise until too late that the boy had gone, and we are saddened that his escape cost the lives of the first ship. We could not help them, but we have returned your people and your ship to you. Everything is as it was."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Charlie,,"I won't do it again. Please, I'll be good. I won't ever do it again. I'm sorry about the Antares. I'm sorry! When I came aboard! Please, I want to go with you. Help me!"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,The boy belongs with his own kind.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Thasian,,That would be impossible.
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"With training, we can teach him to live in our society. If he can be taught not to use his power"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Thasian,,"We gave him the power so he could live. He will use it, always, and he would destroy you and your kind, or you would be forced to destroy him to save yourselves."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,Is there nothing you can do?
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Thasian,,"We offer him life, and we will take care of him. Come, Charles."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Charlie,,"Oh, please, don't let them take me. I can't even touch them! Janice, they can't feel. Not like you! They don't love! Please, I want to stay. (fades away)"
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Uhura,,"Charlie's back on board the Thasian ship, sir. They signal they're leaving."
8,1,Charlie X,bridge,Kirk,,"It's all right, Yeoman. It's all over now."

Earth believes the Romulans to be warlike, cruel, treacherous, and only the Romulans know what they think of Earth. The treaty, set by sub-space radio, established this Neutral Zone, entry into which by either side, would constitute an act of war. The treaty has been unbroken since that time. Captain."

9,1,Balance of Terror,phaser control,Angela,,Acknowledge. All weapons batteries ready.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Stiles,,"Outpost four now five minutes away, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Spock,,"And showing on my sensors, Captain. At least it's still there."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Uhura,,"Sir, regaining contact with Outpost four. Switching to speakers."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Hansen,,"Outpost four. Do you read me, Enterprise? This is Commander Hansen."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"Kirk here. We're minutes away, Hansen. What's your status?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Hansen,,"Outposts two, three, and eight are gone. Unknown weapon. Completely destroyed, even though we were alerted. Had our deflector shield on maximum. Hit by enormous power. First attack blew our deflector shield. If they hit us again with our deflector shield gone. Do you read me, Enterprise?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"Confirm what hit you, Hansen. What vessel? Identity?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Hansen,,"Space vessel, only glimpse of."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Can you locate the intruder for us?
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Hansen,,Negative. It seems to have disappeared somehow. I have you on my screen now. Switching to visual.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Tie us in.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Uhura,,"Tied in, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,,"The viewscreen shows a man in a wrecked room, surrounded by fires",
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Hansen,,"Enterprise, can you see it? My command post here. We're a mile deep on an asteroid. Almost solid iron. And even through our deflectors, it did this. Can you see?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"Affirmative. You're visual, Hansen. What do you have on the intruder?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Hansen,,"No identification. No answer to our challenge. Only a glimpse of it. Then they fired something at us, some form of high-energy plasma. Fantastic power. And then the whole vessel disappeared. But it's out there somewhere. Our sensors show that much. Enterprise, something coming on our viewing screen, coming at us fast."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Lock us onto your screen.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Hansen,,"Switching. Can you see it, Enterprise? Can you see it? It's becoming visible in the centre of my screen."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,,A ship appears from nowhere on the screen,
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Do you have phaser capacity? We're still out of range.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Hansen,,Negative. Phasers gone. Weapons crew dead.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Make a challenge. Warn that ship off.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Uhura,,"Trying to, sir. They don't acknowledge."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,,"The alien ship fires a big red plasma ball, and the viewscreen switches to Hansen as the outpost is hit, then just bright light. Back to the attacking ship, which then vanishes.",
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Spock,,"Outpost four disintegrated, Captain."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"Position of the intruder, Mister Spock."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Spock,,Disappeared. Interesting how they became visible for just a moment.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,When they opened fire. Perhaps necessary when they use their weapon. SPOCK: I have a blip on the motion sensor. Could be the intruder.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Go to full magnification.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Sulu,,"Screen is on full mag, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,I don't see anything. I can't understand it.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Spock,,"Invisibility is theoretically possible, Captain, with selective bending of light. But the power cost is enormous."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Narrator,,They may have solved that problem.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Uhura,,"Continuing to challenge, sir. Still no response."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Discontinue. Contact remaining outposts. Have them signal us any sightings or sensor readings in their area.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Spock,,Blip has changed its heading. And in a very leisurely manoeuvre. They may not be aware of us.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"Their invisibility screen may work both ways. With that kind of power consumption, they may not be able to see us."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Spock,,"His heading is now one eleven mark fourteen. The exact heading a Romulan would take, Jim, for the Neutral Zone and home."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Parallel course.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Stiles,,"Don't you mean interception course, sir?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"Negative. You and Mister Sulu will match its course and speed with the object on our sensors exactly, move for move. If he has sensors, I want him to think we're a reflection, an echo. Under no circumstances are you to cross into the Neutral Zone without my direct orders."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Sulu,,"Acknowledged, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"Cancel battle stations. All decks, standby alert."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Sulu,,Cancel battle stations.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Stiles,,"Captain, may I respectfully remind the Captain what has happened? The Romulans have crossed the Neutral Zone, attacked our outposts, killed our men."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Mister Stiles.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Stiles,,Add to that the fact it was a sneak attack.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Stiles, are you questioning my orders?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Stiles,,"Negative, sir. I'm pointing our that we could have Romulan spies aboard this ship."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Sulu,,"I agree, sir. Respectfully recommend all decks maintain security alert."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"Very well. All decks, security alert."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Sulu,,"Security alert, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Uhura,,Picking up communication. It's from their ship.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Pipe it in.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Uhura,,"Sounds like code, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Spock,,"I have a fix on it, Captain. I believe I can lock on it, get a picture of their Bridge."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Put it on the screen.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,,"Up shimmers an image of a group of four humanoids around a console. One leaves his post and salutes the figure with his back to us. That figure then turns, and we see someone who looks just like - a Vulcan. Both Spock's eyebrows hit the ceiling. There's a long silence and a lot of stares.",
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Decoding?
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Uhura,,"Cryptography is working on it, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Stiles,,Give it to Spock.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"I didn't quite get that, Mister Stiles."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Stiles,,"Nothing, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Repeat it.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Stiles,,"I was suggesting that Mister Spock could probably translate it for you, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,I assume you're complimenting Mister Spock on his ability to decode.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Stiles,,"I'm not sure, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"Well, here's one thing you can be sure of, Mister. Leave any bigotry in your quarters. There's no room for it on the Bridge. Do I make myself clear?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Stiles,,"You do, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Uhura,,"Transmission has been cut off. (to Spock) I made a tape of it, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Spock,,Very well.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,,Runs the tape through his computer,
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Sulu,,"Something visual ahead, Captain, at extreme range. He's changing course, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"Stay with him, helm."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Sulu,,"Turning, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,,We're given a lovely shot of the bird painted on its belly,
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,We grow visible. Attend the cloaking system.
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Romulan,,"It consumes much power, Commander. With no enemy to concern us."
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,That Earth outpost called to an Earth vessel. Now it follows us.
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Romulan,,"Which neither retreats nor grows nearer. It turns as we turn. Commander, it is our judgment we run from a reflection."
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,"Perhaps so, but my judgment prevails."
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Romulan,,"Cloaking system on, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,It is good we approach the Neutral Zone. Not too soon for me to see the stars of home. I know they are following.
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Centurion,an older man,"If an Earth ship, why does he not attack?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,"First study the enemy, seek weakness. If I were their commander, that is what I would do."
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Decius,,My Commander sent for Decius.
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,A message was dispatched. You've broken the rule of silence.
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Decius,,"Only in code, Commander. To inform our Praetor of this glorious mission."
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,Your carelessness might have ended this glorious mission. You're reduced two steps in rank. Return to post.
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Centurion,,"Take care, Commander. He has friends, and friends of his kind mean power. And power is danger."
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,Danger and I are old companions.
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Centurion,,"We've seen a hundred campaigns together, and still I do not understand you."
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,"I think you do. No need to tell you what happens when we reach home with proof of the Earthmen's weakness. And we will have proof. The Earth commander will follow. He must. When he attacks, we will destroy him. Our gift to the homeland, another war."
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Centurion,,"If we are the strong, isn't this the signal for war?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,Must it always be so? How many comrades have we lost in this way?
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Centurion,,"Our portion, Commander, is obedience."
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,"Obedience. Duty. Death and more death. Soon even enough for the Praetor's taste. Centurion, I find myself wishing for destruction before we can return. Worry not. Like you, I am too well-trained in my duty to permit it. Continue evasive manoeuvres. Now, back to the first course."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Sulu,,"They're turning, sir. We're staying with them."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Spock,,"Steady on one eleven mark fourteen. Back on their original course, Captain, toward the Neutral Zone."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"What's our position, navigator?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Stiles,,"We'll enter the Neutral Zone in less than an hour, sir. Assuming, of course, that we don't turn back."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Scott,,"We now have aboard debris from Outpost four, Captain."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"Bring it to the briefing room. Are you ready, gentlemen?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Spock,,From the outpost's protective shield. Cast rodinium. This is the hardest substance known to our science.
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,,He crushes it with his hand,
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Spock,,Lab theorises an enveloping energy plasma forcing an implosion.
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Kirk,,Comments?
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Spock,,"Obviously, their weaponry is superior to ours, and they have a practical invisibility screen."
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Mccoy,,You're discussing tactics. Do you realise what this really comes down to? Millions and millions of lives hanging on what this vessel does.
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Spock,,"Or on what this vessel fails to do, Doctor."
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Kirk,,"Yes, well gentlemen, the question still remains. Can we engage them with a reasonable possibility of victory?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Scott,,No question. Their power is simple impulse.
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Kirk,,Meaning we can outrun them?
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Stiles,,"To be used in chasing them or retreating, sir?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Kirk,,"Go ahead, Mister Styles. I called this session for opinions."
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Stiles,,We have to attack immediately.
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Kirk,,Explain.
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Stiles,,They're still on our side of the Neutral Zone. There would be no doubt they broke the treaty.
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Sulu,,"Attack, without a visible target? How do we aim our phasers?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Stiles,,"Aim with sensors. Not accurate, but if we blanket them"
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Sulu,,And hope for a lucky shot before they zero in on us?
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Stiles,,"And if we don't? Once back, they'll report that we saw their weapons and ran."
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Sulu,,And if they could report they destroyed us?
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Stiles,,"These are Romulans! You run away from them and you guarantee war. They'll be back. Not just one ship but with everything they've got. You know that, Mister Science Officer. You've the expert on these people, always left out that one point. Why? I'm very interested in why."
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Kirk,,"Sit down, Mister."
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Spock,,I agree. Attack.
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Kirk,,Are you suggesting we fight to prevent a fight?
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Mccoy,,Based on what? Memories of a war over a century ago? On theories about a people we've never even met face to face?
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Stiles,,We know what they look like.
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Spock,,"Yes, indeed we do, Mister Stiles. And if Romulans are an offshoot of my Vulcan blood, and I think this likely, then attack becomes even more imperative."
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Mccoy,,"War is never imperative, Mister Spock."
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Spock,,"It is for them, Doctor. Vulcan, like Earth, had its aggressive colonising period. Savage, even by Earth standards. And if Romulans retain this martial philosophy, then weakness is something we dare not show."
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Spock,,Do you want a galactic war on your conscience?
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Kirk,,Captain to Bridge.
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Uhura,,"This is Uhura, Captain."
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Kirk,,What's our position?
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Uhura,,"Course unchanged, sir. Estimating treaty boundary in twenty one minutes."
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Kirk,,Are you continuing to broadcast tactical reports?
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Uhura,,"Affirmative, Captain."
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Kirk,,And at this distance?
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Uhura,,Approximately three hours before receiving a reply to our first message.
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Kirk,,"Thank you, Lieutenant. Check our course ahead, Mister Spock."
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Spock,,"A comet, magnitude seven, dead ahead, and the intruder changing course toward it."
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Kirk,,Comet Icarus four. Composition?
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Spock,,"Quite ordinary. An ionised mass, a trail of frozen vapour particles."
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Kirk,,"And when an object passes through it, even an invisible object?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Spock,,It leaves a visible trail.
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Kirk,,"Our chance, gentlemen. Prepare to attack. All hands, battle stations. I hope we won't need your services, Bones."
9,1,Balance of Terror,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Amen to that. We're taking a big gamble, Jim."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Battle status?
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Sulu,,"All stations manned, Captain."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Stiles,,Phaser weapons energised. Set for proximity blast.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Spock,,Intruder now bearing directly for comet's tail.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"Plot his exact point of entry, Mister Stiles."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Stiles,,"Computed. On the board, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"The moment he begins entering the comet's tail, he becomes visible. End run, gentlemen. We'll swing around the other side and catch him at that moment."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Sulu,,"Acknowledged, Captain."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Spock,,"He's maintaining that bearing, Captain."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"Let's get him, Mister Sulu."
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,How pleasing to the eye it is. Behold a marvel in the darkness.
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Centurion,,You spoke of entrapment.
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,"Its many particles will obscure their sensing device, Centurion."
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Romulan,,"We enter it, Commander."
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,"Once fully obscured, we will turn suddenly back upon our adversary."
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Romulan,,"At last the screen is clear, Commander."
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,Clear?
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Romulan,,Our reflection no longer follows us.
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,"Escape manoeuvre one, quickly!"
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Spock,,"We're losing sensor contact, Captain."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Steady as she goes. Phaser crews ready?
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Sulu,,"Phaser crew signal ready, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,He'll only be visible for a moment. Stand by.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Sulu,,"Sir, nothing in"
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"At the last moment he must have guessed our move. Hard to starboard, helm!"
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Sulu,,Hard to starboard.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"He did exactly what I would have done. I won't underestimate him again. Now, fire blind. Lay down a pattern."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Stiles,,Traverse pattern. All phasers fire.
9,1,Balance of Terror,phaser control,Robert,,"Phaser one, fire."
9,1,Balance of Terror,phaser control,Crewman,,"Phaser one, fire."
9,1,Balance of Terror,phaser control,,"Pulse phaser shots go into the darkness, rocking the Romulan ship",
9,1,Balance of Terror,phaser control,Robert,,"Phaser two, fire."
9,1,Balance of Terror,phaser control,Crewman,,"Phaser two, fire."
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,,The Centurion pushes his Commander out of the way of a falling beam,
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,Divert all power to weapons.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Sulu,,Phaser overload. Control circuit burnout.

9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Spock,,"It'll take time to correct, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, are they surrendering?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,,The Romulan ship has become visible,
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Full astern! Emergency warp speed!
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,,A red plasma blast is heading towards them,
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Do we have emergency warp?
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Sulu,,"Full power, sir. It's still overtaking us. If we can get one phaser working, sir, one shot might detonate it."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Navigation?
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Stiles,,"Estimate it'll overtake us in two minutes, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,"Phasers, Mister Spock?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Spock,,"Impossible, Captain."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Feed this to the space recorder and jettison immediately.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Rand,,"Captain, should I continue log entry?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,Yeoman. Affirmative. Continue log entries.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Rand,,"Yes, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Sulu,,"Ten seconds to impact. Captain, It's dissipating, sir."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Stiles,,It must have a range limit.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,,Rand stands as close as humanly possible to Kirk,
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Sulu,,"Five, four, three, two, one. Impact!"
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,,Everyone gets thrown about a bit,

9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Spock,,"He may think we're destroyed, Captain."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Kirk,,I wouldn't make that assumption. I don't think their Captain will either.
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Spock,,Intruder holding steady. Course one eleven mark fourteen.

9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Spock,,"They did, Doctor."
9,1,Balance of Terror,bridge,Mccoy,,"Once inside, they can claim we did. A set-up. They want war, we furnish the provocation."

9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,No need. The Centurion is dead.
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Decius,,"Why don't we fire, Commander?"
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Commander,,"No. No, he's shrewd, this starship commander. He tries to make us waste energy. He has estimated we have only enough. It is time. All debris into disposal tubes."
9,1,Balance of Terror,romulan ship,Decius,,"Yes, Commander."

10,1,What Are Little Girls Made Of?,dining room,Korby,,"I didn't mean to eavesdrop, darling. As you can see, Captain Kirk is fine. He won't be harmed. The things at stake here simply make it necessary he doesn't send a report to his ship. I need time to explain and demonstrate to him and to you. Now shall we start with Andrea?"

10,1,What Are Little Girls Made Of?,dining room,Kirk,,"If these mechanical things have no feelings and perform only as you programme them, then why did Brown try to shoot me? Why did he kill two of my men? There are many things I don't understand, Doctor."

At the same time, we duplicate the mental pattern. Now, physical pattern complete, we now make a mental pattern. Ready for final synaptic fusion. Andrea, stand by for cortex circuits. The android will be so perfect It could even replace the captain. The same memories, the same attitudes, the same abilities. Activate circuits."

11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,No promises. Give me the weapon.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Gelder,,"No! No. No, I'm not going back! I'll disable your vessel first. You choose, Captain. I'll destroy your control panel."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,,Gelder is distracted and Spock neck-pinches him,
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,Take him to Sickbay. Reverse course. Head back for Tantalus colony.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Abnormal, of course, but it's not schizophrenia, tissue damage, or any condition I'm acquainted with, Jim. And you know after getting him here, it took almost a triple dose of sedative to put him under."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Kirk,,Your report said he was quite talkative.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Mccoy,,"But not very informative. He claimed one thing, then he seemed to forget, and then he'd start to claim something else, but always with just the ring of truth in it. I'd sure like to study this one, Jim."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Kirk,,"Not our problem, Bones."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,"You smart, button-pushing brass hat. Wash your hands of it. Is that your system? You're both quite sure of yourselves, aren't you? Quite expert. Take him back. Let someone else worry about him."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Kirk,,What did you say your name was?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,"My name? My name is Simon Van Gelder. (in great pain) I was the director of, director at the Tantalus colony."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Mccoy,,You see what I mean?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,"I was a graduate of, of. I was assistant to Doctor. I knew. I knew, but they've erased it."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Mccoy,,Erased?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,"Edited, adjusted, subverted me, but I won't forget! I won't forget! You, you're so blind ignorant. You believe I belong back there, don't you? Dead or alive. Well, I won't let you take me back. I'm not going! I'll die first! Do you hear? I'm not going! No! No! No."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,Estimated arrival at Tantalus?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Spock,,"Fifty seven minutes, thirty seconds, Captain."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,What's so fascinating?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Spock,,An identification tape from our ship's library on Doctor Simon Van Gelder.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,Doctor Van Gelder?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Spock,,"Doctor Van Gelder, Captain. No mistake. There's a full ID tape on him."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,Committed to Tantalus colony when?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Spock,,Assigned there six months ago as Doctor Adams' associate.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,"Ship to surface, Tantalus colony."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Uhura,,"Hailing frequency's open, sir."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,U.S.S. Enterprise to Tantalus colony.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Woman,,Tantalus.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,This is Captain Kirk. I'd like to speak to Doctor Adams.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Woman,,"Stand by, Enterprise."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Adams,,"Captain Kirk, Doctor Adams here."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,"Doctor Adams, regarding your escaped man"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Adams,,"Is Doctor Van Gelder all right? And your people, no injuries?"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,"No casualties, sir. This man is Doctor Simon Van Gelder?"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Adams,,"Yes, of course. You're certain he's all right? We've been very concerned. In the violent state he's in"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,"No harm to him, sir. We thought you might enlighten us as to his condition."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Adams,,"He'd been doing some experimental work, Captain, an experimental beam we'd hoped might rehabilitate incorrigibles. Van Gelder felt he hadn't the moral right to expose another man to something he hadn't tried on his own person."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,"Tragedy, Doctor."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Mccoy,,"Jim, that doesn't quite ring true."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,"Er, Doctor Adams, please stand by. Explain."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Mccoy,,"I don't believe him. I can't explain it, but the more I study that patient"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,"You don't believe him, and you can't explain it. Bones, are you aware that in the last twenty years Doctor Adams has done more to revolutionise, to humanise prisons and the treatment of prisoners than all the rest of humanity had done in forty centuries? I've been to those penal colonies since they've begun following his methods, and they're not cages anymore."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Mccoy,,Jim
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,"They're clean, decent hospitals for sick minds."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Mccoy,,"Jim, listen!"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Spock,,"Gentlemen, I suggest you ask Doctor Adams if he wants Van Gelder returned."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,"Doctor Adams, regarding Van Gelder."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Adams,,"Yes, Captain. May I inquire about your patrol destinations? Are you passing near any hospital facilities superior to ours? I'd like Van Gelder to have the best possible treatment, of course."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,"Thank you, Doctor. I'll take it up with the ship's surgeon. Stand by. Well, Bones, you've got the ball. You care to recommend a better place?"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Mccoy,,"There are no superior facilities, he knows that. But that's not the question. If something unusual is going on down there"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,"An assumption, Doctor."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Mccoy,,"I'm required to enter any reasonable doubts into my medical log. That requires you to answer in your log. Sorry, Jim."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,"Doctor Adams, this is rather embarrassing. By strict interpretation of our starship regulation, I'm required to initiate an investigation of this so that a proper report"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Adams,,"No need to apologise, Captain Kirk. In fact, I'd take it as a personal favour if you'd beam down and look into it yourself. I'm sure you realise we don't get too many visitors here. Oh, I, er, Captain, I would appreciate it if you could come down with a minimum staff. We're forced to limit outside contact as much as possible."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,"Affirmative, Doctor. I've visited rehab colonies before. Enterprise out. Find me someone in your department with psychiatric and penology experience, if possible."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Mccoy,,"Yes, sir."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 2715.2. Standard orbit, planet Tantalus V."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,"Mission, routine investigation and report as per ship surgeon's medical log. As for my last entry, it seems I will get to meet Doctor Adams at last. However, I would have preferred other circumstances. Sickbay. Report, Doctor."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Mccoy,,"Van Gelder's still violently agitated, Captain."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,And you'd prefer to keep him here until I complete my investigation anyway.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Spock,,"I believe we should, Jim."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Mccoy,,"Oh, I'm assigning your technical aide, Captain. One of our psychiatrists does have a background in rehabilitative therapy. Doctor Noel, standing by in the transporter room now."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,bridge,Kirk,,"Thank you, Doctor. Bridge out. Mister Spock."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,transporter room,Kirk,,Co-ordinates?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,transporter room,Berkeley,,"Locked in, sir. Ready to beam down."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,transporter room,Noel,,"Doctor Helen Noel, Captain. We've met. Don't you remember the science lab Christmas party?"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,transporter room,Kirk,,"Yes, I remember."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,transporter room,Noel,,You dropped in
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,transporter room,Kirk,,"Yes, yes, I remember."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,transporter room,Spock,,"Problem, Captain?"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,transporter room,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, you tell McCoy that she had better check out as the best assistant I ever had. Energise."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,transporter room,Berkeley,,Energise.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,building entrance,Kirk,,"In here, I presume, Doctor."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,building entrance,Noel,,"Perhaps it would be simpler if you called me Helen, Captain, since"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,building entrance,Kirk,,"This is another time, another place, and another situation."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,building entrance,Noel,,"Of course, Captain."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,turbolift,Kirk,,"Elevator, and going down quite a ways."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,turbolift,Noel,in his arms,I wouldn't recommend it for weak hearts.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Adams,,"Hello Captain Kirk, and er"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Kirk,,"Doctor Helen Noel. It's a pleasure to finally meet you, sir."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Adams,,"Thank you. Thank you, Captain. Welcome to Devil's Island, Doctor."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Noel,,"Perhaps you'll call me Helen, Doctor. With so many titles around, we're not going to be sure who's talking to who."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Adams,,I shall indeed. Won't you?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Noel,,Thank you.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Kirk,,I believe regulations call for me to check my weapon.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Adams,,"No, no. That won't be necessary in your case, Captain. Just keep it out of sight, hmm? I know you people feel as naked without a weapon as we do without a medikit. A small toast. Do you mind? It's such a great day for us here on Tantalus when we have visitors, no matter what the excuse."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Kirk,,Doctor.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Adams,,"Oh, now, Captain, you made your apology from upstairs. Now forget it. I don't think you'll be able to get through the security screen, Captain. Just a second, hmm? There. Now try it."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Spock,,Enterprise. Spock here.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Kirk,,"Your landing co-ordinates were right on the nose, Mister Spock. We arrived safely, and we're here with Doctor Adams right now. Kirk out."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Spock,,"Affirmative, Captain. Enterprise out."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Adams,,"Ah, Lethe, come in. Lethe, this is Captain Kirk and Doctor Helen Noel. Lethe came to us for rehabilitation and stayed on as a therapist, and a very good one too, I might add."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Lethe,,I love my work.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Adams,,"Go right ahead, Captain."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Kirk,,Before you came here
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Lethe,,"I was another person, malignant, hateful."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Kirk,,May I ask what crime you committed?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Lethe,,Does it matter? That person no longer exists.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Adams,,"Um, part of our cure, if you will, Captain, is to bury the past. Why should a person go on living with unbearable memories if there's no necess. Oh, I feel quite sure that you'd concur with me in that, Doctor. Helen."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Noel,,A shifting of memory patterns is basic to psychotherapy.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Adams,,"Yes. And now to the toast, hmm? You'll forgive us, Lethe. There you are, Captain. To all mankind. May we never find space so vast, planets so cold, heart and mind so empty that, that we cannot fill them with love and warmth."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,corridor,Kirk,,"Quite a tour, Doctor. Very impressive."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,corridor,Adams,,"Thank you. Hi, Carl."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Kirk,,Doctor.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Adams,,Yes?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Kirk,,Hmm?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Adams,,"Ah. I was afraid you would ask about this, Captain. One doesn't like to talk about their personal failures, you know? It was just an experiment that went wrong, I'm afraid."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Kirk,,May I see it?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Noel,,"Captain, if something hasn't worked out and therefore has no scientific fact"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Kirk,,Shall we leave it up to the doctor?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Noel,,"Since you brought me down here for advice, Captain"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Kirk,,"One of the advantages of being a Captain, Doctor, is being able to ask for advice without necessarily having to take it."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Adams,,"I think I'll have to award that round to the Captain, Helen. You're fighting over your weight. All right, let's take a look."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,I'm not a criminal! I do not require neural neutraliser.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,"Neural neutraliser. Can you explain that, Doctor Van Gelder?"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,A room. A device. Door. Control panel. I see it. A device. A light! The light!
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,This room. What happens there?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,(screams)
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Adams,,"A neural neutraliser. Experimental. Actually, we don't expect to get much use out of it at all. That beam from above neutralises brain waves, relaxes the patient's mind. Does them no harm, of course, and the effects are only temporary."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Kirk,,"One question, Doctor. If it doesn't do any good"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Adams,,"Why do we go on using it, hmm, Captain? Hope. Yes, yes, there's always that slight chance that it might do some good in the more violent cases."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Noel,,"Tranquillisers are fine, Captain, but to continually pump chemicals into a person's bloodstream"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Adams,,"Exactly my point, Helen. Yes. Shall we? (he and Noel leave)"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Kirk,to therapist,How does it work?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Therapist,,"Quite simple. Off on switches, and the large control here changes the strength of the brain neutralising beam."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Adams,,"Captain, you remind me of the ancient sceptic who demanded of the wise old sage to be taught all the world's wisdom while standing on one foot."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Noel,,"Beam neutralising has been experimented with on Earth, Captain. I'm not acquainted with this particular style of equipment, but I can assure you that Doctor Adams has not created a chamber of horrors here."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Kirk,,"I didn't mean to suggest that he had. The reason I asked, sir, was you haven't mentioned where Doctor Van Gelder's injury occurred."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Adams,,"Right here, Captain. Yes, Simon was a very stubborn man. He could've sat in that room for years with the beam at that volume or even higher. Or if he simply had someone standing by to snap it off in case he got into trouble, but, but no. He tried it alone and on full volume. It's a pity."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Kirk,to therapist,Thank you. (leaves)
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Therapist,to man in treatment chair,"You will forget all you have heard. To remember any portion of it, any word, will cause you pain, terrible pain, growing more terrible as you fight to remember."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,"Can you give us your present location, Captain?"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Kirk,,"In Doctor Adams' study, Mister Spock. Why?"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,Then you're with Doctor Adams now.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Kirk,,Affirmative.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,"Captain, Van Gelder has made reference to a particular treatment room. The term was neural neutraliser."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Kirk,,Yes. He was injured there. I've seen the room. Doctor Adams explained
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Kirk,,the mistake Van Gelder made.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Kirk,,"Go ahead, Mister Spock. Anything further?"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Adams,,"Your Mister Spock sounds like a very excellent second in command, Captain Kirk. Please tell him to go ahead and speak freely. I have to check in with a member of my staff anyway."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Kirk,,"Thank you, Doctor Adams."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Adams,,Excuse me.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Kirk,,"Stand by, Mister Spock. Doctor Adams has left with some things to attend to. What is it, Mister Spock?"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,"Van Gelder is extremely agitated, Captain, and warns that you are in danger."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Noel,,"Oh, that's foolish."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Spock,,"Please repeat, Captain. I didn't receive that."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Kirk,,"Tell McCoy the technical expert he sent along with me insists that any concern is unjustified. According to Adams, Van Gelder created his own problem."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Noel,,He's suffering from
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Noel,,"neuro-synapse damage, as if his brain were short-circuited. It's no wonder he's having delusions."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Mccoy,,McCoy here. Received and understood.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Mccoy,,"But we still have some doubts up here, Captain. Can you tell us any more?"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Kirk,,Not really.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Spock,,"When do you plan to beam back up, Captain?"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Kirk,,"I think we'll spend the night here, Mister Spock."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,"No! No, no, no."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,And you will continue to check in every four hours?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Kirk,,Affirmative.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,adam's study,Kirk,,Kirk out.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,"No! No. No, don't let them! You must warn your captain. No! No! Don't let him stay! Don't let him stay! Don't! No. No. Don't hypo me. Please, don't hypo me. I'll try not to fight. I'll try. But you must listen. Warn your Captain. Doctor Adams. Doc, Doctor Adams will destroy."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,Destroy how? What?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,Right death.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,"Enterprise log. First officer Spock, acting captain. I must now use an ancient Vulcan technique to probe into Van Gelder's tortured mind."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Spock, if there's the slightest possibility it might help."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,"I've never used it on a human, Doctor."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Mccoy,,If there's any way we can look into this man's mind to see if what he's seeing is real or delusion
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,"It's a hidden, personal thing to the Vulcan people, part of our private lives."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Now look, Spock, Jim Kirk could be in real trouble. Will it work or not?"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,"It could be dangerous. Do you understand? It requires I make pressure changes in your nerves, your blood vessels."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,You must open my mind. Let me warn you and explain to you.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,"This will not affect you, Doctor McCoy, only the person I touch. It is not hypnosis."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I understand. (Spock puts his hands on Gelder's face) Good, the reading's levelling."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,You begin to feel a strange euphoria. Your body floats.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,"Yes, I begin to feel it."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,Open your mind. We move together. Our minds sharing the same thoughts.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,noel's room,Kirk,,Good evening.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,noel's room,Noel,,Good evening.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,noel's room,Kirk,,What did you think of the inmates we saw here this afternoon?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,noel's room,Noel,,"You could've waited until tomorrow morning to ask me that, Captain."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,noel's room,Kirk,,I didn't.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,noel's room,Noel,,"I thought they were happy, well-adjusted."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,noel's room,Kirk,,But a bit blank.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,noel's room,Noel,,"Captain, if you're questioning the methods of a man like Tristan Adams"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,noel's room,Kirk,,I'd like to see that treatment room again. You say you're somewhat familiar with the theory behind it?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,noel's room,Noel,,"Yes, somewhat, but if you'd simply state any doubts you have to Doctor Adams"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,noel's room,Kirk,,"And if he's lying, he'll continue to lie, and I won't find out a thing. The only way I can be sure is to see that machine at work, or is that too impractical and unscientific of me, Doctor? Well?"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,noel's room,Noel,,Coming.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,What is our name? Who are we?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,We are Simon Van Gelder.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,Doctor Adams. The neural neutraliser. What did he do to us?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,"He can reshape any mind he chooses. He used it to erase our memories, put his own thoughts there. He was surprised it took so much power. We fought him, remember? But we grew so tired, our minds so blank, so open, that any thought he placed there became our thoughts. Our minds so empty like a sponge, needing thoughts, begging. Empty. Loneliness. So lonely to be sitting there empty, wanting any word from him. Love."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,Yes.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,Hate.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,Yes.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,Live.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,Yes.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,Die.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,Yes.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,Such agony to be empty.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,Empty.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,Lonely.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,Lonely.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,So empty.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Spock,,Empty.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,sickbay,Gelder,,So empty.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Kirk,,I have no desire to damage my brain. Can this be handled with reasonable safety? Yes or no?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Noel,,Yes.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Kirk,,And will you be able to determine if that beam is harming me in the slightest?
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Noel,,"Yes, Captain. I know my profession. (Kirk sits in treatment chair) Ready?"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Kirk,,Mm-hmm.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Noel,,"We'll try minimum intensity, a second or two. (light turns)"
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Kirk,,"Anytime you're ready, Doctor, just for a second or two."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Noel,,"We already tried it for that long, Captain."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Kirk,,Nothing happened.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Noel,,Something happened. Your face went completely blank.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Kirk,,Try a harmless suggestion.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Noel,light turns,You're hungry.
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Kirk,,"You know, when we finally get through this I'd like to locate and raid a kitchen somewhere."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Noel,,"I put that suggestion in your mind, Captain. I said simply that you were hungry."
11,1,Dagger Of The Mind,treatment room,Kirk,,Remarkably effective for a device that Doctor Adams was going to abandon.

It has to connect with other ducts and tunnels. You can get through this. It might lead to the power supply. Short-circuited, it would cut off the security force field.

12,1,Miri,house,Kirk,,You're doing fine.
12,1,Miri,house,Mccoy,,You said the Grups got sick. Is that why there aren't any of them around?
12,1,Miri,house,Miri,,"Yes. They died, but that was after the awful things."
12,1,Miri,house,Mccoy,,"A plague, Captain. That could explain a lot of it."

12,1,Miri,house,Spock,,"Children, Captain. Lots of them. We couldn't begin to get close to them. They just seemed to scurry away, like animals. Only children."
12,1,Miri,house,Kirk,,Miri said all the adults died.
12,1,Miri,house,Mccoy,,That creature which attacked us was certainly no child. Perhaps it died of the disease the girl's talking about.
12,1,Miri,house,Kirk,,"There must be records somewhere and answers to some of our questions. Miri, do you know any buildings where the doctors used to work?"
12,1,Miri,house,Miri,,"Yes, I know that. Them and their pills and things."

12,1,Miri,house,Miri,,"It's already starting. I knew it would. Just like it did with the Grups. It'll spread all over you, and you'll yell, and you'll try to hurt everybody and then you'll die. I knew it would! I knew it would!"
12,1,Miri,house,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, stardate 2713.6. The building Miri led us to also housed an automatic transmission station, which sent out the signal that drew us to this planet. We also discovered something else. That the blues blotches, characteristic of the unknown disease had appeared on each of us, with the exception of Mister Spock. There was a well-equipped laboratory in the building. Doctor McCoy took tissue samples of each of us in an attempt to isolate the organism responsible."

12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,I don't know. Probably the little bugs or whatever they are have no appetite for green blood.

12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,Of course. It changes the entire body system. You know that. Of course you know that. Why?
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,"Is it not possible that these children here, as they enter puberty, contract the disease?"
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,That would explain why there are no adults.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,"Glandular, post-pubescent. Could be."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,"It's illogical. It does not follow. All the adults on this planet died three hundred years ago, but there are children in the streets."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,Who die when they enter adolescence.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,But how do they keep the line going?

12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,"Loneliness? I don't know, curiosity? I think children have an instinctive need for adults. They want to be told right and wrong."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,"There may be other emotions at work in this case, Captain."

12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,Thank you.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,"According to their life prolongation plan, what they thought they were accomplishing, a person would age only one month for every one hundred years of real time."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Rand,,One hundred years and only one month?
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,"Exactly, Yeoman. Evidently through some miscalculation, this virus annihilated the entire adult population in a very short period, leaving only the children."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Rand,,But that means these children
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,Could very well be immensely old.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,That would certainly answer the question of what happened to their parents.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,Answers it very well.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Rand,,"Children who never age. Eternal childhood, filled with play, no responsibilities. It's almost like a dream."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,"I wouldn't examine that dream too closely, Yeoman. It might not turn out to be very pretty."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,A few days ago or a week ago that creature that attacked us could have been just like Miri. A child entering puberty on this planet means a death sentence.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Rand,,Do you suppose she knows?
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,I don't think so.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Rand,,"If they're as old as Spock claims, they must have some idea of what's happening."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,"There's no adult interpretation. I think we're dealing with children. Immensely old perhaps, but nonetheless children. We've got to do something about the others."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,"Difficult, if we can't even get a glimpse of them."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,You couldn't get close to the other kids?

12,1,Miri,old toy shop,Red Head Boy,,"I remember, Jahn, the way it was."
12,1,Miri,old toy shop,Jahn,,"That's right, the way it was in the before time. They talk to the other Grups with these little boxes. Now, if they didn't have those little boxes, they'd be all alone, huh?"

12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,"We could use some more, if you don't mind."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Miri,,"No, I don't mind."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,There couldn't be any doubt about what you found here?
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,"This fellow made these notes in the last weeks after the disaster began. I disregard these last entries. He said himself he was too sick, too far gone to be sure he wasn't already mad, and I agree, but based on the entries he made before that, I know how much time we have. The ship's computers will verify my figures."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,"Only a matter of time before we all go mad, destroy each other, till the last of us finally destroys himself."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,What about Miri?
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,Our guess was correct. They contract the disease as they enter puberty and their metabolism changes. The notes would indicate it doesn't become acute for a month or so. I estimate she has perhaps five or six weeks left.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,What about us?
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,"The older the victim, the more rapid the progress of the disease."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,And you? The disease doesn't seem to be interested in you.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,"I am a carrier. Whatever happens, I can't go back to the ship, and I do want to go back to the ship, Captain."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,"Of course, Mister Spock. We still don't know what we're fighting."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,"No, but we know what it is and how fast it does it. It's progressing. We'll begin to feel it inside soon. Intense fever, great pain in the extremities, fuzziness of vision. Of course, those are the early symptoms. There'll be more."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,Are You certain about the time we have left?
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,I presume my calculations are correct.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,Is there any possibility

12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,"Verified, Captain. We have seven days."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, supplement. This is the second day of the seven left to us. We've found nothing. Enterprise is standing by with labs and computers ready to assist us."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,"There's no data, no starting point."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,I think I've found it.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,"Janice, take Miri for a walk."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Rand,,"Yes, sir."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,Only one half intact.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,But do you know what they were up to?
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,"More or less. The idea was to create a new series of diseases, a chain reaction of viruses meant essentially to extend the life of the human cell immeasurably."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,"Unfortunately, they weren't successful. We've seen the results."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,"You two will have to recreate their thinking. If you can isolate that virus, we'll be able to develop a vaccine."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,"Is that all, Captain? We have five days, you know."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,I know.

12,1,Miri,corridor outside laboratory,Kirk,,And you? (clunk as grate closes)
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,"Communicators, Captain, they're gone."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,"Jim, We've absolutely got to have those communicators. Without them, we don't have the computers, and without the computers, we don't have a chance."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, stardate 2717.3. Three days, seven hours left to us. Investigation proves that the supply of food in the area is running dangerously low. Unless something is done, the children will starve in a few months. The disease is working on each of us according to Doctor McCoy's prediction. Our tempers are growing short, and We're no further along than we were two days ago."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,Haven't you found a thing yet?
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,Would you like to take a crack at it?
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Rand,as Kirk pushes past and makes her drop flasks,"No! No! No! (runs out, Kirk follows, then Miri)"
12,1,Miri,corridor,Rand,,"I'm upset, so upset. Back on the ship, I used to try to get you to look at my legs. Captain, look at my legs. (covered in blotches)"
12,1,Miri,corridor,Kirk,holds her,We're all frightened. (Miri leaves)
12,1,Miri,corridor,Mccoy,,"Jim, I found something!"
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,"The last slide I examined, I failed to make the necessary adjustment. The slowing down of my own responses"
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,"Never mind that, what did you find?"
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,"The disease, Captain, the one they created three hundred years ago."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Rand,,There's a chance!
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,"A chance. At least it's a race now, and we've just wasted a minute."
12,1,Miri,old toy shop,Jahn,,"That would be some foolie, Miri, but do you think it would work?"
12,1,Miri,old toy shop,Miri,,"I know. I know. Don't you think I've heard them talk? They have such little time to do this dumb thing of theirs, this buttinsky thing. If we get her away. that Yeoman, that's one person less to start off with."
12,1,Miri,old toy shop,Masked Boy,,"But how, Miri? If they're so busy, if they're going to have the big emergency, how are you going to get her away?"
12,1,Miri,old toy shop,Miri,,"It's easy. She's always asking me about the youngest little Onlies, little ones. What if they get sick, who takes care of them? Do they have enough to eat? Where do they sleep? I'll just tell her one of you fell down and got hurt."
12,1,Miri,old toy shop,Red Head Boy,,Me. Say it's me.
12,1,Miri,old toy shop,Miri,,"All right, you."
12,1,Miri,old toy shop,Jahn,,"But Grups, they know things and all that. You know, I bet they'll be able to do it with one person less."
12,1,Miri,old toy shop,Miri,,"Not one, two. Because he'll try to find her."
12,1,Miri,old toy shop,Red Head Boy,,"Who? Who will, Miri?"
12,1,Miri,old toy shop,Miri,,"The Captain. He'll try to find her, but he won't. Mister Lovey-dovey."
12,1,Miri,old toy shop,Red Head Boy,,Lovey-dovey. Bonk bonk on the head. Bonk bonk! bonk bonk!
12,1,Miri,old toy shop,Children,,Bonk bonk! Bonk bonk!
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,It looks right.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,"The nitrogen cycle, it has to be."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,"But the question is, what's the dosage?"
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,That is a very good question.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,"Where is she, Miri? Where is she, Miri? Where's Janice?"
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Miri,,What's the matter with you? How should I know?
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,Where is she? Has something happened to her?
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Miri,,Don't you feel all right?
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,"No, I don't feel all right! None of us feel all right! Can't you see what's going on?"
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Miri,,"Jim, I don't want anything to happen to you."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,I've got to find Janice.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,"That's not all, Captain. We've got to find those communicators."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,"We're trying, Mister Spock. We're trying very hard."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,"That's not good enough! This could be it, but we can't test it without the ship's computers."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,"We've got to have those communicators, Jim."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,This is the vaccine?
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,That's what the computers will tell us.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,"Without them, it could be a beaker full of death."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,Did you hear them? We only have a few hours left.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Miri,,I don't care.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,"You've got to care. Miri, I'm going to tell you something. You, your friends, all the Onlies are going to get the disease unless we succeed in what we're doing. You've seen your friends get it."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Miri,,Sometimes it happens.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,"Not sometimes. All the times, Miri! As soon as you start growing up the way you are. Don't you know why you don't like to play games anymore, why you don't see your friends the way you used to? It's because you're becoming a young woman, and the moment you become a young woman, you get the disease. All of you."
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Miri,,That's not true. It just happens sometimes.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Kirk,,"All the time, Miri! It's happening to you right now! Look at it. Look at it, Miri, it's in you!"
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Miri,,No! No! No!
12,1,Miri,schoolroom,Red Head Boy,,"Blah, blah, blah!"

12,1,Miri,schoolroom,Red Head Boy,,Blah blah blah!
12,1,Miri,schoolroom,Kirk,,"No blah blah blah! Because if we don't talk to the ship, if you don't help us, there won't be any games anymore. There won't be anything. Nothing, no Grups, no Onlies, nobody left forever and ever."
12,1,Miri,schoolroom,Rand,sees boy with club coming up behind him,Captain.

One by one, they got the disease, and they became like, Iike those creatures you're afraid of, like Louise. One by one they changed and got the disease. The disease like I've got, like Miri has. You understand what I'm talking about. You're not babies. We can help you!"

Oh, they'll still be here, but not for long, because the food's all gone. You've eaten it. Maybe six months left, that's all, and then nothing left to eat, nobody left to take care of them. They'll die, too."
12,1,Miri,schoolroom,Miri,,"Look at my arm, Jahn. It's happening to me. He's telling the truth."

Now who's doing the hurting? Not the Grups, it's you hurting, yelling, maybe killing, just like the Grups you remember and creatures you're afraid of. You're acting like them, and you're going to be just like them unless you let me help you. I'm a Grup, and I want to help you. I'm begging you, let me help you or there won't be anything left at all. Please."

12,1,Miri,laboratory,Spock,,We must. The vaccine could be fatal.
12,1,Miri,laboratory,Mccoy,,"The disease certainly is. How long do we have left? Hours, minutes? How much longer do you want to wait?"

13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Lenore,,You mean leave? But I've only just arrived.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Narrator,,KIRK; So have I.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Lenore,,And you hate to overstay a welcome.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Kirk,,Exactly.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Lenore,,Why not?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Kirk,,Good. I'll make our apologies to our hostess. I'll meet you outside.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,countryside,,"Meandering between rocks and scrubby trees, arm in arm",
13,1,The Conscience of the King,countryside,Narrator,,KIRK; Tired of walking?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,countryside,Lenore,,No. Just thinking.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,countryside,Kirk,,About what?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,countryside,Lenore,,"At the party, you were such a brash young man."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,countryside,Narrator,,KIRK; And now?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,countryside,Lenore,,"Now somehow different. Not a ship's Captain with all those people to be strong and confident in front of. You know, you're really very dear, aren't you? In some ways, very lonely."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,countryside,,"But just as their lips are about to meet, Kirk spots a body among the rocks and goes to investigate",
13,1,The Conscience of the King,countryside,Kirk,,It's Tom Leighton. He's dead.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,,"Tom's body is laid out on the couch, and Martha covers it",
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Martha,,"At least he has peace now. He never really had that before. Oh, why was Tom killed if what he suspected wasn't true?"
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Kirk,,I don't know. I'll try and find out.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Martha,,"Oh, Jim. How I'll miss him. (bursts into tears and leaves)"
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Uhura,,"Bridge here, Captain."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Kirk,,"Put me through to Captain Jon Daily of the AstraI Queen on orbit station, and put it on scramble."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Uhura,,"Captain Daily's on, sir."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Narrator,,KIRK; Jon? Jim Kirk.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Daily,,"Hi, Jim."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Kirk,,Can you do me a favour?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Daily,,I owe you a dozen. Just ask.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Kirk,,Don't make your pick-up here.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Daily,,You mean strand all those actors?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Kirk,,"I'll pick them up. And if there's any trouble, it'll be my responsibility."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Daily,,Will do. Anything else?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Kirk,,Just keep this between the two of us and accept my thanks. Over and out. Kirk to Enterprise.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Uhura,,"Bridge here, Captain."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,leighton's home,Kirk,,"Transporter room, ready to beam up."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Spock,,"Ready to resume course, Captain."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Kirk,,I think we're due for a pick-up.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Spock,,What kind? Personnel? Cargo?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Uhura,,Captain? A Miss Karidian has been transported aboard ship. She requests permission to see you.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Kirk,,"Tell her to come up to the Bridge, Lieutenant."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,transporter room,Uhura,,Escort Miss Karidian to the Bridge.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Spock,,How did you know this lady was coming aboard?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Kirk,,I'm the Captain.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Lenore,,"Captain Kirk, I didn't think we'd be meeting again so soon."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Kirk,,You probably wouldn't believe me if I told you I arranged it.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Lenore,,"No, but it's a delightful thought. Captain, I'm afraid we need your help. We've been stranded. It seems that our transportation has cancelled out on us."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Kirk,,Can't you make other arrangements?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Lenore,,"Yes, but not in time. You see, our schedule is like a chain. One break and it all collapses."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Kirk,,It'd be a shame if that happened.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Lenore,,If ever we needed a Good Samaritan.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Kirk,,Well.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Lenore,,I appeal to you.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,,Spock's eyebrow hits the ceiling,
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Kirk,,The regulations are very clear about taking on passengers.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Lenore,,"I'll make a bargain with you, Captain."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Kirk,,What have you got to trade?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Lenore,,Special performance for the crew in exchange for a lift.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Kirk,,You make it sound very interesting. The crew has been on patrol for a long time. They could use a break in the monotony.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Lenore,,Then you'll do it?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Kirk,,"You've got me backed into a corner. The men would never forgive me if I deprived them of your performance, and your presence."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Lenore,,"Thank you, Captain. I'm eternally grateful. I'll get the company ready. This means so much to them."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, prepare to leave orbit as soon as the Karidian company is aboard the ship."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,,Lenore and her escort enter the turbolift,
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Spock,,"May I inquire as to our course, Captain?"
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Kirk,,Benecia Colony.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Spock,,Benecia Colony is eight light years off our course.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Kirk,,"If my memory needs refreshing, Mister Spock, I'll ask you for it. In the meantime, follow my orders."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 2818.9. There are many questions in my mind, too many, perhaps, about the actor Karidian and his daughter. For personal reasons, I'm almost afraid to learn the answers."

13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Spock,,"We'll arrive stardate 2825.3, Captain, approximately fifteen hundred Benecia time."

13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Computer,,Data being received. Kodos file of all survivors. There are nine actual eye witnesses who can identify Kodos.

13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Computer,,"Affirmative. Riley, Kevin. Presently assigned U.S.S. Enterprise communications section."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Kirk,,Stop. Mister Spock.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Spock,,Captain.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant Kevin Riley in communications, I wish to have him transferred down to the engineering decks."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Spock,,"He came up from engineering, Captain."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Kirk,,I'm sending him back.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Spock,,Any explanation? He's a fine young officer. He's bound to consider this transfer a disciplinary action.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Kirk,,"I don't wish to discuss it, Mister Spock. Please follow my orders."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Mister Spock, the man on top walks a lonely street. The chain of command is often a noose."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,sickbay,Spock,,"Spare me your philosophical metaphors, Doctor. The Captain is acting strangely. I'm asking if you've noticed."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Negative. Did you know this is the first time in a week I've had time for a drop of the true? Would you care for a drink, Mister Spock?"
13,1,The Conscience of the King,sickbay,Spock,,My father's race was spared the dubious benefits of alcohol.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Now I know why they were conquered. What are you so worried about, anyway? I find Jim generally knows what he's doing."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,sickbay,Kirk,,It was illogical for him to bring those players aboard.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Illogical? Did you get a look at that Juliet? That's a pretty exciting creature. Of course your, personal chemistry would prevent you from seeing that. Did it ever occur to you that he simply might like the girl?"
13,1,The Conscience of the King,sickbay,Spock,,It occurred. I dismissed it.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,sickbay,Mccoy,,You would.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,sickbay,Spock,,Did you know that he suddenly transferred Lieutenant Riley to engineering?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Lots of things go on around here that I don't know, Mister Spock. Now, he's the Captain. He can transfer whoever he pleases. You can look that up in a hundred volumes of space regulations somewhere. All right? Come on, have a drink."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,sickbay,Spock,,"No, thank you."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,sickbay,Mccoy,,"You're welcome. But I will. And please, Mister Spock, if you won't join me, don't disapprove of me. At least not until you've tried it, huh?"
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,,Lenore is getting a personal tour of the ship,
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Kirk,,This is the observation deck. That's the flight deck down there with the shuttle craft.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Lenore,,Interesting.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Kirk,,Isn't it?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Lenore,,"Tell me, Captain Kirk."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Kirk,,Anything.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Lenore,,Did you order the soft lights especially for the occasion?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Kirk,,"If I had ordered soft lights, I'd also have arranged for music and flowers. Unfortunately, it isn't so. On the Enterprise, we try to duplicate earth conditions of night and day as closely as possible."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Lenore,,"Star light, star bright. I wish I may, I wish I might. Do you remember that, Captain?"
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Kirk,,It's very old.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Lenore,,"Almost as old as the stars themselves. And this ship. All this power, surging and throbbing, yet under control. Are you like that, Captain? All this power at your command, yet the decisions that you have to make"
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Kirk,,Come from a very human source.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Lenore,,"Are you, Captain? Human?"
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Kirk,,You can count on it.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Lenore,,"Tell me about the women in your world, Captain."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Kirk,,I'd rather talk about you. You must have wanted to perform since you first saw your father act. When was that?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Lenore,,In the beginning.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Kirk,,Tell me about it.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Lenore,,That's not fair. You haven't answered my question about the women.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Kirk,,What would you like to know?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Lenore,,Has the machine changed them? Made them just people instead of women?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Kirk,,"Worlds may change, galaxies disintegrate, but a woman always remains a woman."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,observation deck,Lenore,,All this and power too. The Caesar of the stars and the Cleopatra to worship him.

13,1,The Conscience of the King,bridge,Computer,,Affirmative.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,corridor,Mccoy,,"I appreciate whatever concern you may have for the ship's company, Mister Spock,"
13,1,The Conscience of the King,corridor,Spock,,"I will continue, Doctor. According to our library banks, it started on the Earth colony of Tarsus Four, when the food supply was attacked by an exotic fungus and largely destroyed. There were over eight thousand colonists and virtually no food. And that was when Governor Kodos seized full power and declared emergency martial law."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,corridor,Mccoy,,I've heard of it.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,corridor,Spock,,"You may not have heard it all. Kodos began to separate the colonists. Some would live, be rationed whatever food was left. The remainder would be immediately put to death. Apparently he had his own theories of eugenics."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,corridor,Mccoy,,"Unfortunately, he wasn't the first."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,corridor,Spock,,"Perhaps not. But he was certainly among the most ruthless, to decide arbitrarily who would survive and who would not, using his own personal standards, and then to implement his decision without mercy. Children watching their parents die. Whole families destroyed. Over four thousand people. They died quickly, without pain, but they died. Relief arrived, but too late to prevent the executions. And Kodos? There never was a positive identification of his body."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,corridor,Mccoy,,What has Karidian to do with it?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,corridor,Spock,,His history begins almost to the day where Kodos disappeared.
13,1,The Conscience of the King,corridor,Mccoy,,You think Jim suspects he's Kodos?
13,1,The Conscience of the King,corridor,Spock,,"He'd better. There were nine eye witnesses who survived the massacre, who'd actually seen Kodos with their own eyes. Jim Kirk was one of them. With the exception of Riley and Captain Kirk, every other eye witness is dead. And my library computer shows that wherever they were, on Earth, on a colony, or aboard ship, the Karidian Company of Players was somewhere near when they died."
13,1,The Conscience of the King,corridor,Mccoy,,It's unbelievable.

14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Uhura,,"All wavelengths dominated by ionisation effects, sir. Transmission is blocked, reception impossible."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Ferris,,"Well, Captain?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"We have until 2823.8 to continue the search, Commissioner."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Ferris,,"You don't really think you'll have any luck, do you?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"Look, these people are my friends and my shipmates. I intend to continue the ship's search for them until the last possible moment."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Ferris,,"Very well, Captain, but not one second beyond that moment. Is that clear? If it isn't, I suggest you look at book nineteen, section four thirty three, paragraph twelve."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"I'm familiar with the regulations, Commissioner. I know all about your authority. Launch shuttlecraft Columbus."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,,Spock is scanning one of it's small nacelles when McCoy comes out to join him.,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,"Well, I can't say much for the circumstances, but at least it's your big chance."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,"My big chance? For what, Doctor?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,"Command. Oh, I know you, Mister Spock. You've never voiced it, but you've always thought that logic was the best basis on which to build command. Am I right?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,"I am a logical man, Doctor."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,It'll take more than logic to get us out of this.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Perhaps, Doctor, but I know of no better way to begin. I realise command does have its fascinations, even under circumstances such as these. But I neither enjoy the idea of command, nor am I frightened of it. It simply exists. And I will do whatever logically needs to be done. Excuse me."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,,he heads back inside,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,"Very bad, Mister Spock."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,In what way?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,"We've lost a great deal of fuel. We have no chance at all to reach escape velocity. And if we ever hope to make orbit, we'll have to lighten our load by at least five hundred pounds."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,The weight of three grown men.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,"Aye, you could put it that way."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,Or the equivalent weight in equipment.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Doctor McCoy, with very few exceptions we use virtually every piece of equipment aboard this craft in attaining orbit. There's very little excess weight, except among the passengers."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,,You mean three of us must stay behind.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Unless the situation changes radically, yes."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,,And who's to choose?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"As commanding officer, the choice will be mine."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,,You wouldn't be interested in drawing lots?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"A very quaint idea, Mister Boma, but I do believe I'm better qualified to make the selection than any random drawing of lots."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,,"All right, Mister Spock. Who?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"My choice will be a logical one, arrived at through logical means."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,"Mister Spock, life and death are seldom logical."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"But attaining a desired goal always is, Doctor. Now gentlemen, I suggest we move outside to make a further examination of the hull in the event we've overlooked any minor damage."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,,Spock leaves,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,,"If any minor damage was overlooked, it was when they put his head together."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,"Not his head, Mister Boma, his heart. His heart."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocky ledge,,"Latimer and Gaetano are investigating a strange scraping sound, but the mist is obscuring their vision.",
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocky ledge,Latimer,,What is it?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocky ledge,Gaetano,,II don't know. It's from up there.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocky ledge,Latimer,,"No, it's from back there."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocky ledge,Gaetano,,It's everywhere. It's all around us!
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocky ledge,Latimer,,Let's get out of here.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocky ledge,,"They go to the top of the ridge, and Latimer stands up. Someone throws a large flint-tipped spear into his back, and he falls. The scream is heard back at the shuttlecraft",
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Come on, Boma."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,,Gaetano fires his phaser at several different enemies. The spear in Latimer's back is taller than a man,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Spock,,What was it?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Gaetano,,"It was something huge, terrible. Up there. I think I hit it."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Boma,,Did you see what it was?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Gaetano,,Vaguely. It was like a giant ape.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Boma,,Poor Latimer.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Gaetano,,At least it was quick for him.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Boma,,We'll get off all right.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Spock,returns from investigating,Nothing there.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Gaetano,,I tell you there was.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Spock,,I don't doubt your word.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Gaetano,,But there must be something. I swear I hit it.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Spock,pulling the bloody spear from Latimer's body and examining it,Folsom Point.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Boma,,Sir?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Spock,,"There's a remarkable resemblance to the Folsom Point discovered in 1925, old world calendar, New Mexico, North America. A bit more crude about the shaft, I believe. Not very efficient."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Boma,,Not very efficient? Is that all you have to say?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Spock,,"Am I in error, Mister Boma?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Boma,,You? Error? Impossible.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Spock,,"Then what, Mister Boma?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Boma,,"There's a man lying there dead, and you talk about stone spears. What about Latimer?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Spock,,"My concern for the dead will not bring him back to life, Mister Boma."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Gaetano,,"Mister Spock. In the interest of efficiency, I don't think we should leave his body here."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Spock,,"Bringing him back to the ship should not interfere with our repair efforts. If you need assistance, I"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Gaetano,,"We'll do it. Give me a hand with Latimer, will you?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bottom of the ledge,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, stardate 2822.3. We continue to search, but I find it more difficult each moment to ward off a sense of utter futility and great loss."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, the Columbus has returned from searching quadrant seven seven nine X by five three four M. Results negative."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,Have them proceed to the next quadrant. Any word from engineering on our sensors?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Uhura,,"They're working on them, sir. Still inoperable."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,What about the transporters?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Uhura,,They're still reported unsafe.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"Thank you, Lieutenant."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Ferris,,Captain.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, Commissioner?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Ferris,,"I don't relish the thought of abandoning your crewmen out there, however I must remind you"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"I haven't forgotten, Commissioner."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Ferris,,You're running out of time.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"I haven't forgotten that, Commissioner. This is the captain. Try using overload power on the transporters. We've got to get them working."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Chief,,"Aye, aye, Captain."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"Uhura, order the Columbus to open its course two degrees on every lap from now on."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Sulu,,"But Captain, two degrees means they'll be overlooking more than a dozen terrestrial miles on each search loop."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"It also means we have a fighting chance to cover the majority of the planet's surface. Mind your helm, Mister Sulu."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Sulu,,"Yes, sir."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Ferris,stepping into the turbolift,"Twenty four more hours, Captain."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,Perhaps if you were to channel the second auxiliary tank through the primary intake valve.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,It's too delicate. It may not be able to take the pressure as it is.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,coming in from rear compartment,"This should save us at least fifty pounds, Mister Spock."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Excellent, Doctor."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mears,,We should be able to scrape up another hundred pounds.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,Which would still leave us at least one hundred and fifty pounds overweight.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,I can't believe you're serious about leaving someone behind. Now whatever it is that's out there
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"It is more rational to sacrifice one life than six, Doctor."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,I'm not talking about rationality.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,You might be wise to start.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,looking in from outside,Mister Spock. we're ready.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,For what?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,,The services for Latimer.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Mister Boma, we're working against time."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,,The man's dead. He deserves a decent burial. You're the captain. A few words.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Doctor, perhaps you know the correct words for such an occasion."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,"Mister Spock, that's your place."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"My place is here. If you please, Doctor."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,"Now look. We may all die here. At least let us die like men, not machines."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"By dealing with first things first, I hope to increase our chances of staying alive. Well, Mister Scott."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,If you'll give me a hand with this conduit.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,,Boma closes the door and leaves them to it,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,,later,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,Pressure's dropping. We're losing everything.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,What happened?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,"One of the lines gave. The strain of coming through the atmosphere and the added load when we tried to bypass. Yes, that's done it. We have no fuel."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"That would seem to solve the problem of who to leave behind. Consider the alternatives, Mister Scott."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,We have no fuel! What alternatives?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Mister Scott, there are always alternatives."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,Mister Spock! Something's happening outside.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,,They crouch down behind a rock while Spock stands and listens to that scraping sound,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,"What do those supersensitive ears make of that, Mister Spock?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,Wood rubbing on some kind of leather.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Gaetano,,They're getting ready. They'll attack.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Boma,,"Not necessarily. It could be a simple tribal rite, assuming a tribal culture."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,Not a tribal culture. Their artefacts are too primitive. More likely a loose association of some sort.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Mears,,If we knew more about them
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Boma,,"We know enough. If they're tribal, they'll have a sense of unity. We can use that."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,"How, Mister Boma?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Boma,,By hitting them hard. Give them a bloody nose. Make them think twice about attacking us.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Gaetano,,"Yes, I agree. If we stand by and do nothing, we're just giving them an invitation to come down and slaughter us."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,I'm frequently appalled by the low regard you Earthmen have for life.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Gaetano,,"Well, we're practical about it. I say we hit them before they hit us."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,Mister Boma?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Boma,,Absolutely.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,Doctor McCoy?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,Seems logical to me.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,"It does, indeed. It seems logical to me, also. But to take life indiscriminately,"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Gaetano,,The majority.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,"I am not interested in the opinion of the majority, Mister Gaetano. Components must be weighed. Our danger to ourselves as well as our duties to other life forms, friendly or not. There's a third course."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Gaetano,,That could get us killed.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,I think not. Doctor McCoy.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,Yes.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,You and Yeoman Mears return to the ship. Assist Mister Scott in any way possible. We'll be back shortly.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,Right.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,,Mears and McCoy leave,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Gentlemen, you'll follow my orders to the letter, firing only when so instructed, and at my designated targets."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Gaetano,,Now you're talking.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,"We'll fire to frighten, Mister Gaetano, not to kill."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Gaetano,,"Oh, for the. You saw what they did to Latimer!"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,"I am in command, Mister Gaetano. The orders and the responsibility will be mine. Follow me."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,,"The trio are paddling through dry ice when a giant spear is thrown across their path. Spock fires at one assailant, who throws his shield at them too. They move on a little way.",
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,Boma,,The mists. I can't see them.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,Spock,,"I hear them. They're directly ahead of us. Several, I believe. Direct your phasers to two o'clock and to ten o'clock."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,Gaetano,,I say we hit them dead on.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,Spock,,"Yes, I know. But fortunately, I'm giving the orders. Take aim please, and fire when I give a signal."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,,"He climbs partway up a rock, for a better view.",
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,Spock,,Fire. (several seconds of sustained phaser beam) Cease fire. (It's gone quiet) They should think twice before bothering us again.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,Gaetano,,I still say we should have killed them.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,Spock,,"It was not necessary. Fear will do for us what needs to be done. Mister Boma, you will return with me to the Galileo. Mister Gaetano, you remain on guard here. Keep in contact with the ship."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,,"Boma says a silent goodbye to his colleague, and the noise starts up again",
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mears,,Did you find them?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Yes, we found them. They won't bother us again."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,I hope not. Scotty has an idea.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,"It's dangerous, but it might work."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Go, Mister Scott."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,I can adjust the main reactor to function with a substitute fuel supply.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"That's all very well, but we don't have a substitute supply."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,"Aye, we do. Our phasers. I can adapt them and use their energy. It'll take time, but it's possible."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,"Trouble is, they happen to be our only defence."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,They would also seem to be our only hope.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,Aye.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,after brief thought,"Yeoman, your phaser."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mears,,But what if the creatures attack again?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"They won't attack for at least several hours. By then, with luck, we'll be gone."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,"If I can get a full load, we should be able to achieve orbit with all hands. Not that we can maintain it long."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"We don't have to maintain it very long, Mister Scott. In less than twenty four hours, the Enterprise will be forced to abandon its search in order to make a rendezvous. If we can't maintain orbit after that time, it won't make any difference. If we burn up in a decaying orbit or die here on the planet's surface, we shall surely die. Doctor, your phaser. Go to work, Mister Scott."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,"Aye, aye, sir."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,transporter room,,A bunch of boxes is beamed aboard,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,transporter room,Chief,,"They came back all right, sir. In my opinion, the transporters are now safe for human transport."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,transporter room,Kirk,,"Good. This is the captain. Landing parties one, two, and three, report to transporter room for immediate beaming down to surface of the planet. Ordinance condition One A."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,transporter room,Chief,,"Captain, it's a big planet. It'll be sheer luck if our landing parties find anything."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,transporter room,Kirk,,"I'm depending on luck, Lieutenant. It's almost the only tool we have that'll work."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,,"Gaetano has worked himself up into a panic when a rock knocks his phaser out of his hand. Then a spear is thrown, and finally the giant creature comes for the helpless man",
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,,"Spock, Boma and McCoy arrive on the scene a little later, and examine the marks in the ground. Spock picks up the dropped phaser",
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,Spock,,"Take this back to Mister Scott for conversion, please Doctor."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,Boma,,"Nobody knows what's happened to Gaetano, and you hand over his phaser like nothing's happened at all."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,Spock,handing over his own phaser,And give this to Mister Scott in the event I don't return.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,Mccoy,,Just where are you going?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,Spock,,"I have a certain scientific curiosity about what's become of Mister Gaetano. Return to the ship, please."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,,Spock leaves,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,Mccoy,,"I don't know. He'll risk his neck locating Gaetano and if he finds him, he's just as liable to order him to stay behind. You tell me."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,Boma,,Do you really think the ship will ever leave?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,Mccoy,,"Well, it won't unless we get these phasers back."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,rocks,,"Further on, Spock finds Gaetano's body draped over a rock. He picks him up in a fireman's lift and heads back to the shuttlecraft with him. Spears are thrown. McCoy and Boma help him get the body inside.",
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,,"Scott is still lying in the middle of the floor, working",
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,"Well, Mister Spock, they didn't stay frightened very long, did they?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,Most illogical reaction. We demonstrated our superior weapons. They should have fled.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,You mean they should have respected us?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,Of course.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,"Mister Spock, respect is a rational process. Did it ever occur to you they might react emotionally, with anger?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Doctor, I am not responsible for their unpredictability."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,"They were perfectly predictable to anyone with feeling. You might as well admit it, Mister Spock, your precious logic brought them down on us."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mears,,Why haven't they done anything?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"They're studying us, for the moment."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,,"Another prediction, Mister Spock?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"My opinion, Mister Boma."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,,The shuttlecraft shakes as one of the locals starts battering it with a rock,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,Seal the windows!
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,"Studying us, Mister Spock? They seem to learn rather quickly."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,,"All right, Spock, you have all the answers. What now?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Mister Boma, your tone is increasingly hostile."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,,"My tone isn't the only thing that's hostile, Mister Spock!"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,Curious. Most illogical.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,,I'm sick and tired of your logic!
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mears,,We could use a little inspiration.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Strange. Step by step, I have made the correct and logical decisions. And yet two men have died."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,And you've brought our furry friends down on us.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"I do seem to have miscalculated regarding them, and inculcated resentment on your parts. The sum of the parts cannot be greater than the whole."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Narrator,,"MCCOY A little less analysis and more action. That's what we need, Mister Spock."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"How much longer, Mister Scott?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,"Another hour, maybe two."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,That won't be long enough.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,"Doctor, a phaser can only drain so fast."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,,How long do you think those plates will hold out under this? We've got to do something!

14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, stardate 2823.1. Our landing parties are on the surface of Taurus Two. We continue to hope. Instruments are slowly returning to an operable condition as the ion storm slowly disperses. On the ship, we can only wait helplessly."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,What word from the sensor section?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Uhura,,At last report they were getting some readings
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,I'm not interested in the last report. I want to know now.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Ferris,,"You have two hours and forty three minutes, Captain."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,I'm perfectly aware of how much time I have left.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Ferris,,I'm delighted. However I shall continue to remind you.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,You do that.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Uhura,,"Sir, sensor section reporting. Static interference still creating false images. Estimates eighty percent undependable."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,What about radio communication?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Uhura,,Clearing slowly. Still incapable of transmission or reception.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Ferris,,What do you intend to do?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"Do? I intend to continue the search. Foot by foot, inch by inch, by candlelight if necessary, until the last possible moment. And if you'd keep your nose off my bridge, I'd be thankful."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Ferris,,"I'm sure the authorities will be pleased by your diligence, Captain. I'm not sure they'll appreciate the way you address a High Commissioner."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"I'm in command here, Mister Ferris."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Ferris,,"You are, Captain. For another two hours and forty two minutes."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Mister Scott, how much power do we have left in the ship's batteries?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,"They're in good shape, but they won't lift us off, if that's what you're getting at."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,Will they electrify the exterior of this ship?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,"That they will, Mister Spock!"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,,He dashes to the rear compartment and puts on big rubber gloves,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Get to the centre of the ship. Don't touch the plates. Be sure you're insulated. Stand by. Are you ready, Scott?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,"Ready, Mister Spock."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,All right. Go. (Scott uses a spanner or something to short out the battery connections) Again! Again!
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,,It goes quiet and still outside,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,I daren't use any more. Not and be sure of ignition.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,I believe we've used enough. Mister Scott. I suggest you continue draining the phasers.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,Aye.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,It must've worked.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,For the moment.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,,For the moment?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"The moment they discover they're not seriously hurt, they'll be back. Meanwhile, please check the aft compartment. See if there's anything you can unload to lighten the ship."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,,Mister Gaetano's body's back there.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,It will of course have to be left behind.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,,Not without a burial.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,I wouldn't recommend it. The creatures won't be far away.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,,"Not without a burial, Mister Spock."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,It would expose members of this crew to unnecessary peril.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,,"I'll take that chance. You see, Mister Spock, I would insist upon a decent burial even if your body was back there."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,Mister Boma.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Boma,,I'm sick and tired of this machine!
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,That's enough!
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Gentlemen. All right, Mister Boma, you'll have your burial, provided the creatures will permit it."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain Kirk, landing party number two has been beamed back aboard ship. They have casualties. One dead, two injured."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,going to Spock's station,Put Lieutenant Kelowitz on visual.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kelowitz,,"Kelowitz, Captain."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,,His uniform is dirty and he sounds tired,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,Report.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kelowitz,,"We were attacked, Captain. Huge, furry creatures. I checked with astral anthropology, and they're order 480G, anthropoid. Similar to life forms discovered on Hansen's Planet, but much larger. Ten, twelve feet in height."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,There are casualties?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kelowitz,,"Ensign O'Neal got a spear through the body before we even knew they were around. Lieutenant lmmamura has a dislocated shoulder and severe lacerations, but he'll make it all right. Captain, the creatures are all over the place. If the Galileo is down on that planet, I"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"Thank you, Lieutenant. You'd better report to Sickbay yourself."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kelowitz,,"Aye, aye, Captain."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,,Commissioner Ferris enters,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Ferris,,"Captain Kirk, check your chronometer. You'll see that it is 2823.8. Your time is up."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,But they're still out there.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Ferris,,"So are the plague victims on New Paris. I'm sorry, Captain. I now assume authority granted me under Title fifteen, Galactic Emergency Procedures, and I order you to abandon search."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,The Columbus hasn't returned yet. I still have two search parties out.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Ferris,,"You're procrastinating, Captain. You have your orders. Recall your search parties and proceed to Makus Three immediately."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,Lieutenant.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,Order the transporter room to immediately beam up the two search parties from the surface. Attempt to contact the Columbus.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Uhura,,"I'm in partial contact with them now, sir."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"Then have them return immediately. Mister Sulu, prepare to abandon search. Set course for Makus Three."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's log, supplement. The search parties have returned to the ship, and the Columbus is on its way back. I have been compelled to abandon the search."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, the sensor section says the beams are working again."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,What about the other systems?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Uhura,,"No, sir. Too much interference."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, course set for Makus Three."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"Stand ready, Mister Sulu. How long before the Columbus comes on board?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Uhura,,"Twenty three minutes, sir."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,Twenty three minutes.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mears,,"Enterprise, this is Galileo. Come in, please. Enterprise. Nothing, sir. Just ionic interference."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,That's it.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,How about weight?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,"If we shed every ounce, we might be able to achieve orbit."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,And how long can we hold it?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,"A few hours, no longer. But if we time it right, we can cut out of orbit and save enough fuel for a controlled re=entry."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,To land here again? Not a very attractive possibility.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,"We have very few alternatives, Mister Spock."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Doctor McCoy. Mister Boma. When can we lift off, Scott?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,Maybe eight minutes if the weight's right.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,,McCoy appears from the aft compartment,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Gentlemen, The ship will lift off in exactly ten minutes. You have that long to bury Mister Gaetano. Now, it appears to be clear outside, at least for the moment. I'll assist you. Hurry."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Uhura,,"The Columbus is aboard, sir. The flight hatch is closed. Transporter room reports last of the landing parties have beamed safely up. All systems report secured for warp factors."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Sulu, proceed on course for Makus Three, at space normal speed."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Sulu,,"Space normal, sir?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"Those are my orders. Lieutenant Uhura, order all sensor sections to direct beams aft. Full function, continuous operation until further orders."

14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Spock,,"Get us off, Scott!"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Scott,,"We should be moving, but we're not."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Spock,,"Quite right, Mister Scott. There's somebody holding us down. All systems are go, but we're not moving."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,,Throws switches on the pilot's panel,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Scott,,What are you doing?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Spock,,Our boosters.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Scott,,We'll never be able to hold orbit.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Spock,,Would you rather stay here?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Scott,,"No, Mister Spock."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,,They swap seats,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Mears,,We're moving!
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Boma,,They let go!
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Mccoy,,We got off!
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Spock,,"May I remind you we have yet to achieve orbit, nor can we maintain it long. An hour from now we may be right back where we started from."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,,The Galileo leaves the sickly yellow and green atmosphere of the planet,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Spock,,"Gentlemen, by coming after me, you may well have destroyed what slim chance you had for survival. The logical thing for you to have done was to have left me behind."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Mccoy,,"Mister Spock, remind me to tell you that I'm sick and tired of your logic."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Spock,,"That is a most illogical attitude. Orbit in one minute, Mister Scott. Fuel status?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Scott,,"Fifteen pounds psi. Approximately enough for one orbit, sir."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Mccoy,,After that?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Scott,,Tapping our boosters ended our last chance for a soft landing.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Boma,,You mean a burn-up?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Spock,,It is the usual end of a decaying orbit.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Mears,,I don't want to die up here.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Spock,,"Infinitely preferable to the kind of death we'd be granted on the planet's surface, I should think."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Boma,,I admire your ability to make so measured a choice.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Scott,,"Mister Spock, you said a while ago that there were always alternatives."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Spock,,Did l? I may have been mistaken.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, at least I lived long enough to hear that. Is there anything we can do?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Spock,,The Enterprise is surely on course for Makus Three by now. I for one do not believe in angels.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, Mister Spock, so ends your first command."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Spock,,Yes. My first command.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Scott,,"Orbit attitude, Mister Spock. With our present fuel, that gives us about forty five minutes."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Spock,,"Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise, come in, please. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,,"He ponders for a moment, then flicks the Fuel Jettison button",

14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Mears,,What happened?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Scott,,He jettisoned the fuel and ignited it.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Boma,,We need that fuel to maintain orbit. Are you out of your mind?
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Spock,,"Perhaps, Mister Boma."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Mccoy,,"How long have we got now, Scotty?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Scott,,The orbit'll start decaying as soon as the fuel's exhausted. Say six minutes.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,,The air is full of pointless status reports over the comm. when suddenly,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, there's something there on screen, at Taurus Two."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,,"On the viewscreen, a long trail of yellow crosses the green of the planet",
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"Sensors, a meteorite?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Sulu,,"No. It's holding a lateral line. There it is again. Holding steady, Captain."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"A hundred and eighty degrees about, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant Uhura, contact transporter room. All beams ready. Full normal speed."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,"A distress signal? It's like sending up a flare. Mister Spock, that was a good gamble. Perhaps it was worth it."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,No one out there to see it.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,,The plume of flame fades out,
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Scott,,"Orbit decaying, Mister Spock. Ten seconds to atmosphere."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,"It may be the last action you'll ever take, Mister Spock, but it was all human."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Spock,,Totally illogical. There was no chance.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,That's exactly what I mean.

14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,Mister Spock.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Spock,,Captain.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"There's really something I don't understand about all of this. Maybe you can explain it to me. Logically, of course. When you jettisoned the fuel and ignited it, you knew there was virtually no chance of it being seen, yet you did it anyhow. That would seem to me to be an act of desperation."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Spock,,"Quite correct, Captain."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"Now we all know, and I'm sure the doctor will agree with me, that desperation is a highly emotional state of mind. How does your well-known logic explain that?"
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Spock,,"Quite simply, Captain. I examined the problem from all angles, and it was plainly hopeless. Logic informed me that under the circumstances, the only possible action would have to be one of desperation. Logical decision, logically arrived at."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,I see. You mean you reasoned that it was time for an emotional outburst.
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Spock,,"Well, I wouldn't put it in exactly those terms, Captain, but those are essentially the facts."
14,1,The Galileo Seven,bridge,Kirk,,"You're not going to admit that for the first time in your life, you committed a purely human emotional act?"

He had just checked in with me from the pod when we hit the leading edge of the storm. Not too bad at first. I signalled a Yellow Alert. Then we began encountering pressure, variant stress, force seven, the works. I finally signaled a Red Alert. Finney knew he had a matter of seconds. I gave him those seconds and more. But apparently it wasn't enough."
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Stone,,"Then why, Captain, does the computer log from your ship, made automatically at the time, indicate that you were still on Yellow Alert when you jettisoned and not on Red?"
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Kirk,,I don't know. There's been a mistake.
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Stone,,It would seem so. Could the computer be wrong?
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Kirk,,"Mister Spock is running a survey right now, but the odds are next to impossible."
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Stone,,"Stop recording. Now, look, Jim. Not one man in a million could do what you and I have done. Command a starship. A hundred decisions a day, hundreds of lives staked on you making every one of them right. You're played out, Jim. Exhausted."
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Kirk,,Is that the way you see it?
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Stone,,That's the way my report'll read if you co-operate.
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Kirk,,A physical breakdown. Possibly even mental collapse.
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Stone,,Possibly.
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Kirk,,I'd be admitting a man died because
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Stone,,"Admit nothing. Say nothing. Let me bury the matter here and now. No starship captain has ever stood trial before, and I don't want you to be the first. KIRK: But if what you suspect is true, then I'm guilty. I should be punished."
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Stone,,I'm thinking of the service. I won't have it smeared.
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Kirk,,"By what, Commodore Stone?"
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Stone,,"All right. By an evident perjurer who's either covering his bad judgment, his cowardice, or"
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Kirk,,"That's as far as you go, sir. I'm telling you I was there on the Bridge. I know what happened. I know what I did."
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Stone,,"It's in the transcript, and computer transcripts don't lie. I'm telling you, Captain, either you accept a permanent ground assignment, or the whole disciplinary weight of Starfleet command is going to light right on your neck."
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Kirk,,"So that's the way we do it now? Sweep it under the rug, and me along with it? Not on your life. I intend to fight."
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Stone,,Then you draw a general court.
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Kirk,,"Draw it? I demand it. And right now, Commodore Stone. Right now."
15,1,Court Martial,stone's office,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, Stardate 2948.9. The officers who will comprise my court-martial board are proceeding to Starbase Eleven. Meanwhile, repairs on the Enterprise are almost complete."
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,,"Kirk goes to the table of the lady in green, and kisses her hands.",
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Kirk,,"Areel. Doctor McCoy said you were here. I should have felt it in the air, like static electricity."
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Shaw,,Flattery will get you everywhere.
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Narrator,,"KIRK; It's been, how long has it been?"
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Shaw,,"Four years, seven months, and an odd number of days. Not that I'm counting."
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Kirk,,You look marvellous. You haven't changed a bit.
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Shaw,,"But things have changed for you, haven't they?"
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Kirk,,"Oh, you've heard about that, have you?"
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Shaw,,"I'm a lawyer in the Judge Advocate's office, remember?"
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Kirk,,I remember. Let's forget it. We have a lot of lost time to make up for.
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Shaw,,You're taking it very lightly.
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Kirk,,The confidence of an innocent man.
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Shaw,,Are you? That's not what the rumours indicate.
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Kirk,,"Look, Let's not talk shop."
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Shaw,,"Jim, this could ruin you. Will you take some advice?"
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Kirk,,I never could talk you into anything. All right. Fire away.
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Shaw,,"The prosecution will build its case on the basis of Kirk versus the computer. Now if your attorney tries to defend on that basis, you won't have a chance."
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Kirk,,What other choice is there?
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Shaw,,"That's up to your attorney, and that's why he's got to be a good one."
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Kirk,,"You, perhaps?"
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Shaw,,"No, I'm busy."
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Kirk,,"Well, a girl with your ability should be able to handle two cases at once."
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Shaw,,"Jim, be serious. You're not an ordinary human. You're a Starship Captain, and you've stepped into scandal. If there's any way they can do it, they'll slap you down hard and permanently for the good of the service."
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Kirk,,You still haven't made any recommendation.
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Shaw,,"Samuel T. Cogley, attorney at law. If anyone can save you, he can. He'll be paying you a visit. Jim, I've got to go."
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Kirk,,"Areel, you still haven't told me how you know so much about what the prosecution's going to do."
15,1,Court Martial,starbase club,Shaw,,"Because, Jim Kirk, my dear old love, I am the prosecution, and I have to do my very best to have you slapped down hard. Broken out of the service, in disgrace."
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,,Kirk is about to pour himself a drink.,
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Cogley,,You Kirk?
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Kirk,,Yes. (Notices the piles of books everywhere) What is all this?
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Cogley,,"I figure we'll be spending some time together, so I moved in."
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Kirk,,I hope I'm not crowding you.
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Cogley,,What's the matter? Don't you like books?
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Kirk,,"Oh, I like them fine, but a computer takes less space."
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Cogley,,"A computer, huh? I got one of these in my office. Contains all the precedents. The synthesis of all the great legal decisions written throughout time. I never use it."
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Kirk,,Why not?
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Cogley,,"I've got my own system. Books, young man, books. Thousands of them. If time wasn't so important, I'd show you something. My library. Thousands of books."
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Kirk,,And what would be the point?
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Cogley,,"This is where the law is. Not in that homogenised, pasteurised, synthesiser. Do you want to know the law, the ancient concepts in their own language, Learn the intent of the men who wrote them, from Moses to the tribunal of Alpha 3? Books."
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Kirk,,"You have to be either an obsessive crackpot who's escaped from his keeper or Samuel T. Cogley, attorney at law."
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Cogley,,Right on both counts. Need a lawyer?
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Kirk,,I'm afraid so.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,,"There are four officers in dress uniform on the bench, including Stone.",
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Stone,,"This court is now in session. I have appointed as members of this court Space Command Representative Lindstrom, Starship Captains Krasnovsky and Chandra. Captain Kirk, I direct your attention to the fact that you have a right to ask for substitute officers if you feel that any of these named harbour any prejudiced attitudes to your case."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Kirk,,"I have no objections, sir."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Stone,,Do you consent to the service Lieutenant Shaw as prosecuting officer and to myself as president of the court?
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Kirk,,"I do, sir."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Stone,,"All right, clerk."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Computer,,"Charge, culpable negligence. Specification in that on Stardate 2945.7, by such negligence, Captain Kirk, James T., did cause loss of life, to wit, the life of Records Officer Lieutenant Commander Finney, Benjamin. To all recorded charges and specifications, what is the plea?"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Kirk,,Not guilty.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Stone,,"Proceed, Lieutenant."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,I call Mister Spock.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,,"Spock hands over his data chip, sits down and puts his hand on the lie detector.",

15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"Mister Spock, as a First officer, you know a great deal about computers, don't you?"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Spock,,I know all about them.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"It is possible for a computer to malfunction, is it not?"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Spock,,Affirmative.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,Do you know of any malfunction which has caused an inaccuracy in the Enterprise computer?
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Spock,,Negative.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"That answer is based on your mechanical survey of the Enterprise computer ordered by the defendant prior to this trial, is it not?"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Spock,,Affirmative.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,Now the stardate
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Spock,,"But the computer is inaccurate, never the less."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,Why do you say that?
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Spock,,It reports that the jettison button was pressed before the Red Alert.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"In other words, it reports that Captain Kirk was reacting to an extreme emergency that did not then exist."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Spock,,And that is impossible.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,Is it? Were you watching him the exact moment he pressed the jettison button?
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Spock,,"No, I was occupied. The ship was already on Yellow Alert."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,Then how can you dispute the finding of the log?
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Spock,,I do not dispute it. I merely state that it is wrong.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,Oh? On what do you base that statement?
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Spock,,I know the Captain. He is in
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,Please instruct the witness not to speculate.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Spock,,"Lieutenant, I am half Vulcanian. Vulcanians do not speculate. I speak from pure logic. If I let go of a hammer on a planet that has a positive gravity, I need not see it fall to know that it has in fact fallen."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,I do not see what that has to
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Spock,,"Gentlemen, human beings have characteristics just as inanimate objects do. It is impossible for Captain Kirk to act out of panic or malice. It is not his nature."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,In your opinion.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Spock,,Yes. In my opinion.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"Thank you. Your witness, Mister Cogley."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Cogley,,No questions.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Stone,,You may step down.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,I now call the personnel officer for the Enterprise.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Computer,,"Service rank, Ensign. Position, personnel officer. Current assignment, USS Enterprise."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"In the course of your duties as personnel officer of the Enterprise, you would be familiar with the service records of all aboard?"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Ensign,A young Asian woman,"Yes, ma'am."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"With reference to Records Officer Finney, was there in his service record a reported disciplinary action for failure to close a circuit?"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Ensign,,"Yes, ma'am."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,Was the charge in that instance based upon a log entry by the officer who relieved him?
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Ensign,,"Yes, ma'am."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,And who was that officer?
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Ensign,,Ensign James T. Kirk.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"Louder, please, for the court."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Ensign,,Ensign James T. Kirk.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,Now the Captain Kirk who sits in this courtroom?
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Ensign,,"Yes, ma'am."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"Thank you. Do you wish to cross-examine, Mister Cogley?"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Cogley,,No questions.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Stone,,You may step down.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,I now call Doctor McCoy to the stand.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Computer,,"Service rank, Lieutenant Commander. Position, Ship's Surgeon. Current assignment, USS Enterprise. Commendations, Legion of Honour. Awards of valour. Decorated by Starfleet surgeons."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"Doctor, you are, on the record, an expert in psychology, especially space psychology. Patterns which develop in the close quarters of a ship during long voyages in deep space."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Mccoy,,I know something about it.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"You have just heard the testimony of your own personnel officer, that it was an action of the then Ensign Kirk, which placed an unerasable blot on the record of the then Lieutenant Finney. Psychologically, Doctor, is it possible that Lieutenant Finney blamed Kirk for the incident?"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Mccoy,,It's possible.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"He could have hated Kirk down through the years, blamed him for being passed over for promotion, blamed him for never being given a command of his own, correct?"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Mccoy,,He could have.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"Now, let us hypothesise, Doctor. Is it normal for a person to return affection for hatred?"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Mccoy,,No.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,Do we not tend to at first resent and then actively dislike the person who hates us?
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Mccoy,,Wait a minute. I don't quite follow you.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,Hypothetically. Would not Captain Smith begin to hate Lieutenant Commander Jones once he learned that Lieutenant Commander Jones hated and detested him?
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Mccoy,,"Well, yes, I suppose it could happen."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"Then I ask you, is it not possible that Captain Kirk became aware of Lieutenant Commander Finney's hatred toward him and perhaps, even involuntarily, began to reciprocate?"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Mccoy,,Not Captain Kirk.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"Any normal human, Doctor. Is it possible?"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Mccoy,,But he's not that kind of a man.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"Is it theoretically possible, Doctor?"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Mccoy,,Yes. It's possible.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"Thank you. Your witness, Mister Cogley."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Cogley,,No questions.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Stone,,"You may step down. Mister Cogley. You've listened to testimony from three witnesses, and in neither instance have you availed yourself of your right to cross-examine. Have you abrogated that right?"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Cogley,,"Well, sir, the truth is, I've been holding back till we get this preliminary business out of the way. I'd like to call Captain Kirk to the stand."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Computer,,"James T. Kirk, serial number SC937-0176CEC. Service rank, Captain. Position, Starship command. Current assignment, USS Enterprise. Commendations, Palm Leaf Of Axanar Peace Mission, Grankite Order of Tactics, Class of Excellence, Prantares Ribbon of Commendation, Classes first and second"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,May it please the court.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Stone,,Court recognises counsel for the prosecution.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,The prosecution concedes the inestimable record of Captain Kirk.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Stone,,Mister Cogley?
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Cogley,,"I wouldn't want to slow the wheels of progress. But then on the other hand, I wouldn't want those wheels to run over my client in their unbridled haste."

15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Computer,,"Awards of valour, Medal of Honour, Silver Palm with Cluster, Starfleet citation for Conspicuous Gallantry, Karagite Order of Heroism"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Cogley,,Stop. I think that's enough. I wouldn't want to slow things up too much.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,Thank you.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Cogley,,"Now, Captain, despite what these machines indicate, was there indeed a Red Alert before you jettisoned the pod?"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Kirk,,"Yes, sir, there was."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Cogley,,Please tell us about it.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Kirk,,"Firstly, I am at a loss to explain the errors in the extract from the computer log. We were in an ion storm. Everyone here in this court knows the dangers involved. I was in command. The decisions were mine, no one else's. Charges of malice have been raised. There was no malice. Lieutenant Commander Finney was a member of my crew, and that's exactly the way he was treated. It has been suggested that I panicked on the bridge and jettisoned the ion pod prematurely. That is not so. You've heard some of the details of my record. This was not my first crisis. It was one of many. During it, I did what my experience and training required me to do. I took the proper steps in the proper order. I did exactly what had to be done, exactly when it should have been done."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Cogley,,"You did the right thing, but would you do it again?"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Kirk,,"Given the same circumstances I would do the same thing without hesitation, because the steps I took in the order I took them were absolutely necessary if I were to save my ship. And nothing is more important than my ship."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Cogley,,"Your witness, Miss Shaw."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"The prosecution does not wish to dishonour this man, but facts are facts. I must invite the attention of the court and Captain Kirk to this visual extract from the Enterprise computer log. Play back. What you are about to see is precisely what took place on the Enterprise bridge during the ion storm."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,,On the courtroom viewscreen,
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Uhura,,"Meteorology reports ion storm upcoming, Captain."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Kirk,,We'll need somebody in the pod for readings.
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Spock,,"Mister Finney is top of duty roster, Captain."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Kirk,,Post him.
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Spock,,"Attention, Commander Finney, report to pod for reading on ion plates."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Finney,,Message Received.
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Spock,,"Officer posted, Captain."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,,The ship suddenly judders,
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Kirk,,"Stand by on alert status, Mister Spock."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Spock,,Acknowledged.
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Hanson,,"Approaching ion storm, sir."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Kirk,,"Warp factor one, Mister Hanson."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Hanson,,"Warp one, sir."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,,"There's another sharp jerk, and Kirk presses a button on his chair panel.",
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"Reverse. Stop. Go forward with magnification on the panel. Freeze that. Captain Kirk is now signalling a Yellow Alert. Go forward, normal view."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,,On courtroom viewscreen.,

15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Kirk,,Tie in.
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Finney,,"Finney here, Captain. Ion readings in progress."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Kirk,,"Make it fast, Ben. I may have to go to Red Alert."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Finney,,Affirmative.
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Kirk,,"Hold our course, Mister Hanson."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Hanson,,"Aye, aye, sir. Natural vibrations, force two, Captain. Force three."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Kirk,,"Engineering, then ion pod."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, aye, sir."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Crewman,,Engineering.
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Kirk,,One third more thrust.

15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Finney,,"Aye, aye, sir."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Hanson,,"Force five, sir."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Kirk,,"Steady as she goes, Mister Hanson."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,,And the close up on the Captain's panel shows...,
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"Freeze that! If the court will notice, the log plainly shows the defendant's finger pressing the jettison button. The condition signal reads Yellow Alert. Not red alert, but simply Yellow Alert. When the pod containing Lieutenant Commander Finney was jettisoned, the emergency did not as yet exist."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Kirk,,But that's not the way it happened.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, Stardate 2949.9. The evidence presented by the visual playback to my general court-martial was damning. I suspect even my attorney has begun to doubt me."
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Cogley,,Computers don't lie.
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Kirk,,Are you suggesting that I did?
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Cogley,,"I'm suggesting that maybe you did have a lapse. It was possible, you know, with the strain you were under. There's still time to change our plea. I could get you off."
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Kirk,,"Two days ago, I would've staked anything on my judgment."
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Cogley,,You did. Your professional career.
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Kirk,,I spent my whole life training for decisions just like that one. My whole life. Is it possible that when the moment came? No. I know what I did. You can pull out if you want to.
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Cogley,,"There's no place to go, except back to court and hear the verdict."
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,,Communicator beeps,

15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Spock,,Captain.
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Spock,,I've run a complete megalyte survey on the computer.
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Kirk,,"I'll tell you what you found. Nothing, right?"
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Spock,,"You sound bitter, Captain."
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Kirk,,Not bitter enough to forget to thank you for your efforts.
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Spock,,Further instructions?
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Kirk,,"No. It's not all bad, Mister Spock. Who knows. You may be able to beat your next captain at chess. Kirk out."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Spock,,Chess.
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,,The door opens,
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Kirk,,Jamie. This is Lieutenant Commander Finney's daughter.
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Jamie,,"Mister Cogley, we've got to stop this. Make him take a ground assignment. I realise it wasn't his fault. I won't make any trouble. Make him change his plea."
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Kirk,,"It's too late for that, Jamie, but I'm glad you don't blame me anymore for what happened."
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Jamie,,I was just so upset that night. I'm sorry.
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Kirk,,Don't say any more.
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Jamie,,"But I have to. I never realised how close you and Dad had been until I read through some papers he wrote, letters to Mother and me. I don't know how I ever could've thought that you. Mister Cogley, ruining Jim won't change what's happened."
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Cogley,,"That's very commendable, Miss Finney, but most unusual. After all, Captain Kirk is accused of causing your father's death, and the evidence would indicate his guilt."
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Jamie,,I was just thinking of Jim.
15,1,Court Martial,kirk's room,Kirk,,"I know, and I thank you. I have to go and change. You ready?"

15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Spock,,That is true.
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Mister Spock, you're the most cold-blooded man I've ever known."
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Spock,,"Why, thank you, Doctor. I've just won my fourth game."
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Mccoy,,That's impossible.
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Spock,,Observe for yourself. Rook to king's pawn four.
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Computer,,"Bishop, half level right."
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Spock,,"Now, this is the computer's move. And now mine. (takes the bishop) Checkmate. Mechanically, the computer's flawless. Therefore, logically, its report of the captain's guilt is infallible. I could not accept that, however."
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Mccoy,,So you tested the programme bank.
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Spock,,Exactly. I programmed it myself for chess some months ago. The best I should have been able to attain was a draw.
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Well, why are you just sitting there?"
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Spock,,"Transporter room, stand by. We're beaming down."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Stone,,Court is now in session. The board will entertain motions before delivering its verdict. Counsel for the prosecution?
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"Sir, the prosecution rests."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Stone,,Counsel for the defence?
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Cogley,,"Sir, the defence rests."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,,McCoy and Spock run in and whisper to Kirk and Cogley,
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Stone,,Mister Cogley. Mister Cogley!
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Cogley,,"Sir, some new evidence has just been brought to my attention. I'd like to ask the court to"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,Objection! Counsel for the defence has rested his case.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Stone,,Of what nature is this evidence?
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Cogley,,"I can't tell you, I'll have to show you."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,Mister Cogley is well-known for his theatrics.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Cogley,,Is saving an innocent man's career a theatric? i
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Stone,,Counsels will kindly direct their remarks to the bench.
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Cogley,,"I'd be delighted to, sir, now that I've got something human to talk about. Rights, sir, human rights. The Bible, the Code of Hammurabi and of Justinian, Magna Carta, the Constitution of the United States, Fundamental Declarations of the Martian colonies, the Statutes of Alpha Three. Gentlemen, these documents all speak of rights. Rights of the accused to a trial by his peers, to be represented by counsel, the rights of cross-examination, but most importantly, the right to be confronted by the witnesses against him, a right to which my client has been denied."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"Your Honour, that is ridiculous. We produced the witnesses in court. My learned opponent had the opportunity to see them, cross-examine them."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Cogley,,"All but one. The most devastating witness against my client is not a human being. It's a machine, an information system. The computer log of the Enterprise. Can ask this court adjourn and reconvene aboard that vessel."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Shaw,,"I protest, Your Honour."
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Cogley,,"And I repeat, I speak of rights. A machine has none. A man must. My client has the right to face his accuser, and if you do not grant him that right, you have brought us down to the level of the machine. Indeed, you have elevated that machine above us. I ask that my motion be granted, and more than that, gentlemen. In the name of humanity, fading in the shadow of the machine, I demand it. I demand it!"
15,1,Court Martial,courtroom,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, Stardate 2950.1. After due consideration, the general court-martial has reconvened on board the Enterprise."
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Cogley,,"How many games of chess did you win from the computer, Mister Spock?"
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Spock,,Five in all.
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Cogley,,May that be considered unusual?
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Spock,,Affirmative.
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Cogley,,Why?
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Spock,,"I personally programmed the computer for chess months ago. I gave the machine an understanding of the game equal to my own. The computer cannot make an error and assuming that I do not either, the best that could normally be hoped for would be stalemate after stalemate, and yet I beat the machine five times. Someone, either accidentally or deliberately, adjusted the programming and therefore the memory banks of that computer."
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Cogley,,Could that have had an effect on the visual playback we saw?
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Shaw,,Object! The witness would be making a conclusion.
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Stone,,Sustained.
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Cogley,,"Hypothetically, Mister Spock. Hypothetically, Miss Shaw. If what you suggest had been done, it would be beyond the capabilities of most men. Is that true?"
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Spock,,Affirmative.
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Cogley,,What man aboard ship would it not be beyond?
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Spock,,"The Captain, myself, and the records officer."
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Cogley,,"And at the moment, you have no records officer."
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Spock,,"Affirmative. Until he was lost, our records officer was Lieutenant Commander Finney."
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Cogley,,"Captain Kirk, will you tell the steps you took to find Mister Finney after the storm?"
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Kirk,,I instituted a phase one search.
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Cogley,,Describe a phase one search.
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Kirk,,"It's a painstaking, thorough attempt in and around the ship to find a man who's presumably injured and unable to respond."
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Cogley,,"It presupposes, does it not, that a man wishes to be found?"
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Kirk,,I beg your pardon?
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Cogley,,"If you start a search for a man, you assume, don't you, that he wants to be found? He's not hiding?"
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Kirk,,Yes.
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Cogley,,"On a ship of this size, could a man evade such a search?"
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Kirk,,Possibly.
15,1,Court Martial,briefing room,Cogley,,"Gentlemen, I submit to you that Lieutenant Commander Ben Finney is not dead."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Stone,,"Mister Cogley, we are waiting for proof of the extraordinary statement you made in the briefing room."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Cogley,,"You shall have it, but first I need the co-operation of this court in conducting an experiment. Captain Kirk."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Kirk,,"Gentlemen, for the purposes of this experiment, it'll be necessary for all personnel, except for members of the court and the command crew, to leave the ship. I am ordering all others to report to the transporter room."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Cogley,,"Including myself, sir."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Stone,,"This court is by no means adjourned, Mister Cogley."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Cogley,,"I have an errand ashore of vital importance to the purpose of this court, and I will return."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Stone,,Very well.
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Cogley,,"Thank you, sir."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,,Leaves with the spare crew members.,
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Stone,,"Captain, are you maintaining an engine crew aboard?"
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Kirk,,Our impulse engines have been shut down. We'll maintain orbit by momentum.
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Krasnovsky,,And when the orbit decays?
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Kirk,,We hope to be finished long before that.
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,,A little later,
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Kirk,,"Ready, Mister Spock?"
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Spock,,"Affirmative, Captain."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Kirk,,"Gentlemen, this computer has an auditory sensor. It can, in effect, hear sounds. By installing a booster, we can increase that capability on the order of one to the fourth power. The computer should bring us every sound occurring on the ship."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Crewman,,"All personnel have left the ship as ordered, sir."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Kirk,,"Doctor McCoy? All right, Mister Spock."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,,A cacophony of heartbeats comes over the bridge speakers.,
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Kirk,,"Turn it down a little. Gentlemen, that sound is caused by the heartbeats of all the people on board the ship. Doctor McCoy will use this white sound device to mask out each person's heartbeat so that it will be eliminated from the sounds we are hearing."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Mccoy,,"First, the Captain. Mister Spock."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,,He goes around the assembled group one at a time,
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Mccoy,,"And lastly, myself."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Kirk,,"That's all of us, except for crewman in the transporter room. Mister Spock, eliminate his heartbeat. That accounts for everyone."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,,But still one heart beats over the speakers.,
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Stone,,Finney.

15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Spock,,Acknowledged.
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Stone,,So Finney is alive.

15,1,Court Martial,corridor,,"Armed with a phaser, Kirk makes his way alone.",
15,1,Court Martial,corridor,Kirk,,Sam Cogley had gone a shore to bring Jamie Finney on board. We felt Jamie's presence would make Finney easier to handle in the event Finney really were alive.

15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Stone,,The orbit is beginning to decay.
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Kirk,,"Ben, where are you?"
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Finney,,"Hello, Captain!"
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Finney,,Nothing to say
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Finney,,Captain?
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Kirk,,I'm glad you're alive.
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Finney,,"You mean you're relieved because you think your career is saved. Well, you're wrong."
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Kirk,,"Ben! Ben, it's not too late. We can help you."
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Finney,,Like you helped me all along? Kept me down
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Finney,,Robbed me of my own command?
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Finney,,"I'm a good officer, as good as you. I've watched you for years. The great Captain Kirk."
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,,"We finally see the man, as he jabs a phaser into Kirk's back",
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Finney,,"They told you to do it to me. You all conspired against me. You ruined me, but you won't do it anymore."
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,,He disarms Kirk and throws the weapon away. Kirk turns to face him.,
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Kirk,,"Put the phaser down, Ben."
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Finney,,"Oh, I wouldn't kill you, Captain. Your own death would mean too little to you, But your ship"
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Kirk,,What about my ship?
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Finney,,It's dead. I've killed it. I tapped out your primary energy circuits.
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, what's our orbit status?"
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Spock,,"Decaying, Captain."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Hanson,,Variants at second level
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Hanson,,Depreciating unusually fast.
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Finney,,"You're out of power. I know the ship, too. The Enterprise should've been mine. You kept me from it."
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Kirk,,Ben. Why kill innocent people?
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Finney,,"Innocent? Officers and gentlemen, Captains all. Except for Finney and his one mistake. A long time ago, but they don't forget."
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Kirk,,"I logged the mistake, Ben. Blame me, not them."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Finney,,But they are to blame. All of them.
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Finney,,I was a good officer. I really was. I loved the service more than any man ever dared.
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Hanson,,"Mister Spock, we're running out of time."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Spock,,"Gentlemen, if you'll please hurry to the transporter room"
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Stone,,"Mister Spock, the court has not yet reached a verdict. We will hear this witness out."
15,1,Court Martial,bridge,Spock,,"Very well, sir."
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Kirk,,It's not too late. You can be helped. But if you kill those people
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Finney,,"Why shouldn't I? They killed me, didn't they? It's a fair trade."
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Kirk,,Is Jamie included in that deal?
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Finney,,What do you mean?
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Kirk,,She's on board by now. Yes. She's on board.
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,Finney,,What? Why did you do that? Why did you bring her here? I'll kill you!
15,1,Court Martial,engineering,,"Kirk takes his opportunity to grapple with the bigger man. There's a fight in which Kirk's shirt gets torn. Finney swings at Kirk with a wrench, but finally has his lights punched out.",

16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",starbase computer centre,Spock,,This is Mister Spock.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,"The ship's computers will handle the helm on this voyage, Mister Hansen. Course will be computed and set automatically."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",starbase computer centre,Spock,,You will not discuss this with ship's crew or starbase personnel. Do you read?
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Hansen,,"Acknowledged, sir."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",starbase computer centre,Spock,,Stand by. We'll warp out of orbit in one hour.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Kirk,watching Pike on monitor,He keeps blinking no. No to what?
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Mccoy,,They've tried questioning him. He's almost agitated himself into a coma.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Kirk,,How long will he live?
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Mccoy,,"As long as any of us. Blast medicine anyway. We've learned to tie into every human organ in the body except one. The brain. The brain is what life is all about. Now, that man can think any thought that we can, and love, hope, dream as much as we can, but he can't reach out, and no one can reach in."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Kirk,,He keeps blinking no.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Mccoy,,"No to what? They could question him for days, weeks, before they stumble on the right thing."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Kirk,,"Bones, could this have anything to do with Spock?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Mccoy,,"I don't read you at all, Jim."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Kirk,,"What I mean is either a message was received. It was one of two things. Either someone sent a message diverting us here, or someone on board the ship lied about receiving it. Could that someone be Mister Spock?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Mccoy,,"Jim, forgetting how well we both know Spock, the simple fact that he's a Vulcan means he's incapable of telling a lie."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Kirk,,He's also half human.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Mccoy,,And that half is completely submerged. To be caught acting like us or even thinking like us would completely embarrass him.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Kirk,,"Someone's interfering with my command and my ship. I don't know who it is, but I mean to find out. Even you. If I thought you had the technical know-how I'd suspect you, but you don't. Spock does."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Mccoy,,He would not make a false entry.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Kirk,,There's a false entry in the log right now which doesn't jibe with the established facts. How do you explain that.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Mccoy,,"I can't, but to question Spock of all people? Me, yes. I could run off half-cocked given a good reason. So could you, but not Spock. It's impossible."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Voice,,"Doctor McCoy, report to Transporter Control. Doctor McCoy to Transporter Control."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Mccoy,,McCoy here.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Voice,,"You're needed aboard the Enterprise, Doctor. Medical emergency."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Mccoy,,"Well, what is it? Sickness? Injury? How bad is it?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Voice,,"That's all we have on it, Doctor. Just needed aboard."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Mccoy,,"Probably somebody discovered a hangnail. I'll beam up and let you know, Jim."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Kirk,reading,For eyes of Starfleet Command only.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Mendez,,"Oh, I'm certifying I ordered you to read it. Know anything at all about this planet?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Kirk,,"What every ship Captain knows. General Order 7, no vessel under any condition, emergency or otherwise, is to visit Talos Four."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Mendez,,And to do so is the only death penalty left on our books. Only Fleet Command knows why. Not even this file explains that. (unlocks the magnetic strip) But it does name the only Earth ship that ever visited the planet.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Kirk,,"The Enterprise, commanded by Captain Christopher Pike."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Mendez,,With a half Vulcan science officer named Spock.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Piper,,"Commodore! Captain Pike, he's gone!"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Mendez,,Mendez here. What is it?
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",mendez' office,Voice,,"Starship Enterprise, Commodore. It's warping out of orbit. Refuses to acknowledge our signal."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Hansen,,"Out of orbit, Mister Spock. Seems strange with no navigator on duty."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,"The Enterprise knows where she's going, Mister Hansen."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Uhura,,"Someone's trying to hail us, sir."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,"Maintain radio silence, Lieutenant. This is First Officer Spock. Per Starfleet orders this date, I have been placed in temporary command of the Enterprise. While our destination is secret, our mission is relatively simple. Starbase Command has assigned Captain Kirk medical rest leave until our return. His instructions are that you will obey my orders as you would his. First Officer out."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Mccoy,,What's going on around here? Who said Jim needed a medical rest leave? And this call about me being needed aboard the ship. I've checked everywhere.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,And no one from the ship made such a call.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Mccoy,,That's right.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,"Doctor, I regret they elected to keep certain things from you. Will you come with me, please."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Mccoy,,"What is this, Spock? Captain, are you all right? (flash, flash) I see that you're still signaling"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Spock,,"Doctor, one moment, please."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Kirk,,"Kirk to Doctor McCoy. I'm recording you this message, Bones, so there will be no misunderstanding. I'm sorry to have to make it an order. You're not to disturb Captain Pike with any questions. Simply take good care of him. Follow Spock's instructions to the letter. Kirk out. (flash, flash)"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Hansen,,"Sir, scanners report an object following us, about the size of a starbase shuttlecraft. Shall we reverse helm?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,"Take no action, Mister Hansen."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Hansen,,"But at our speed, they'll never catch us. In case they want to reach us"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,"You have your orders, Mister Hansen. We'll make no contact."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",shuttlecraft,Mendez,,"Starbase Shuttlecraft one to Enterprise. Come in, please. Enterprise, Commodore Mendez and Captain Kirk. If you read me, you are ordered to reply. Repeating it on all emergency frequencies, Jim."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",shuttlecraft,Kirk,,"Spock is headed for Talos Four, all right."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",shuttlecraft,Mendez,,"Pulling ahead of us fast. Fuel is down to sixty three point three. If we turn back now, we've just got barely enough to get us back to the base."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",shuttlecraft,Kirk,,"Shuttlecraft to Enterprise, come in. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise, come in. Enterprise, come in!"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Computer,,Library computer.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,Lock on to sensors. Measure object now following the Enterprise.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Computer,,"Computed. Object is a Class F shuttlecraft. Duranium metal shell, ion engine power"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,Stop. How long before shuttlecraft's fuel supply forces return to starbase?
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Computer,,Computed. Shuttlecraft is already past point of safe return.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",shuttlecraft,Mendez,,We coast.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",shuttlecraft,Kirk,,Blast you any way. You had no right to come along.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",shuttlecraft,Mendez,,"RHIP, Captain. Rank hath its privileges."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",shuttlecraft,Kirk,,Two hours of oxygen left.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",shuttlecraft,Mendez,,Wonderful.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",shuttlecraft,Kirk,,"Part of me is hoping the Enterprise won't come back for us. We step on that deck, Spock is finished. Court-martialed, disgraced."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",shuttlecraft,Mendez,,He's dead if he makes it to Talos Four. Why would he want to get Pike there? The command reports stated Talos contained absolutely no practical benefits to mankind.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",shuttlecraft,Kirk,,Spock would have some logical reason for going there.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",shuttlecraft,Mendez,,Maybe. Maybe he's just gone mad.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Mccoy,,"I keep wondering who might be after us in a shuttlecraft and I keep coming up with the same answers, but I can't be right, can l, Mister Spock."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,Computer control. Lock on to shuttlecraft following us.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Computer,,Locked on. Tractor beam ready.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,Go to tape Abel Seven Baker. Execute instructions.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Mccoy,,"Is it the captain, Mister Spock?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Hansen,,"Sir, the engines are reversing. She's brought herself to a dead stop."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,"This is the First Officer speaking. Security, send an armed team to the Bridge. Transporter Room, stand by to beam Captain Kirk aboard. Effective until then, Lieutenant Hansen is in operational command."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Hansen,,Sir?
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,"First Officer out. Doctor, as senior officer present, I present myself to you for arrest."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Mccoy,,You what?
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,"The charge is mutiny, Doctor. I never received orders to take command."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Security,,"Security reporting, Mister Spock."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,Doctor.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Mccoy,,"Mister Spock is, er, under arrest. Is confinement to quarters enough?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,"Adequate, Doctor. I'll make no trouble."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, confine him."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Security,,"Yes, sir."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",transporter room,Kirk,,"Store our shuttlecraft on the hangar deck, Mister Scott. Beam us directly aboard."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",transporter room,Scott,,"All right, Captain. Locked on to you."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",transporter room,Hansen,,"Transferring command to you, sir."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",transporter room,Kirk,,Accepting command. Where's Mister Spock?
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",transporter room,Hansen,,"In his quarters, under arrest."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",transporter room,Mendez,,"His quarters, after what he's done, Lieutenant?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",transporter room,Uhura,,Captain from Bridge. The engines are coming on.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",transporter room,Kirk,,Reverse power. Hold this position. Tell whoever gave those orders to report
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",transporter room,Hansen,,"Sir, there's nobody up there giving orders. Mister Spock has the computers running the ship."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",transporter room,Kirk,,"Disengage computer control, Uhura."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",transporter room,Uhura,,"We can't disengage, Captain. The helm does not respond. (Scott leaves, muttering in Gaelic)"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",transporter room,Kirk,,"Computer control, come in."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",transporter room,Computer,,Computer.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",transporter room,Kirk,,Disengage from helm.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",transporter room,Computer,,Unable to comply.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",spock's quarters,Kirk,,"This is the Captain. On voice command, you will override all contrary instructions. Voice command, disengage from helm."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",spock's quarters,Computer,,Unable to comply. Any such attempt will cross-circuit vessel's life-supporting system. Computer control cannot be disengaged until vessel reaches planet Talos Four.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",spock's quarters,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 3012.4. Despite our best efforts to disengage computers, the Enterprise is still locked on a heading for the mysterious planet Talos Four. Meanwhile, as required by Starfleet General Orders, a preliminary hearing on Lieutenant Commander Spock is being convened. And in all the years of my service, this is the most painful moment I've ever faced."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Kirk,,"This hearing is convened. Mister Spock, you're aware of your right to counsel of your choice?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Spock,,"Sir, I waive counsel. Further, I waive rights to this hearing and request immediate court-martial."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Kirk,,Request denied.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Spock,,"May I inquire on what grounds, Captain?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Kirk,,A mutiny requires a trial board of no less than three command officers. Since there are only two of that rank available
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Spock,,"Sir, I must point out that there are three officers of command rank available. Yourself, Commodore Mendez, and Captain Christopher Pike."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Kirk,,Denied. Captain Pike is a complete invalid.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Spock,,I believe you'll find he's still on the active duty list.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Mendez,,"We didn't have the heart to retire him, Jim. He's got you. Whatever he's up to, he's planned it well."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 3012.6. General Court-Martial convened. Mister Spock has again waived counsel and has entered a plea of guilty."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Mendez,,"Mister Spock, are you aware in pleading guilty that a further charge involving the death penalty must be held against you should this vessel enter the Talos star group?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Spock,,I am.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Mendez,,Why? What does it accomplish to go there or to take Captain Pike there? I want to know why.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Spock,,"Are your comments a part of the record, sir?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Mendez,,"Yes, it's on the record."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Spock,,Thank you. Request monitor screen be engaged.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Mendez,,For what purpose?
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Spock,,"To comply with the request you just made, sir, that I explain the importance of going to Talos Four."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Kirk,,"By asking why, you've opened the door to any evidence he may wish to present. Apparently what he had in mind."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Mendez,,Present your evidence. Screen on.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Spock,,"This is thirteen years ago. The Enterprise and its commander, Captain Christopher Pike."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Spock,,"Definitely something out there, Captain, headed this way."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Kirk,,"Screen off. Chris, was that really you on the screen? (flash) That's impossible. Mister Spock, no vessel makes record tapes in that detail, that perfect. What were we watching?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Spock,,"I cannot tell you at this time, sir."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Mendez,,"Captain Pike, were any record tapes of this nature made during your voyage? (flash, flash) The court is not obliged to view evidence without knowing its source."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Spock,,"Unless the court asks a prisoner why, Commodore. You did ask that question."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Mendez,,You mean I was maneuvered into asking. Your evidence is out of order.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Kirk,,"I am forced to contest that, Commodore. I want to see more."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Mendez,,"You have that right, Captain, but just because the prisoner is your First Officer and your personal friend"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Kirk,,That has nothing to do with it.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Mendez,,"Very well, continue."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Kirk,,"Screen on, Mister Scott."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Number One,,No. It's something else. There's still something out there.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Spock,,"As I stated, gentlemen, this was thirteen years ago. We were on routine patrol when the ship's sensors detected something ahead. At first we were not certain what it was."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Tyler,,It's coming at the speed of light. Collision course.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Tyler,,"The meteorite beam has not deflected it, Captain."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Number One,,"Evasive manoeuvres, sir?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Pike,,Steady as we go.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Comm Officer,,"It's a radio wave, sir. We're passing through an old-style distress signal."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Pike,,They were keyed to cause interference and attract attention this way.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Comm Officer,,"A ship in trouble making a forced landing, sir. That's it. No other message."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Tyler,,I have a fix. It comes from the Talos star group.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Number One,,We've no ships or Earth colonies that far out.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,Their call letters check with a survey expedition. S.S. Columbia disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Tyler,,It would take that long for a radio beam to travel from there to here.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,"Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar system similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class M, oxygen atmosphere."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Number One,,"Then they could still be alive, even after eighteen years."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Pike,,If they survived the crash.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Spock,,"We aren't going to go, to be certain?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Pike,,"Not without any indication of survivors, no. Continue to the Vega Colony and take care of our own sick and injured first. You have the helm. Maintain present course."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Number One,,"Yes, sir."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Boyce,,Boyce here.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Pike,,"Drop by my cabin, Doctor. (Boyce enters with bag) What's that? I didn't say there's anything wrong with me."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Boyce,,I understand we picked up a distress signal.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Pike,,"That's right. Unless we get anything more positive on it, it seems to me the condition of our own crew takes precedent. I'd like to log the ship's doctor's opinion, too."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Boyce,,"Oh, I concur with yours, definitely."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Pike,,"Good. I'm glad you do, because we're going to stop first at the Vega Colony and replace anybody who needs hospitalisation and also. What the devil are you putting in there, ice?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Boyce,,Who wants a warm martini?
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Pike,,What makes you think I need one?
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Boyce,,"Sometimes a man will tell his bartender things he'll never tell his doctor. What's been on your mind, Chris, the fight on Rigel seven?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Pike,,"Shouldn't it be? My own yeoman and two others dead, seven injured."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Boyce,,Was there anything you personally could have done to prevent it?
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Pike,,"Oh, I should have smelled trouble when I saw the swords and the armour. Instead of that, I let myself get trapped in that deserted fortress and attacked by one of their warriors."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Boyce,,"Chris, you set standards for yourself no one could meet. You treat everyone on board like a human being except yourself, and now you're tired and you"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Pike,,"You bet I'm tired. You bet. I'm tired of being responsible for two hundred and three lives. I'm tired of deciding which mission is too risky and which isn't, and who's going on the landing party and who doesn't, and who lives and who dies. Boy, I've had it, Phil."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Boyce,,"To the point of finally taking my advice, a rest leave?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Pike,,To the point of considering resigning.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Boyce,,And do what?
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Pike,,"Well, for one thing, go home. Nice little town with fifty miles of park land around it. Remember I told you I had two horses, and we used to take some food and ride out all day."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Boyce,,"Ah, that sounds exciting. Ride out with a picnic lunch every day."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Pike,,I said that's one place I might go. I might go into business on Regulus or on the Orion colony.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Boyce,,"You, an Orion trader, dealing in green animal women, slaves?"
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Pike,,The point is this isn't the only life available. There's a whole galaxy of things to choose from.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Boyce,,"Not for you. A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets it head-on, and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Pike,,"Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Boyce,,Take your choice. We both get the same two kinds of customers. The living and the dying.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",pike's quarters,Spock,,"Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up message, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Officer,reads,"Eleven survivors from crash. Gravity and oxygen within limits. Food and water obtainable, but unless. The message faded at that point, sir."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Pike,,Address intercraft.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Tyler,,System open.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",bridge,Pike,,This is the captain. Our destination is the Talos star group.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Pike,,"Our time warp, factor seven."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Tyler,,Course computed and on the screen.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Number One,,"All decks have acknowledged, sir."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Pike,,Engage.
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Mendez,,"Screen off. Mister Spock, I'm truly amazed at your technical prowess in somehow manufacturing all this. I congratulate you on your imagination. But this is a court of space law, not a theatre."
16,1,"The Menagerie, part 1",hearing room,Spock,,"Captain, please tell the court this is not imagination, nor some clever photographic record. Are we seeing the actual events of thirteen years ago? (flash) Yes, gentlemen. On that screen as it happened, the incredible experience of Captain Christopher Pike on Talos Four. If, after witnessing this, the court wishes to turn this vessel back, I will release this ship to manual control."

17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Mccoy,,Did you find Mister Sulu?
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,"No, but I'm sure he's all right."

17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Rodriquez,,"I like them fine, sir, but all our surveys showed"
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Narrator,,KIRK; Then offhand I'd say our instruments are defective. There are indeed life-forms on this planet.
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Rodriquez,,"Sir, our surveys couldn't have been that wrong."

17,1,Shore Leave,woodland path,Tonia,,"That's just it. It's almost too beautiful. I was thinking, even before my tunic was torn, that in a place like this a girl should be, oh let's see now, a girl should be dressed like a fairy-tale princess, with lots of floaty stuff and a tall hat with a veil."
17,1,Shore Leave,woodland path,Mccoy,,"I see what you mean, but then you'd have whole armies of Don Juans to fight off. And me, too."

17,1,Shore Leave,woodland path,Tonia,,"All right, but you stay right there. Don't peek."
17,1,Shore Leave,woodland path,Mccoy,,"My dear girl, I am a doctor. When I peek, it's in the line of duty."

17,1,Shore Leave,bridge,Spock,,That sounds like a painful reality.
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,Yes.
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Spock,,There must be some logical explanation.

17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,I hope he got through to everybody. Communications are almost out.
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Sulu,,That's not all. So's my phaser.
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,,Kirk checks his own weapon - nothing) KIRK: Yeah. We'd better get to the glade,
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Sulu,,"Yes, sir. (sound of a transporter beam) Look. Someone beaming down from the bridge."
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,"Trying to. Something's obstructing it. (finally the familiar shape fully materialises) Mister Spock, my orders were no one was to leave the ship."
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Spock,,"Necessary, Captain. Unable to contact you by communicator, and the transporter is useless to us now. As I told you before, there's an unusual power field down here. It's soaking up all the energy at the source. I calculated the rate of its growth, and reasoned that I just might be able to transport one more person."
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,Good. We can use your help.

17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Kirk,,Yeoman! We're in trouble. I need every crewman alert and thinking.

17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Sulu,at the knight's body,Captain! Captain!
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,,Kirk goes over,
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Sulu,,"You'd better have a look at this, sir. (the knight is a plastic dummy) I don't understand."
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Kirk,,"Neither do I, Mister Sulu, but before we leave this planet, I will."
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Sulu,,"It's like a dummy, Captain. It couldn't be alive."
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Kirk,,Tricorder?
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Sulu,,"Still operating, sir."
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Kirk,,"Mister Spock. (Spock and Sulu swap places, handing over the tricorder) What do you make of that?"
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Spock,,"This is not human skin tissue, Captain. It more closely resembles the cellular casting we use for wound repairs. Much finer, of course."
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Kirk,,"I want an exact judgment, Mister Spock."
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Spock,,"This is definitely a mechanical contrivance. It has the same basic cell structure as the plants here, even the trees, the grass."
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Kirk,,"Are you saying this is a plant, Mister Spock?"
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Spock,,"I'm saying that these are all multicellular castings. The plants, the animals, the people. They're all being manufactured."
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Kirk,,By who? And why? And why these particular things?
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Spock,,All we know for certain is that they act exactly like the real thing. Just as pleasant or just as deadly.

17,1,Shore Leave,woodland path,Teller,,What is it?
17,1,Shore Leave,woodland path,Rodriguez,,"Of all the crazy things. Remember what I was telling you a while ago, about the early wars and funny air vehicles they used? That's one of them."
17,1,Shore Leave,woodland path,Teller,,Can it hurt us?
17,1,Shore Leave,woodland path,Rodriguez,,Not unless it makes a strafing run.
17,1,Shore Leave,woodland path,Teller,,A what?

17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Kirk,,Spock?
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Spock,,"At this point, Captain, my analysis may not sound very scientific."
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Kirk,,McCoy's death is a scientific fact.
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Spock,,"There is one slight possibility, very slim, but nevertheless. Captain, what were your thoughts just before you encountered the people you described?"

17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Finnegan,,Here I am! Run!
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Finnegan,,"Jim! Find me! Can't you see me? Come and get me! Here I am! Come on. You never could find your head with both hands! Like it used to be, Jimmy. Remember? (finally Kirk catches up to him, because he's lounging on a ledge) Hey, Jim"
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,I want some answers.
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Finnegan,,Coming up.
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,,He jumps on Kirk and they have a fight. Finnegan knocks Kirk down,
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Finnegan,,"Get up. Get up. Get up. Always fight fair, don't you? True officer and gentleman, you. You stupid underclassman. I've got the edge. I'm still twenty years old. Look at you. You're an old man."
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,,"The fight resumes, and Kirk punches Finnegan till he falls down a rocky slope and ends up writhing in pain",
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Finnegan,,I can't move me leg. I can't feel me leg. My back is broken. You've broken me back.
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,Can you feel that?
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,,He gets kicked to the ground,
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Finnegan,,"Can you feel that, now? (Kirk passes out) Sleep sweet, Jimmy boy. Sleep as long as you like. Sleep forever, Jim boy. Forever and forever."
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,,"A little later, Kirk regains consciousness",
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Finnegan,,"Won't you ever learn, Jim boy? You never could take me, you know."
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,Finnegan. One thing
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Finnegan,,Sure. Name it.
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,Answers.
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Finnegan,,Earn them!
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,,He throws dirt in Kirk's face and the exchange of punches resumes until they're both too tired to continue.,
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Finnegan,,"Not bad. Kind of makes up for things, huh, Jim?"
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,A lot of things. What's been happening to my people?
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Finnegan,,"I never answer questions from plebes, Jimmy boy."
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,"I'm not a plebe. This is today, fifteen years later. What are you doing here?"
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Finnegan,,"I'm being exactly what you expect me to be, Jimmy boy."
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,,Kirk lands the final haymaker that knocks Finnegan out cold,
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Spock,,"Did you enjoy it, Captain?"
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,"Yes, I enjoyed it. After all these years. (realisation dawns) I did enjoy it. The one thing I wanted to do after all these years was to beat the tar out of Finnegan."
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Spock,,Which supports a theory I've been formulating.
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,That we're all meeting people and things that we happen to be thinking about at the moment.
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Spock,,"Yes. Somehow our thoughts are read, these things are quickly manufactured and provided for us."
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,Dangerous if we happen to be thinking about
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Spock,,Yes. We must all control our thoughts.
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,Difficult.
17,1,Shore Leave,rocky outcrop,Spock,,"The force field we encountered is obviously underground, manufacturing these things. Passages lead to the surface. Just for example, when Rodriguez thought of a tiger"

17,1,Shore Leave,glade,,A smiling grey-haired man in a long green robe walks up to Kirk,
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Kirk,,Who are you?
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Caretaker,,"I'm the caretaker of this place, Captain Kirk."
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Kirk,,You know my name?
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Caretaker,,"But of course. Lieutenant Rodriguez, Lieutenant Sulu, Yeoman Barrows and Mister Spock. We've just discovered you don't understand all this. These experiences were intended to amuse you."
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Kirk,,Amuse? That's your word for what we've been through?
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Caretaker,,"But none of this is permanent. Here you have to only imagine your fondest wishes, either old ones you wish to relive or new ones, anything at all. Battle, fear, love, triumph. Anything that pleases you can be made to happen."
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Spock,,The term is amusement park.
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Caretaker,,Of course.
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Spock,,An old Earth name for a place where people could go to see and do all sorts of fascinating things.
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Caretaker,,This entire planet was constructed for our race of people to come and play.
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Sulu,,"Play? As advanced as you obviously are, and you still play?"
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Kirk,,"Yes, play, Mister Sulu. The more complex the mind, the greater the need for the simplicity of play."
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Caretaker,,"Exactly, Captain. How very perceptive of you."
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Kirk,,But that still doesn't explain the death of my ship's surgeon.
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Mccoy,,"Possibly because no one has died, Jim. (Strolls in with a lovely girl on each arm) I was taken below the surface for some rather remarkable repairs. It's amazing. They've got a factory complex down there you wouldn't believe. They can build or do anything immediately."
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Tonia,not amused,And how do you explain them?
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Mccoy,,"Oh. Them. Well I, er, I was thinking about a little cabaret I know on Rigel Two, and, er, there were these two girls in the chorus line. And well, here they are. Well after all, I am on shore leave."
17,1,Shore Leave,glade,Tonia,,And so am l.

18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,"The precise meaning of the word desert is a waterless, barren wasteland. I fail to understand your romantic nostalgia for such a place."

18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Desalle,,"No, sir. Forward sweeps are negative. Wait. Verified, sir. We must be in some sort of light warp or we'd have picked it up earlier."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,Put it on visual.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,,A purple globe appears on the viewscreen,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Desalle,,"Iron-silica body, planet sized, magnitude one E. We'll be passing close."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,Inconceivable this body has gone unnoted on all our records.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,"And yet, here it is. No time to investigate. Science stations, gather data for computer banks. Uhura, notify the discovery on subspace radio."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Uhura,,"Strong interference on subspace, Captain. The planet must be a natural radio source."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,"Let's get out of its range. Veer forty degrees to starboard, Mister Sulu."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Sulu,,Forty degrees.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,,"He reaches for the switch, and sways as if dizzy, then stands up and vanishes",
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,Sulu!
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,,"He dashes to Sulu's station, then suddenly stops and disappears too",
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Desalle,,"Mister Spock, they're gone!"

18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Narrator,,"Ship's log Stardate 2124.5. First Officer Spock reporting for Captain James Kirk. We are orbiting the lone unrecorded planet in the star desert. For four hours, we have made every possible instrument sweep, but Captain Kirk and Helmsman Sulu remain unaccounted for. I have placed the ship on red alert."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,,Enterprise is now orbiting a red planet with white whispy clouds,

18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,"Function is normal. Continuous sensor sweeps. Lieutenant Uhura, have you checked all wave bands?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Uhura,,"All of them, Mister Spock. No response."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Desalle,,"With due respect, sir. Request permission to transport to the surface immediately and carry out a search."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Mccoy,,I second DeSalle's request. What are we waiting for?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,"The decision will be mine, Doctor. I have the responsibility for your safety. (to Sulu's replacement) Mister Jaeger, describe your geophysical findings for the surface below."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Jaeger,,"No detectable soil or vegetation. Extremely hot, toxic atmosphere swept by tornadic storm. Continuous volcanic eruptions. Deadly to any lifeforms such as we know it without oxygen and life-support systems."

18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,"Greetings and felicitations. Hmm. Send this, Lieutenant. USS Enterprise to signaler on planet surface. Identify self."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,,The reply comes up on the monitor,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,Hip hip hoorah? And I believe it's pronounced tally ho.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Desalle,,"Some kind of a joke, sir?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,"I'll entertain any theories, Mister DeSalle. Any at all."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Mccoy,,One thing is certain. Obviously there's life on that planet.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,"You're quite correct, Doctor. Prepare transporter room."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Scott,,"Request assignment to the search party, sir."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,"No, Mister Scott. Neither you nor I can be spared here. Mister DeSalle, equip the landing party with full communications, armament, and life-support gear. Mister Jaeger, your geophysical knowledge may be crucial down there. Doctor McCoy will accompany. If those peculiar signals are coming from Captain Kirk or Lieutenant Sulu, their rationality is in question. Dismissed."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,transporter room,Uhura,,"No more messages from below, sir, but I've locked onto their original source."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,transporter room,Spock,,"Very good. Transmit coordinates to Mister Scott. Once on the planet's surface, you'll establish contact with us immediately. Use the laser beacon if necessary. Ready, Scott?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,transporter room,Scott,,"Ready, Mister Spock."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,transporter room,Spock,,Activate.

18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,Sulu and Kirk are displayed in a mini-minstrel's gallery. McCoy scans them.,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Mccoy,,There's no reading. They're like waxworks figures.

18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"I must say, they make a perfectly exquisite display pair, but I suppose you want them back now."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,He waves his hand and the two men come back to life,

18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,Welcome to an island of peace on my stormy little planet of Gothos.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,What happened? Fill me in.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Mccoy,,You disappeared from the bridge after Sulu. We've been looking for you for four hours.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"You must excuse my whimsical way of fetching you here, but when I saw you passing by I simply could not resist."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Starship Enterprise.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Ah, so you're the Captain of these brave lads. My greetings and felicitations, Captain. So good of you and your officers to drop in. Absolutely smashing."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,Who are you? Where do you come from?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Narrator,,"General Trelane, retired. At your service, sirs. My home is your home."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,He goes back to his playing,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Desalle,,"We've lost contact with the ship, Captain. We're trapped here."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"I can't tell you how delighted I am to have visitors from the very planet that I've made my hobby. Yes, but according to my observations, I didn't think you capable of such voyages."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Jaeger,,"Notice the period, Captain. Nine hundred light years from Earth. It's what might be seen through a viewing scope if it were powerful enough."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Ah, yes. I've been looking in on the doings on your lively little Earth."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,Then you've been looking in on the doings nine hundred years past.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Oh, really? Have I made an error in time? How fallible of me. Oh, I did so want to make you feel at home. I'm quite proud of the detail."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,General Trelane.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Retired, sir. Just Squire Trelane now. And you may call me Squire. Yes, I rather fancy that."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,For what purpose have you imprisoned us here?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Imprisoned? Nonsense. You're my guests. You see, I just finished my studies of your curious and fascinating society. You came by at the most propitious moment. I want to know all about your campaigns, your battles, your missions of conquest."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"Our missions are peaceful, not for conquest. When we do battle, it is only because we have no choice."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Ah, but that's the official story, eh?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,I must ask you to let us go back to our ship.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,I wouldn't hear of it. You shall join me in a repast. I want to learn all about your feelings on war and killing and conquest. That sort of thing. Do you know that you're one of the few predator species that preys even on itself?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,"Kirk returns to the main group, where DeSalle has his hand on his phaser",
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"Not yet. Put it on stun, not to kill, DeSalle."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"DeSalle, did you say? Un vrai Francais?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Desalle,,"My ancestry is French, yes."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Ah, monsieur. Vive la gloire. Vive Napoleon. You know, I admire your Napoleon very much."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"This is Mister DeSalle, our navigator. Doctor McCoy, our medical officer. Mister Sulu, our helmsman, and Carl Jaeger, meteorologist."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Welcome, good physicianer and honourable sir. (bows low)"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Sulu,,Is he kidding?

18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Jaeger,,"I'm a scientist, not a military man."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,Oh come now. We're all military men under the skin. And how we do love our uniforms.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,"Trelane is admiring himself in his mirror when he spots DeSalle raising his weapon, and with a wave of the hand, stops him",
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,What an interesting weapon you've got there. Do let me see it.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,"He takes it out of DeSalle's hand, and he can move again",
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Narrator,,"TRELANE:: Yes. Now let me see. How does this work? Ah, yes. This won't kill, and this will."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,"He fires it at the Salt Monster, who is disintegrated",
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Oh, how marvellous! (destroys another exhibit) Devastating! Why, this could kill millions."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,Kirk takes it off him,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"Who will you start with, my crew? Are we your next targets?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Oh, how absolutely typical of your species. You don't understand something, so you become fearful. Now, do let me anticipate your next question. You want to know how I've managed all of this."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,That's correct.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"We, meaning I and others, have, to state the matter briefly, perfected a system by which matter can be transferred to energy and back to matter again."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,Like the transporter system aboard the Enterprise.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Oh, a crude example of an infinitely more sophisticated process. You see, we not only transport matter from place to place, but we can alter its shape at will."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"This drawing room, did you create it by rearranging matter on this planet?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,Quite.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,I see. How did you manage
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Dear Captain, your inquiries are becoming tiresome. I want you to be happy. Free yourself of care. Let's enjoy ourselves in the spirit of martial good fellowship."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"Come on, let's go. We're getting out of here."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Tut, tut, tut. You're being quite rude. You can't go. Apparently, you need another demonstration of my authority. Yes, quite."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,"Kirk vanishes from the room and is in the natural atmosphere of the planet, choking on the fumes. Everyone in the room can hear him. Trelane brings him back) Now, that's a sample of the atmosphere of this planet outside my kindly influence. Now, you will behave yourself hereafter, won't you? Or I shall be very, very angry",

We have completed fourteenth orbit of this planet without establishing contact with our missing officers or the parties sent to find them. Subspace communications remain blocked. However, by diverting impulse power to our sensors, we have made them operable, and we have detected one small area on the surface which seems relatively stable."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, it's there, Mister Spock. Peaceful as Earth, but how do you explain it?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,"I don't, Mister Scott. It simply exists. Artificial perhaps, or a freak of nature. The fact remains that life can exist in that area."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, it could, but it couldn't move around much."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,Apply a fine tuning on our sensors. Locate any life forms in that stable area.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Scott,,"If we find any, it doesn't follow that it would be our people."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,"Affirmative. But if the Captain is down there and alive, that's where he'll have to be. We'll attempt to transport up any living beings our sensors detect."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Scott,,"Shooting in the dark, Mister Spock?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,"Or stand by and do nothing, Mister Scott."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,Trelane is showing off his decor,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Narrator,,"And this, of course, is an array of your battle flags and pennants dating back to the Crusades, to Hannibal's invaders, the Grecian war galleys, and the hordes of Persia. Can't you imagine it, Captain? The thousands of men marching off to their deaths, singing beneath these banners. Doesn't it make your blood run swiftly?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,Then he goes back to his music,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Sulu,,"Captain, where could he possibly come from? Who is this maniac?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Mccoy,,"Better say, what is he? I monitored him, and what I found was unbelievable."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,Not alive?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Mccoy,,Not in the way we define life. No trace. Zero.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Sulu,,"You mean, it shows he's dead?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Mccoy,,"It doesn't even show that he exists at all, alive or dead."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Jaeger,,"Notice the wood fire, Captain? Burning steadily, ember bed glowing, and it doesn't give off any heat at all."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"Fire without heat, mistaking all this for present day Earth without taking into account the time differential. Whatever we're dealing with, he certainly isn't all knowledgeable. He makes mistakes."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Discussing deep laid plans, I'll wager. I cannot wait to see them evolve."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"Trelane, we haven't planned"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,Tut tut. Do not think that I deplore your martial virtue of deception and stratagem. Quite the contrary. I have nothing but admiration for your whole species.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"If your admiration is genuine, you must have respect for our sense of duty too. Our ship has need of us. We have tasks to perform."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Oh, I can't let you go now. I was getting a bit bored until you came. You must stay. I insist."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,For how long?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Until this is over, of course."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,Until what is over?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Dear Captain, so many questions. Make the most of an uncertain future. Enjoy yourself today. Tomorrow may never come at all."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"Trelane, even if we wanted to stay, our companions are missing us."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Yes, I must experience your sense of concern, your grief at the separation."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,There are four hundred men and women aboard that ship.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Women? Do you mean that you actually have members of the fairer sex among your crew? Oh, how charming. And they must be all very beautiful. And I shall be so very gallant to them. Here, let me fetch them down at once."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,grabbing his arm,No.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,No?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,This game has gone on long enough. Those are crucial operating personnel. You can't
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,I can do anything I want. I should think you would have realised that by now.

18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,Transporter signal? What does he mean? You must tell me!
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"It means, Trelane, the party's over, thanks to Mister Spock."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,as the group is beamed away,Wait! I won't have this! I haven't dismissed you yet. Stop! I won't have this!
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,transporter room,Kirk,,"Everyone to stations. Report, Mister Spock. How were our scanners able to penetrate that radiation field?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,transporter room,Spock,,"They didn't, Captain. Not clearly. We merely beamed up all life forms in a given area."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,transporter room,Mccoy,,"Which means Trelane is not a life form as we know it, or he'd be beaming through now."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,transporter room,Kirk,,Prepare to warp out of here at once. Maximum speed.

18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Mccoy,,"I'm quaking, but I don't know if it's from laughter or terror."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Uhura,,"Doctor, what was it? What was down there?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, it was a. Oh, forget it."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Ross,,Look.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,,Trelane has appeared on the Bridge,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Trelane,,"Where are all your weapons, Captain? Don't you display your weapons?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,Trelane.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Trelane,,"Don't fret, Captain. I'm only a bit upset with you, but this Mister Spock you mentioned, the one responsible for that unseemly, impudent act of taking you from me, which is he?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,I am Spock.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Trelane,,"Surely not an officer. He isn't quite human, is he?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,My father is from the planet Vulcan.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Trelane,,And are its natives predatory?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,Not generally. But there have been exceptions.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Trelane,,Really? You will see to his punishment?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,On the contrary. I commend his action.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Trelane,,But I don't like him.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,Get off my ship.

18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,We're not going anywhere.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Trelane,,"Nonsense. I have an absolutely enchanting sojourn on Gothos planned for all of you, and you shan't spoil it for me. Anyway, the decor of my drawing room is much more appropriate"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,A lot of the clutter in the middle of the room has been replaced by a fully furnished dining table and six high-backed chairs. Sulu and DeSalle are already seated,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,And tasteful. Don't you agree?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Sulu,,No.

18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,"he does, and Sulu grabs DeSalle",
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Sulu,,We haven't even got our phasers.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Yes, of course. I forget that I shouldn't frighten you too much. But I warn you, you can't provoke me again. Come, everyone. Let's forget your bad manners. Let's be full of merry talk and sallies of wit. We have victuals to delight the palate and brave company to delight the mind. Come, Doctor, do partake. Ah, you've been quite derelict in your social duties, Captain. You haven't introduced me to the charming contingent of your crew."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,This is General Trelane.

18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,No doubt.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"She has the melting eyes of the queen of Sheba. The same lovely colouring. And this. Is this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium? Fair Helen, make me immortal with a kiss."

18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Spock,,Affirmative.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"I don't know if I like your tone. It's most challenging. That's what you're doing, challenging me?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Spock,,I object to you. I object to intellect without discipline. I object to power without constructive purpose.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Oh, Mister Spock, you do have one saving grace after all. You're ill-mannered. The human half of you, no doubt. (to Ross) Ah, come, my little wood nymph. Won't you dance with your swain? (to Uhura) Give us some sprightly music, my dear girl."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Uhura,,I don't know how to play this.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,Of course you do.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,"And she does, as Trelane dances with Ross",
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Sulu,,"Captain, how far do we go along with this charade?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"Until we can think our way out. Meanwhile, we accept his hospitality."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Mccoy,,"You should taste his food. Straw would taste better than his meat, and water a hundred times better than his brandy. Nothing has any taste at all."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Spock,,"It may be unappetizing, Doctor, but it is very logical."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Mccoy,,"There's that magic word again. Does your logic find this fascinating, Mister Spock?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Spock,,"Fascinating is a word I use for the unexpected. In this case, I should think interesting would suffice."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"You don't find this unexpected, Mister Spock?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Spock,,"That his food has no taste, his wine no flavour? No. It simply means that Trelane knows all of the Earth forms, but none of the substance."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"And if he's fallible, he can't be all powerful. Which means he has something helping him."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Spock,,Evidently.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,A machine? A device? Something which does these things for him.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Ah, my dear, don't we make a graceful pair? Except for one small detail. That dress hardly matches this charming scene."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,Suddenly she's wearing an empire line dress with feathers in her hair. Idealised Jane Austen,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Ah, yes, that's more what we want. The dashing warrior and his elegant lady."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"That mirror. It's part of his audience, his ego. He never wanders from it."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Spock,,"Is it ego, or something else?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,Explain.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Spock,,The mirror.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,What about it?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Spock,,You noted yourself he never gets very far from it. I suppose it could be vanity.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"No, no, Mister Spock, that's not the reason. What kind of a machine could do these things?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Spock,,"A machine with the ability to turn energy into matter guided by thought waves. It would have a very complex memory bank, and would be extremely sophisticated."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Narrator,,"KIRK; Like a computer, only much more. Could the machine that maintains the environment in this immediate area be kept in this house?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Spock,,I think not. A device capable of keeping out this planet's natural atmosphere would be immense.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,Good. I agree. That leaves me free
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,. Spock,,"Free, Captain?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"If I'm not mistaken, Mister Spock, I think I can turn his lights off at the source. (raises his voice) Don't be too upset by what you see, gentlemen. After all, his actions are those of an immature, unbalanced mind."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"I overheard that remark, Captain. I'm afraid I'll have to dispense with you."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,You only heard part of it. I just started.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,Oh?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,Yes. I want you to leave my crewmen alone. I want you to leave my crewwomen alone too. (to Ross) You're not to dance with him. I don't like it.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Does it actually make you angry, Captain?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,removing one of her long gloves,"I don't want you accepting his gifts, either."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Ross,,"Captain, please don't do this."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Well, I do believe the dear Captain is jealous of me."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"I don't care what you believe, just keep your hands off her!"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Oh, how curiously human. How wonderfully barbaric."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,I've had enough of your insulting attentions to her.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Of course you have. After all, that's the root of the matter, isn't it? You fight for the attention, the admiration, the possession of women."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"If it's fighting that you want, (slaps Trelane) you may have it."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,Are you challenging me to a duel?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,If you have the courage.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Oh, this is better than I'd planned. I shall not shirk an affair of honour."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,He gets a box from the mantle-shelf. It contains a pair of duelling pistols,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"A matched set. Just like the pair that slew your heroic Alexander Hamilton. And Captain, I never miss."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, stardate 2126.1. Delayed report. The whole bridge crew are the unwilling guests of the creature who calls himself Trelane. We are weaponless, powerless, and our only hope of escape with the Enterprise lies in playing his games. I've decided to make my move with the field of honour game, and everything depends on my one chance with the ancient duelling pistol."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Oh, how fascinating. I'm party to an actual human duel."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,Are you ready?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Quite ready, sir. We shall test each other's courage and then, and then we shall see."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,Enough talk. Let's get on with it.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"As you will, sir. Honour will be served, eh? Oh, wait! As the one challenged, I claim the first shot."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,We shoot together.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"It's my game and my rules, but if you need to be persuaded. (aims at Spock)"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,All right.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Spock,,Captain.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,"Trelane takes aim, then fires his pistol at the ceiling instead",
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"And now, Captain, how do you have the expression? My fate is in your hands."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,So Kirk shoots the mirror and everything goes hay-wire in the room,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,You've ruined everything!
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Spock,,The machine.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Desalle,,"Captain, subspace interference is clearing."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,Try to contact the ship.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"Oh, the remarkable treachery of the species."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"Go on, Trelane. Look at it. It's over. Your power is blanked out. You're finished."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Trelane,,"You've earned my wrath. Go back. Go back to your ship, all of you, and prepare. You're all dead men. You especially, Captain."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,,"He goes to his mirror, and vanishes",
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,drawing room,Kirk,,"Trelane! Everyone, we're getting out of here. Now. This is the Captain. Commence beaming up. Maximum speed."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,,"The men are already at their posts when the women arrive, and Yeoman Ross hasn't even got changed yet",
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,Set course for Colony Beta Six.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Sulu,,"Laid in, sir."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,"Full power acceleration from orbit, Mister Scott."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Scott,,"Full power, sir."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,"Emergency warp at the earliest possible moment, Mister Sulu."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Sulu,,"Standing by to warp, sir."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Uhura,,"Shall I make a full report to Spacefleet Command, sir?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,Not yet. They may trace our beam. Wait until we're well out of range.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,"Can we know his range is, Captain?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,We can take an educated guess. At the point we entered their solar system.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Uhura,,"Still no sign of pursuit. Instruments clear, sir."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,Good.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Ross,,May I take a moment to change?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, I think you might. Turn in your glass slippers. The ball is over."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Ross,,"Gladly, Captain."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,Hard to believe it ever happened.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, we're about to warp."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Desalle,,Large body ahead.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,,The planet swims back onto the viewscreen,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,Collision course.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,"Hard to port, Mister Sulu."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,"That was the planet Gothos, Captain."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,"Gothos? Mister Sulu, have we been going in circles?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Sulu,,"No, sir. All instruments show on course."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,"Gothos again, Captain."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,"Hard over, Mister Sulu."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,Cat and mouse game.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,With us as the mouse.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Desalle,,There it is again. Dead ahead.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,"Ninety degrees to starboard, Mister Sulu."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Sulu,,"Turning, Captain. Nut not veering off from it."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,"Ninety degrees sub-port, Mister Sulu. Adjust."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Sulu,,"Turn completed, and still accelerating toward the planet."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,Or it toward us.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,Decelerate into orbit. Prepare transporter room.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Mccoy,,"Captain, you're not beaming down."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, I am, Doctor McCoy. I am going to see our playful Mister Trelane and whatever it takes to make him give up our ship. Stand by communications. Mister Spock. If you don't receive a message from me within the hour, leave the vicinity at once. No turning back."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,,"The bright drawing-room is now an austere courtroom, with Trelane as the gowned and be-wigged judge",
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,The prisoner may approach the bench.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,Trelane.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,"Any attempt at demonstrations will weigh against you with the court, and this time my instrumentality is unbreakable."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,,A silhouette of a noose appears on the wall behind Kirk,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,I've had enough of your games.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,"Oh, the absurdity of these inferior beings. (reading from the charge sheet) And now, Captain James Kirk, you stand accused of the high crime of treason against a superior authority, conspiracy, and the attempt to foment insurrection. How do you plead?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,"I haven't come to plead in your court, Trelane."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,I warn you. Anything you might say has already been taken down in evidence against you.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,I've come for one purpose. To get back my ship.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,Irrelevant.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,"We've made you angry with our will to survive, haven't we?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,Uncalled for.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,Then vent your anger on me alone. I was the one who led the others. I was the one who shot out your mirror machine.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,And did you really think that was the only medium of instrumentality at my command?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,I took that chance. I'm willing to pay the price for chancing wrong.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,"Oh, then you do admit to the charge?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,"Yes, anything! Just allow the Enterprise to continue its journey. You pompous"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,Immaterial!
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,,Kirk leaves the dock and goes nose to nose with Trelane,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,Those people have done you no harm.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,Inadmissible!
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,"We're living beings, not playthings for your amusement."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,"Silence! This trial is over. You are guilty. On all counts, you are guilty. And according to your own laws, this court has no choice in fixing punishment. You will hang by the neck, Captain, until you are dead, dead, dead!"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, Stardate 2126.3. First Officer Spock reporting. Still no word from Captain Kirk on the surface below us. Waiting time is almost up. I will soon be forced to attempt departure as per instructions."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,"Until a moment ago, I didn't think it possible, but it was. (takes off his robes and wig) I did it. I was angry. I actually experienced genuine rage. This experiment has been successful."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,I'm glad you weren't disappointed.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,"Why, Captain, you're still angry. Would that I could have sustained that moment. Ah, no matter. Do you have a last request?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,"Trelane, if you think I'm going to cheerfully and obediently stick my head in that noose"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,"You still haven't learned. You have no choice. Oh, this is becoming quite tiresome. It's all so very easy."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,"That's your problem, Trelane. Everything is easy. It's given you a bad habit. You're not aware of it, but you have it. You don't think, Trelane. That's your problem. You miss opportunities, like your anger before and mine right now. Oh, you enjoy it, but you couldn't have accomplished it without me, and you know why? Because you're a bumbling, inept fool."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,"Take care, now."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,"Here you have an opportunity to experience something really unique, and you're wasting it. You want to commit murder? Go ahead, but where's the sport in a simple hanging?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,The sport?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,Yes. The terror of murder. The suspense. The fun.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,"Oh, I'm intrigued. Go ahead, Captain. What do you suggest?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,"A personal conflict between us. Not like the duel before, but the real thing. The stakes, a human life. Mine."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,waving a sword around,Yes! Yes!
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,That's the idea.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,"Oh, then you approve?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,"Yes, but you can do better than that. There's still not enough sport in just killing me with a sword."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,"I know. That will be dull. We'll have to have something more fanciful. Let me see. A hunt. A royal hunt. Predator against predator. Now, you may go hide in the forest anywhere you like and I shall seek. How does that strike you, Captain?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,"It strikes me very well. But you'll have to make it worth my while, Trelane. Why not up the stakes?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,The stakes?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Kirk,,"Yes. While we're playing our game, free my ship. Let it continue on its way. In return, I'll give you a contest you'll remember."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,courtroom,Trelane,,"Always back to your ship. Oh well. If it will add spice to the pursuit, I accept your terms, Captain."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,planet surface,,Kirk is outside the building,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,planet surface,Trelane,,"Remember, you must try not to let me find you too quickly."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,planet surface,Kirk,,Let me notify the Enterprise that it can go.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,planet surface,Trelane,,At your convenience.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,planet surface,Narrator,,"KIRK; Enterprise. Enterprise, this is Kirk. Can you hear me? (static) Get the ship away as fast as you can. I'll try and give you the time you need. Can you hear me?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,planet surface,,Trelane appears out of thin air,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,planet surface,Trelane,,Ah-ha!
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,planet surface,,Kirk dodges him and runs into the shrubs,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,planet surface,Narrator,,KIRK; Enterprise.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,planet surface,Trelane,,"Ah ha! Captain Kirk. You must try harder, Captain. This is too easy."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,planet surface,,They keep dodging amongst the shrubs,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,planet surface,Kirk,,"Enterprise. Enterprise, can you hear me?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,planet surface,,"Kirk takes an opportunity to get Trelane's sword off him, but when he takes a swing at his foe he just disappears and reappears again",
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,planet surface,Trelane,,"Touche, Captain. Touche. I must confess you scored first. But after all, I never played this game before."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,planet surface,,A sword appears in his hand,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,planet surface,Trelane,,And now let's have at it again!
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,planet surface,,"Kirk fences Trelane with a branch, but it breaks and he has to run off, leaving Trelane laughing",
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,outside the building,,The door will not open,

18,1,The Squire of Gothos,outside the building,Trelane,,"Ah-ha! Tallyho! (iron grids pen Kirk in) You made a noble fight of it, Captain."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,outside the building,Kirk,,"Remember, Trelane. You promised to let my ship go."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,outside the building,Trelane,,"Yes, but this is such sport. I must fetch all the others back to play. So this is victory. It has a sweet taste. Down, Captain. On your knees!"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,outside the building,Kirk,,"You haven't won, Trelane."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,outside the building,Trelane,,I have. I could run you through!
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,outside the building,Kirk,,But you haven't won anything.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,outside the building,Trelane,,"On your knees, Captain!"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,outside the building,Kirk,,No! Does it still taste as sweet?
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,outside the building,Trelane,,I order you. You've been beaten.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,outside the building,Kirk,,But I'm not defeated.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,outside the building,Trelane,,I order you! I order you! (Kirk disarms him and snaps the sword across his knee) You broke it! You broke my sword!

18,1,The Squire of Gothos,outside the building,Trelane,,You dare to defy me!
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,outside the building,Kirk,,"In fact, you've got a lot to learn about everything, haven't you?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,outside the building,,Kirk slaps his face,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,outside the building,Trelane,,I'll fix you for that! You cheated! You haven't played the game right. I'll show you!

18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock. Still thinking about Trelane, is that it?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,"For the record, how do we describe him? Pure mentality? Force of intellect? Embodied energy? Superbeing? He must be classified, sir."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,"God of war, Mister Spock."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,I hardly find that fitting.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,"Then a small boy, and a very naughty one at that."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,It will make a strange entry in the library banks.
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,"Then he was a very strange small boy. One the other hand, he was probably doing things comparable to the same mischievous pranks you played when you were a boy."
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Spock,,"Mischievous pranks, Captain?"
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,Yes. Dipping little girls' curls in inkwells. Stealing apples from the neighbours' trees. Tying cans on
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,,He's stopped by the look of horrified incredulity on Spock's face.,
18,1,The Squire of Gothos,bridge,Kirk,,"Forgive me, Mister Spock. I should have known better."

19,1,Arena,bridge,Sulu,,"Clear, Captain, but you"
19,1,Arena,ruins,Kirk,,Never mind about me. Protect my ship!
19,1,Arena,bridge,Sulu,,"Yes, sir. Photon torpedoes negative, Captain. I'm warping out of orbit."

19,1,Arena,ruins,,He throws it away and it goes bang,
19,1,Arena,ruins,Spock,,Very ingenious. They fed back my own impulses and built up an overload.
19,1,Arena,ruins,Kirk,,"We'll see how ingenious they are. Here, give me a hand with this grenade launcher. Lang!"
19,1,Arena,ruins,Spock,,Any word from the Enterprise?
19,1,Arena,ruins,Kirk,,Sulu's taken her out of orbit.
19,1,Arena,ruins,Kelowitz,,"They got Lang, sir."
19,1,Arena,ruins,Kirk,,Did you see them?
19,1,Arena,ruins,Kelowitz,,"No, sir."
19,1,Arena,ruins,Kirk,,"An evaluation, Mister Kelowitz. Where do you think they are?"
19,1,Arena,ruins,Kelowitz,,"If I were them, I'd go to the high ground on the right. I make it twelve hundred yards, azimuth eighty seven. It's pretty close for one of these little jewels, Captain."
19,1,Arena,ruins,Kirk,,It'll be a lot closer to them. Stand clear.
19,1,Arena,ruins,,"He drops a blue ball into the launcher, it zooms off and there is a blinding flash and bang. Silence reigns until Kirk's communicator beeps.",
19,1,Arena,ruins,Kirk,,Kirk here.
19,1,Arena,ruins,Sulu,,"Captain, the alien's withdrawing. She's at extreme range, but our sensors indicate she just activated her transporters."
19,1,Arena,ruins,Kirk,,"Lock on to the alien, Mister Sulu. I don't want to lose her."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, aye, sir. Our screens are down. We can beam you up now, sir."
19,1,Arena,ruins,Kirk,,I want a search party of thirty medical personnel beamed down immediately to search for survivors. Notify the transporter room. Lock onto us. We're beaming up.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, aye, sir."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's log, supplement. We have beamed back to the Enterprise and immediately set out in pursuit of the alien vessel. It appears to be headed toward a largely unexplored section of the galaxy."
19,1,Arena,sickbay,Kirk,,Can you tell me what happened?
19,1,Arena,sickbay,Man,,Scanners reported a ship approaching. We get them now and then. They're all welcome to use our facilities. You know that.
19,1,Arena,sickbay,Kirk,,"Yes, I know."
19,1,Arena,sickbay,Man,,"They came in space normal speed, using our regular approach route, but they knocked out our phaser batteries with their first salvo. From then on we were helpless. We weren't expecting anything! Why should we? We didn't have anything anyone would want."
19,1,Arena,sickbay,Kirk,,Easy. Easy.
19,1,Arena,sickbay,Man,,"They poured it on, like, like phasers, only worse, whatever they were using. I tried to signal them. We called up. Tried to surrender. We had women and children. I told them that! I begged them! They wouldn't listen. They didn't let up for a moment."
19,1,Arena,sickbay,Kirk,,"Lieutenant, the Enterprise received two messages, ostensibly from Cestus Three. One for the Enterprise to go there, and the other for myself and my tactical crew to beam down to the surface."
19,1,Arena,sickbay,Man,,"They hit us a full day before you got there, Captain. No messages came from us, Captain. Why did they do it? Why? Why did they do it? There has to be a reason. There has to be a reason!"
19,1,Arena,captain's quarters,Kirk,,"It was a trap. Getting the Enterprise to come to Cestus Three, getting us and our whole crew to come ashore."
19,1,Arena,captain's quarters,Spock,,Very clever. As to the reason?
19,1,Arena,captain's quarters,Kirk,,"The reason is crystal clear. The Enterprise is the only protection in this section of the Federation. Destroy the Enterprise, and everything is wide open."
19,1,Arena,captain's quarters,Spock,,"You allude to invasion, Captain, yet positive proof"
19,1,Arena,captain's quarters,Kirk,,I have all the proof I need on Cestus Three.
19,1,Arena,captain's quarters,Spock,,"Not necessarily, sir. Several possible explanations"
19,1,Arena,captain's quarters,Kirk,,"How can you explain a massacre like that? No, Mister Spock. The threat is clear and immediate. Invasion."
19,1,Arena,captain's quarters,Spock,,"Very well, then. If that's the case, you must make certain that the alien vessel never reaches its home base."
19,1,Arena,captain's quarters,Kirk,,"I intend to. If we can keep them in the dark as to our strength, they'll never dare move against us. Captain to helmsman."
19,1,Arena,captain's quarters,Sulu,,"Sulu here, sir."
19,1,Arena,captain's quarters,Kirk,,Is the alien still making warp five?
19,1,Arena,captain's quarters,Sulu,,"Affirmative, sir."
19,1,Arena,captain's quarters,Kirk,,Initiate warp six.
19,1,Arena,captain's quarters,Sulu,,"Affirmative, sir."
19,1,Arena,captain's quarters,Kirk,,"Overtake. Phaser banks, lock on to the enemy vessel. Stand by for firing orders. All hands, this is the Captain. We are going into battle. All hands, battle stations. Red alert. I repeat, red alert. This is no drill. This is no drill."
19,1,Arena,captain's quarters,Narrator,,"Captain's log, Stardate 3046.2. We are in hot pursuit of the alien vessel which destroyed the Earth outpost on Cestus Three."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,Mister DePaul.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Depaul,,"Yes, sir."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,Position.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Depaul,,"Twenty two point three parsecs beyond latest chart limit, sir."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"All scanners lock into computer banks. I want a complete record of this. Mister Spock, what do we have on this general area?"
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"Virtually nothing, Captain. No records of any explorations. There are rumours of certain strange signals on subspace channels. However, none has ever been recorded."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,Anything on intelligent life forms?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"Nothing specific, Captain. Unscientific rumours only. More like space legends."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Sulu, status, alien vessel."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Sulu,,"They must be aware we're after them, sir. They've gone to warp six also."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,Warp factor seven.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, aye, sir."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"Something the matter, Mister Spock?"
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"A sustained warp seven speed will be dangerous, Captain."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"Thank you, Mister Spock. I mean to catch them."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Scott,,"We'll either catch them or blow up, Captain. They may be faster than we are."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"They'll have to prove it. Yes, Mister Spock?"
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"You mean to destroy the alien ship, Captain?"
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,Of course.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,I thought perhaps the hot pursuit alone might be sufficient. Destruction might be unnecessary.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"Colony Cestus Three has been obliterated, Mister Spock."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"The destruction of the alien vessel will not help that colony, Jim."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"If the aliens go unpunished, they'll be back, attacking other Federation installations."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,I merely suggested that a regard for sentient life
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"There's no time for that. It's a matter of policy. Out here, we're the only policemen around. And a crime has been committed. Do I make myself clear?"
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"Very clear, Captain."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"I'm delighted, Mister Spock. Report, Mister Sulu."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Sulu,,"Alien ship maintaining interval, Captain. Now at warp seven."

19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,Is it on the alien's course?

19,1,Arena,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, sensors report we're being scanned."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,By the alien ship?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Uhura,,"No, sir. It's from that solar system ahead."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,Any interference? Resistance?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Uhura,,"No, sir, Just scanning beams. It's on an unusual wave length."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,Mister Spock?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,It would appear someone is curious about us.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Sulu, is the alien still heading away from that solar system?"
19,1,Arena,bridge,Sulu,,"Yes, sir. We're closing, sir."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant Uhura, anything further on those scanning beams?"
19,1,Arena,bridge,Uhura,,"There's no hostility, sir. They're not tractors or weapons of any sort, Just increasing in intensity. Steady. Regular. It's growing stronger, sir."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Sulu,,Captain!
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, what is it?"
19,1,Arena,bridge,Sulu,,"The alien. It's slowing down. Warp five, four, two. It's going sublight, sir. Sir? It's stopped dead in space."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,He may be turning to fight.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Sulu,,"No, sir. They're just dead out there."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,Are you sure?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Sulu,,"Yes, sir. Unmoving."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"Then we've got them. Go to Red Alert. Prepare to fire phaser banks. Sensors, lock on. Mister Sulu, continue closing. Mister Spock, lock phasers into computer. Computers will control attack."

Kirk is more agile than the reptile but nowhere near as strong. He boxes the Gorn's ears to get out of a bear-hug and runs up into the rocks looking for weapons. He throws a heavy rock at the Gorn, but it just bounces off his chest. When a boulder gets flung at him in return, Kirk retreats. Quickly.",
19,1,Arena,bridge,,Spock goes over to the Engineering Station,
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,Have you tried overload?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, sir. It does no good."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,How about bypassing the transformer banks? Feed the impulse engines directly.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Scott,,"I tried that, sir. Nothing."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"Lieutenant Uhura, have sensors learned anything about the nature of the force which holds us here?"
19,1,Arena,bridge,Uhura,,"No, sir. They report they definitely emanate from that solar system ahead."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,No indication of its composition? Gravimetric? Magnetic? Electronic?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Uhura,,"Nothing, sir."
19,1,Arena,planet surface,,"Standing on rocks, silhouetted against a clear blue sky, Kirk makes an entry on his recorder for posterity.",
19,1,Arena,planet surface,Kirk,,This is Captain James Kirk of the Starship Enterprise. Who ever finds this please get it to Starfleet Command. I'm engaged in personal combat with a creature apparently called a Gorn.
19,1,Arena,planet surface,,We see that the recording is also being transmitted and translated by the Gorn's device too,
19,1,Arena,planet surface,Kirk,,"He's immensely strong. Already he has withstood attacks from me that would have killed a human being. Fortunately, though strong, he is not agile. The agility and, I hope, the cleverness, is mine."
19,1,Arena,planet surface,,Back on the rock,
19,1,Arena,planet surface,Kirk,,"The Metrons, the creatures that sent us both here, said that the surface of the planet provides the raw material to construct weapons. There's very little here. Scrub brush, rocks, an abundance of mineral deposits, but no weapons in the conventional sense. Still, I need to find one. Bare-handed against the Gorn, I have no chance."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"Leave channel one open, Lieutenant, just in case."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, aye, sir."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Mccoy,,"What are you going to do, Mister Spock?"
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"I'm going to wait, Doctor. There's little else I can do."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Mccoy,,What about the Captain?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"If I could help him, I would. I cannot."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Mccoy,,"Now, you're the one that's always talking about logic. What about some logic now? Where's the Captain, Mister Spock?"
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"He's out there, Doctor. Out there somewhere in a thousand cubic parsecs of space, and there's absolutely nothing we can do to help him."
19,1,Arena,planet surface,,"Running up a slope, Kirk comes across a clump of mature bamboo. Good, solid, hollow stems, but he doesn't regard them as suitable clubs. He carries on gaining height. Meanwhile, the Gorn is using trailing vines to construct something. Kirk comes across an outcrop of minerals, and decides to tell us what they are.",
19,1,Arena,planet surface,Kirk,,"A large deposit of diamonds on the surface. Perhaps the hardest substance known in the universe. Beautifully crystallized and pointed, but too small to be useful as a weapon. An incredible fortune in stones yet I would trade them all for a hand phaser, or a good solid club. Yet the Metrons said there would be weapons, if I could find them. Where? What kind?"
19,1,Arena,planet surface,,"From his vantage point on the ridge, Kirk watches the Gorn at work, then spots a lone rock neatly balanced on a pinnacle above his adversary. He pushes it over, the Gorn looks up, then we get the cloud of dust and a view of the reptile under the rock, lying still. Confident, Kirk comes down to check on his kill, just in time to see the Gorn move, grasp his stone dagger, and get up again. The rock continues on its way down the slope. The mammal runs away, straight into reptiles trap of vines and rocks. Now Kirk is pinned under a boulder, and at his enemy's mercy",
19,1,Arena,planet surface,Narrator,,"But the Gorn has to move the boulder to be able to stab him, so once again Kirk is able to dodge away, albeit with a limp."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"This is the U.S.S. Enterprise calling the Metrons. Our channels are open. Come in, please. We urgently desire a conference. Please answer."
19,1,Arena,planet surface,,"Kirk hobbles up to a rock face with bright yellow powder spread across it, and takes a rest. We keep cutting to the Gorn, who can hear everything he says, remember.",
19,1,Arena,planet surface,Kirk,,"This may be my last entry. I am almost exhausted. Unless I find the weapon the Metron mentioned I have very little time left. Native sulphur, diamonds. This place is a mineralogist's dream. Yet there is something about sulphur. Something very old. Something? If only I could remember."
19,1,Arena,planet surface,,"The Gorn's roar comes closer, and he moves on",
19,1,Arena,bridge,Mccoy,,"The ship, our engines, our weapons. It's just inconceivable that we are immobilised."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"But it has happened, Doctor."
19,1,Arena,bridge,,Dimmed lights and swirly viewscreen again,
19,1,Arena,bridge,Metron,,"We are the Metrons. Your Captain is losing his battle. We would suggest you make whatever memorial arrangements, if any, which are customary in your culture. We believe you have very little time left."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Mccoy,,We appeal to you in the name of civilisation. Put a stop to this.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Metron,,"Your violent intent and actions demonstrate that you are not civilised. However, we are not without compassion. It is possible you may have feelings toward your Captain. So that you will be able to prepare yourself, we will allow you to see and hear what is now transpiring."
19,1,Arena,bridge,,"There on the viewscreen is their first sight of a Gorn, then Kirk and yet another mineral deposit.",
19,1,Arena,bridge,Mccoy,,If there were only some way we could contact him.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"Yes, indeed, Doctor, if only there were. Notice the substance encrusting that rock. Yes. Unless I'm mistaken, it's potassium nitrate."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Mccoy,,So?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"Perhaps nothing, Doctor. (Kirk tastes the mineral and spits it out) Perhaps everything."
19,1,Arena,bridge,,The bridge crew watch as enlightenment dawns and Kirk goes off in search of his other mineral discoveries.) GORN [OC]: Earthling! Captain,
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"Who is this, the Metron?"
19,1,Arena,bridge,Gorn,,"This is your opponent, Earthling. I have heard every word you have said."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,All right. What do you want?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Gorn,,I'm weary of the chase. Wait for me. I shall be merciful and quick.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,Like you were at Cestus Three?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Gorn,,You were intruding! You established an outpost in our space.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,You butchered helpless human beings
19,1,Arena,bridge,Gorn,,"We destroyed invaders, as I shall destroy you!"
19,1,Arena,bridge,Mccoy,,Can that be true? Was Cestus Three an intrusion on their space?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"It may well be possible, Doctor. We know very little about that section of the galaxy."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Mccoy,,Then we could be in the wrong.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,Perhaps. That is something best decided by diplomats.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Mccoy,,The Gorn simply might have been trying to protect themselves.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,Yes.
19,1,Arena,bridge,,"They watch as Kirk returns to the bamboo clump and picks out a short, wide stem.",
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"Fascinating. Good. Good. (Kirk cuts vines to length against a rock) He knows, Doctor. He has reasoned it out."
19,1,Arena,bridge,,Potassium nitrate gets shoveled into the bamboo,
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,Yes. Yes.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Mccoy,,"What is it, Spock?"
19,1,Arena,bridge,Narrator,,"SPOCK; An invention, Doctor. First potassium nitrate, and now if he can find some sulphur and a charcoal deposit or ordinary coal."
19,1,Arena,bridge,,"Kirk is at the outcrop of sharp diamonds, and putting them into the bamboo too.",
19,1,Arena,bridge,Mccoy,,What's he doing?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Narrator,,"SPOCK; Diamonds. The hardest known substance. Impelled by sufficient force, they would make formidable projectiles."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Mccoy,,What force?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"Recall your basic chemistry, Doctor. Gunpowder."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Gorn,,"Captain, let us be reasonable."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Gorn,,You have lost. Admit it to yourself. Stop running.
19,1,Arena,bridge,,"Now the sulphur goes into the cannon, and finally he finds a vein on coal.",
19,1,Arena,bridge,Narrator,,SPOCK; Coal.
19,1,Arena,bridge,,"Now Kirk settles down to empty the bamboo, crush the coal, make a hole in the bamboo for a fuse and then mix his ingredients a little more precisely.",
19,1,Arena,bridge,Mccoy,,Can he do it?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"If he has the time, Doctor. If he has the time."
19,1,Arena,bridge,,"The cannon is strengthened with the vine tied around it, and the gunpowder gets rammed home with a small branch. Finally the diamonds go in, and a piece of torn trouser will serve as a fuse, once he can raise a spark from a stone and the translating device. Fire is created as the Gorn approaches him from behind. Seeing the danger, he braces the cannon and fires it. The explosion blows the bamboo apart, and also incapacitates his opponent. Kirk picks up his fallen stone dagger and puts the point to the Gorn's windpipe, but cannot administer the coup de grace.",
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"No. No, I won't kill you. Maybe you thought you were protecting yourself when you attacked the outpost."
19,1,Arena,bridge,,"He throws the dagger away, stands up and shouts to the sky",
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"No, I won't kill him! Do you hear? You'll have to get your entertainment someplace else!"
19,1,Arena,bridge,,"The Gorn disappears, and a young blond boy in a white shift appears instead.",
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,You're a Metron?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Metron,,"Does my appearance surprise you, Captain?"
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,You seem more like a boy.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Metron,,"I am approximately fifteen hundred of your Earth years old. You surprise me, Captain."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,How?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Metron,,"By sparing your helpless enemy who surely would have destroyed you, you demonstrated the advanced trait of mercy, something we hardly expected. We feel there may be hope for your kind. Therefore, you will not be destroyed. It would not be civilised."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,What happened to the Gorn?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Metron,,"I sent him back to his ship. If you like, I shall destroy him for you."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,No. That won't be necessary. We can talk. Maybe reach an agreement.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Metron,,"Very good, Captain. There is hope for you. Perhaps in several thousand years, your people and mine shall meet to reach an agreement. You are still half savage, but there is hope. We will contact you when we are ready."
19,1,Arena,bridge,,"Kirk suddenly appears in front of the crew, who all leap to their feet.",
19,1,Arena,bridge,Uhura,,Captain! Are you all right?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"I don't know. I don't know. All right, everybody. Back to your posts. Let's get out of here."
19,1,Arena,bridge,,He takes his seat.,
19,1,Arena,bridge,Sulu,,Captain.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,Mister Sulu.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Sulu,,"It's impossible, but there's Sirius over there when it should be here. And Canopus. And Arcanis. We're. All of a sudden, we're clear across the galaxy, five hundred parsecs from where we are I mean, were. I mean"
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"Don't try and figure it out, Mister Sulu. Just plot a course for us back to Cestus Three."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, aye, sir."
19,1,Arena,bridge,,McCoy leaves,
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"After you touched off your primitive cannon, Captain, we lost the picture the Metron was sending us."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Narrator,,KIRK; You saw what happened down there?
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,Most of it. I would be interested in knowing what finally happened.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"We're a most promising species, Mister Spock, as predators go. Did you know that?"
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,I've frequently had my doubts.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Kirk,,"I don't. Not anymore. And maybe in a thousand years or so, we'll be able to prove it. Never mind, Mister Spock. It doesn't make much sense to me either. Take us back to where we're supposed to be, Mister Sulu. Warp factor one."
19,1,Arena,bridge,Sulu,,Warp factor one.
19,1,Arena,bridge,Spock,,"A thousand years, Captain?"
19,1,Arena,bridge,Narrator,,"Well, that gives us a little time."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,,Enterprise is orbiting a red and white planet.,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"Well, Mister Spock?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,"Very typical, Captain. Iron-silicon base, oxygen-hydrogen atmosphere, largely arid, no discernible life. No surprises."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"Photographic section, begin scanning. Tie in to visual section 988-TG, computer bank 22. Kirk out. About four more orbits ought to do it, Mister Lesley. That'll wrap it up. Lay in a course for Starbase 200."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Lesley,,"Aye, aye, Captain."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,Captain.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,,Something suddenly rocks the ship. We see a shot of a nebula along with the crew.,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,Mister Spock!
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,"Incredible, Captain."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,,And again.,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,What was that?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,"What my instruments read is totally unbelievable, Captain. Twice, for a split second each time, everything within range of our instruments seemed on the verge of winking out."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"I want facts, not poetry."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,"I have given you the facts, Captain. The entire magnetic field in this solar system simply blinked. The planet below, the mass of which we're measuring, attained zero gravity."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,That's impossible. What you're describing
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,Is non-existence.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Uhura,,"Standard General Alert signal from Starfleet Command, Captain."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,All stations to immediate alert status. Stand by.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, scanners now report a life object on the planet surface below."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,You just did a complete life survey five minutes ago. How are you just picking it up now?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,"Inexplicable, Captain. This reading began at approximately the moment that the pulsation phenomenon began to subside."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"Well, what is it, this object? Its physical makeup?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,"A living being. Body temperature 98.5 Fahrenheit. Mass, electrical impulses, movement. It is apparently human, Captain."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,And its appearance coincided with this cosmic winking-out?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Narrator,,SPOCK; Almost to the second.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,Explanation.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,None.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,Speculation. Could this being present any danger to the ship?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,Possible. Very possible.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant Uhura, notify Security to have an armed detachment of men ready to beam down with us. Let's go. Any word comes through from Starfleet Command, pipe it down immediately. Communications, priority one."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 3087.6. While investigating an uncharted planet, the Enterprise and at least this entire quadrant of space, has been subjected to violent, unexplained stress and force. Sensors have reported the presence of a human being on the planet below who might be connected with the phenomenon. With my first officer and a security team, I have set out in search of him."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,,"Kirk, Spock and four armed red-shirts arrive on a rocky terrain with a few scrubby bushes. They walk on a little way until they spot a strange craft on the ground. A one-man flying saucer with a perspex dome cockpit. As they reach it, a man calls out from a ridge.",
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"You came! Thank the heavens. There's still time. It's not too late. We can still stop him. But I, but I, need, need your help."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,,He falls.,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Uhura,,"Nothing yet, sir."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Masters,A woman in a blue uniform,"Report on the dilithium crystals, Captain."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,Yes.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Masters,,"Whatever that phenomenon was, it drained almost all of our crystals completely. It could mean trouble."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"You have a talent for understatement, Lieutenant. Without full crystal power, our orbit will begin to decay in ten hours. Re-amplify immediately."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Masters,,"Aye aye, sir."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,Any further magnetic disturbance?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,"Negative, Captain. Scanners indicate situation normal."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,Nothing?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,"Nothing. Illogical. An effect of such proportions, unexplainable by any established physical laws that I'm aware of. I have been able to ascertain one fact. Though the effect, whatever it was, was unquestioningly widespread, it was strongest here on the planet beneath us."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,Keep checking.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Uhura,,"Red Two message in one minute, Captain. Starfleet Command. Code Factor one, sir."

20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Mccoy,,"McCoy, Captain."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,Kirk here.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Mccoy,,About our patient.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, Doctor, quickly."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Mccoy,,"He'll make it. He'll be stiff and sore for a while, but he'll be all right."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,I'll talk to him later. Thank you. Kirk out.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Uhura,,"Message ready, Captain. Main screen, coming up."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"Kirk here. Enterprise standing by, Commodore."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Barstow,,You're aware of the effect an hour ago?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, sir."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Barstow,,"You may not be aware of its scope. It occurred in every quadrant of the galaxy and far beyond. Complete disruption of normal magnetic and gravimetric fields, timewarp distortion, possible radiation variations. And all of them centring on the general area which you are now patrolling. The question is, are these natural phenomena or are they mechanically created, and if they are, by whom? For what purpose? Your guess, Captain."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"Thank you, sir. I have considered all the alternatives. My best guess is it could be a prelude to invasion."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Barstow,,Exactly our consensus. I'm giving you the job of finding out specifically.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Narrator,,"KIRK; Aye, aye, sir. Can you assign me other starships as a reserve?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Barstow,,"Negative. I'm evacuating all Starfleet units and personnel within a hundred parsecs of your position. It's going to be tough on you and the Enterprise, but that's the job you've drawn. You're on your own."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"I see. You mean, we're the bait."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Barstow,,Good luck.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"Thank you, sir. (transmission ends) Maintain alert status at all battle stations."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye aye, sir."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"From the top, Mister Spock. First, the phenomenon came from the planet below. Secondly, the danger is apparently real and imminent."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,"Third, a closer examination of the planet's surface would be in order. My job, sir?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes. Meanwhile, I'll talk to our unexpected guest. Maybe he can provide some answers."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,kirk's quarters,Lazarus,,"That's how I came to be down there, Captain, pursuing the devil's own spawn, a thing I've chased across the universe. He's humanoid outside, but inside, he's a hideous, murdering monster. I'll get him, Captain. I swear it."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,You say this one man
20,1,The Alternative Factor,kirk's quarters,Lazarus,,Not man! Thing.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Thing destroyed your entire civilisation.

20,1,The Alternative Factor,kirk's quarters,Lazarus,,"I was inspecting magnetic communications satellites. You believe me, don't you?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Before we picked you up, our ship sustained a number of incredible effects."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,kirk's quarters,Lazarus,,"That was he! He's death, anti-life, he lives to destroy."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Is he the thing that attacked you?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,kirk's quarters,Lazarus,,Yes. I give you my word. I swear it.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"We don't have any other facts, any information."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,kirk's quarters,Lazarus,,Then you'll join me in my holy cause? Help me in visiting justice and vengeance upon him.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,My only cause is the safety of my ship and the mission we're on. You'll beam down with me and I'll check your story out.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,,The flying saucer is being minutely examined,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,"Spock, find anything?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Spock,,"Negative, Captain. Anything from our guest?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,"According to him, there's a creature of some sort down here, a humanoid."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Spock,,"Lieutenant Uhura communicated that information. I ordered re-confirmation on our sensors. They indicate no living creature on this planet. I suggest, Captain, that you've been lied to."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"Captain, you yourself said there were no other explanations. Why do you give credence to this man?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Spock,,"I fail to comprehend your indignation, sir. I've simply made the logical deduction that you are a liar."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,Let's have it. The truth this time.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,,"Another one of those 'nebula overlay' events happens, and Lazarus starts shouting then runs off.",
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"No! You've come back in, is it? Well, don't stop. Here I am. Come at me again. We'll finish it!"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,Can you identify that?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Spock,,"I'm trying, Captain."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,"Lazarus! You stay here. All personnel, security red."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,Come! Come! It'll do you no good. I'll chase you to the very fires of hell!
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,,We're treated to a negative image of Lazarus suddenly being pounced on by another person. They fight as the picture keeps being rotated to make you dizzy. Then it all ends and Lazarus staggers back on the planet surface again.,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,"Lazarus, what happened?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,I saw it again. The thing. It attacked me.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,Let's get out of here.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Spock,,"Captain, readings of the effect indicate it centred here on this planet, almost on this very spot."

As for Lazarus, the story he tells me about the humanoid continues to trouble me."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,Any luck?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,"Negative, Captain. I can no more explain the occurrence of the second phenomenon than I can the first."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,If there's a shred of truth to what Lazarus said
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,"That a single creature, a humanoid could be responsible for an effect of such magnitude?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,Hard to believe.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,Indeed.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,But the rest of his story seems to fit. His wounds testify to an apparent confrontation with something.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,Affirmative.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"Assuming there is a humanoid, a something, how does he do it? He has no weapons, no power."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, I only know for certain that the occurrence of the phenomenon coincides exactly with the moments that Lazarus has his alleged confrontations."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Uhura,,"Doctor McCoy asking to see you in sickbay, Captain."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I don't know, Jim. Maybe I'm imagining things, and maybe I'm not. You tell me."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Kirk,,"You tell me. That's why you brought me down here, isn't it."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well, as you know, we both brought Lazarus in here and I treated a deep abrasion on his forehead, right?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Kirk,,Right.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Then I bandaged it, I stepped into this room for just a moment"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Kirk,,"Bones, I've got a lot of things to do. Get to the point."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well, say he's got the constitution of a dinosaur, recuperative powers ditto. As we both know, I'm a bright young medic with a miraculous touch. Why then, when I returned, there wasn't a trace of that wound on his forehead. Not even a bruise. It was like he had never been injured."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Kirk,,Where is he?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I don't know, Jim. This is a big ship. I'm just a country doctor."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,rec room,,Lazarus is sitting nearby when the following conversation takes place.,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,rec room,Engineer,,Hi.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,rec room,Masters,,Hi. Coffee?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,rec room,Engineer,,"Is that an order, Lieutenant?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,rec room,Masters,,I know what you mean. Re-amplification finished on the dilithium crystals?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,rec room,Engineer,,Yes. Ready and waiting.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,rec room,,"They leave, then Lazarus follows.",
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,,"Lazarus has some sort of seizure and we get the nebula effect, the fight, and then... he has a plaster on his forehead again. Kirk and McCoy exit the turbolift and spot him.",
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,Kirk,,"Lazarus, are you all right?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,Lazarus,,Yes. But impatient. Have you decided to help me yet?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,,McCoy removes the plaster to show the cut.,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,Lazarus,,Is something wrong?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,Kirk,,No. I have a ship's physician with a strange sense of humour.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,Mccoy,,"This is no joke, Jim. I know what I saw."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,Uhura,,Bridge calling the captain.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,Kirk,,Go.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,Spock,,"Request you come to the Bridge, Captain."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,Kirk,,Find something?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,Spock,,Something quite extraordinary.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,Kirk,,"On my way. Lazarus, you're with me. Bones, if I had time, I'd laugh."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,"Main screen on, Lieutenant."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Uhura,,"Screen on, sir."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,,Kirk and Lazarus enter.,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,"Source of radiation, Captain."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,,A bright flashing light on the planet.,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,How is it the scanners didn't pick it up before?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,Because it is not there.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"Another riddle? First Doctor McCoy, then you?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,"What I mean, Captain, is that according to our usual scanning procedures, there is nothing there that could be causing that effect."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,But it is there.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,"Affirmative. I confess I am somewhat at a loss for words. It may be described, though loosely and inaccurately, as a rip in our universe."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,A what?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,"A kind of physical warp, Captain, in which none of our established physical laws apply with any regularity. However, with the dilithium crystals, I was able to localise it."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Lazarus,,Yes! That's it! The dilithium crystals. With their power we could do it.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Spock,,You refer to the humanoid?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Lazarus,,"Yes. We've got him, Captain, we've got him."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,What do the crystals have to do with it? All they show us the point of radiation.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Lazarus,,"That's just it, that's the key. That's the way to trap him. That's the solution. Captain, I beg of you. I plead, I demand. Give me the crystals."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,Out of the question. Those crystals are the very heart of the power of my ship.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Lazarus,,You fool! There won't be any ship if we don't kill him. He'll destroy all of you.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"How? Now you tell me how. All I've heard is double-talk, lies, threats, accusations that don't hold water. Now you tell me, how it presents a danger to my ship?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Lazarus,,"I warn you, Captain. You'll give me the crystals."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"Don't threaten me, Lazarus."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Lazarus,,"No threat intended. Captain, I'll have my vengeance."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,,"He leaves the Bridge by the turbolift, and the guard follows a moment later. Lazarus is walking along a corridor when he has another seizure and loses the head injury. Lazarus heads for...",
20,1,The Alternative Factor,engineering,Engineer,,"Lieutenant Masters, Captain's calling."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,engineering,Masters,,Masters here.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,engineering,Kirk,,"Lieutenant, can you prepare an experimentation chamber in ten minutes? All dilithium crystals, full power."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,engineering,,"We see Lazarus jump the engineer, out of her sight.",
20,1,The Alternative Factor,engineering,Masters,,"I'll check, sir."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,engineering,,"She goes into the room where Lazarus is hiding, checks a panel and leaves again.",
20,1,The Alternative Factor,engineering,Masters,,"Captain. The chamber will be ready in ten minutes, sir. My assistant and I will"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,engineering,,Lazarus injects her neck with something.,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,engineering,Masters,,Captain! Captain!
20,1,The Alternative Factor,engineering,Kirk,,"Lieutenant, what is it? What's wrong? Lieutenant?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, Security reports Lazarus missing."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 3088.7. We are no closer to finding an answer to the strange phenomenon than we were at the beginning. Not only have two of my crewmen been attacked, two of our dilithium crystals are missing, and without them the Enterprise cannot operate at full power. They must be found."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,,This Lazarus has his head injury back again.,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,"Fact. You said you needed the crystals. Fact. An hour after you said you must have them, they were missing. Fact. Two of my crewmen were attacked."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Lazarus,,"And fact, Captain. I didn't take the crystals. I'm not the one. Find my enemy, find the beast, and you'll find the crystals."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,How'd this beast get aboard my ship?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Lazarus,,He did. Isn't that enough?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,No. He didn't transport up. A report would've been made.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Lazarus,,I tell you we're dealing with a creature capable of destroying worlds.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Spock,,Why does he need the crystals? For what reason?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Lazarus,,"For the same reason that I do. Listen to me. He's humanoid. Why, he he can pilot a spaceship. He can compute formulas to destroy races. He can steal an energy source for his vehicle so he can escape from me. Are you deaf as well as blind?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,Sit down. The crystals certainly aren't here. There's an unexplained radiation source on the planet. Obviously some connection. We'll check it out. Organise a search party immediately. Mister Lazarus will beam down with us.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Lazarus,,"Thank you, Captain."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,"You may not have reason to thank me, depending on what we find."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"What do you believe now, Captain?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,I believe the missing crystals aren't in your ship. Mister Spock?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Spock,,Unable to locate the source of radiation.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,Why not? You had it spotted on the Enterprise.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Spock,,"It has simply disappeared, Captain."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,"I want every inch of this terrain checked. Look for footprints, movement, anything. Call out if you spot anything. Don't be afraid to use your weapons."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,,"The entire party leave the little spaceship. The Starfleet group splits into two and take different lines along a rocky outcrop. Lazarus heads off on his own and has one of his nebula moments. There's a fight in negative space and then it's over again. Kirk sends his two security men on ahead, and for some reason Lazarus decides to climb down a cliff face. He dislodges a rock and it goes tumbling. Lazarus calls out, then follows it.",
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"Captain, look out!"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Mccoy,,He's coming out of it now.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Lazarus,,"The thing, the thing."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Mccoy,,It's all right. You're on board the Enterprise.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Lazarus,,"The rock, I"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Mccoy,,How's your head?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Lazarus,,Aches.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Kirk,,You saved my life down there. I want to thank you.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Lazarus,,Why shouldn't I?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Kirk,,I have some questions I want to ask you.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Not now, Jim."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Kirk,,It's necessary.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Lazarus,,Go ahead. It's all right.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Kirk,,"This is a computer report of the evidence you gave at your first screening. It calls you a liar, Lazarus. For one thing, there's no planet at the location you said you came from. There never has been. If you want help from us, you'd better start telling the truth."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Lazarus,,You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Kirk,,Try us.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Lazarus,,"All right. I distorted a fact in the interest of self-preservation, for my holy cause. I needed help, not censure. Freedom, not captivity for being a madman. I was afraid that's what you'd call me if I told you the truth."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Kirk,,I'll have the truth now.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Lazarus,,"My planet, my Earth, or what's left of it, is down there beneath us."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Kirk,,What are you saying?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Lazarus,,"My spaceship is more than just that. It's a time chamber, a time-ship, and I. I am a time traveller."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Kirk,,"And this thing you search for is a time traveler, too?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Lazarus,,"Oh, yes. He's fled me across all the years, all the empty years to a dead future on a murdered planet he destroyed. Help me! Give me the tools I need to kill him! The crystals! Don't let him get away! Don't let him get away."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Kirk,,"Lazarus, you're hurt. I know. I sympathise, but I've got four hundred and thirty other men to worry about. Now where are those crystals?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Lazarus,,"I told you, he's got them. He took them. The thing! The thing!"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Mccoy,,"He's got to get some rest, Jim. And would you get that muscleman out of my Sickbay. (gestures at the security guard)"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Kirk,,Dismissed.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,,The guard leaves.,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Mccoy,,He's in a lot of pain.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Kirk,,"Sometimes pain can drive a man harder than pleasure. I'm sure you know that, Doctor."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well, don't worry, he's not going anywhere. Not this time."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,sickbay,,"But once the medical bay is empty, Lazarus gets out of bed and has a quick seizure.",
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,"What have we got, Mister Spock? A magnetic effect which produces a winking-out phenomenon. A mysterious, unidentified source of radiation on the planet. Lazarus, a walking powder keg. Your rip in the universe. A so-called murdering humanoid."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Spock,,"True, Captain, but more significant to me is the fact that our ship's instruments are specifically designed to locate and identify any object in our universe, be it energy or matter."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,But by using those instruments you were unable to identify the source of the radiation on the planet.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Spock,,Correct. Which would seem to be impossible.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,Are the instruments in order?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Spock,,Perfect working condition.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,Then what you say leads obviously to one alternative. The source of radiation is not from our universe.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Spock,,"Nor in our universe, Captain. It came from outside."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,"Outside? Yes, that would explain a lot. Another universe, perhaps in another dimension, occupying the same space at the same time."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Spock,,"The possible existence of a parallel universe has been scientifically conceded, Captain."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,"All right. What would happen if another universe, say a minus universe, came into contact with a positive universe such as ours?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Spock,,Unquestionably a warp. A distortion of physical laws on an immense scale.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,"Which is what we've been experiencing. The point where they come into contact, couldn't that be described as a hole?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Spock,,Indeed. I point out that a hole in the universe or in a simple container can either allow the contents to escape
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,Or what is outside to enter. The invasion that Commodore Barstow suspected.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Spock,,There has been no evidence of a large-scale invasion.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,"But a small scale invasion, Mister Spock. What is your analysis of the mental state of Lazarus?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Spock,,"Difficult, Captain. One moment, paranoid, the next, calm, mild, rational. Almost as if he were two men."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,"Yes, two men. Different, but identical. And a hole in the universe. No, not a hole, A door."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Spock,,Through which these two beings are somehow enabled to pass.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,"Take a look at Lazarus. One minute he's at the point of death, the next he's alive, well, strong as a bull."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Spock,,"The cut on his forehead. First he has it, then it's gone, then he has it again."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,Which is physically impossible for one man.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Spock,,"Quite right. Unquestionably, there are two of him."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,What's going on? This leaping from universe to universe. This wild talk about a murdering creature who destroys civilisations What's the purpose?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Spock,,"Jim, madness has no purpose or reason, but it may have a goal. He must be stopped, held. Destroyed if necessary."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,I don't follow you.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Spock,,"Two parallel universes project this. One positive, the other negative. Or, more specifically, one matter, the other antimatter."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,Do you know what you're saying? Matter and antimatter have a tendency to cancel each other out. violently.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Spock,,"Precisely. Under certain conditions, when two identical particles of matter and antimatter meet"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,"Like Lazarus. Identical. Like both Lazarus', only one is matter and the other antimatter. If they meet."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Spock,,"Annihilation, Jim. Total, complete, absolute annihilation."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,briefing room,Kirk,,"Of everything that exists, everywhere."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,,"Lazarus is prowling when he spots a High Voltage access panel. He opens it, removes a couple of transistors then puts one back to short it out. He leaves the area as smoke billows forth.",
20,1,The Alternative Factor,engineering,,Smoke starts to come from the main control panels.,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,engineering,Masters,,The energiser has shorted. Get out of here. Sound the alarm.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,engineering,Engineer,,"Come on. You, too, Lieutenant."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,engineering,Masters,,"No, I've got to stay"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,engineering,Engineer,,We've got to get out of here. The whole thing might blow!
20,1,The Alternative Factor,engineering,,He bustles her out into the corridor.,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,Masters,,Engineering calling Bridge. Fire! Fire in the energising circuit.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,,"Hidden by the smoke, Lazarus enters Engineering.",
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Uhura,,"Fire, Captain. Engineering. Situation critical."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,bridge,Kirk,,"All available personnel, on the double. Spock, with me."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,,Two firefighters in protective gear are entering Engineering,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,Kirk,,Report.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,Engineer,,"Under control, sir, but it couldn't have started by itself."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,Spock,,Lazarus. A trick to get the crystals.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,transporter room,Chief,,"Sir, you shouldn't be in here."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,transporter room,Lazarus,,"Oh, I didn't know."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,transporter room,,"He knocks the poor lad out, then sets co-ordinates and is beamed to the planet carrying a bundle.",
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,,Kirk and Spock exit Engineering.,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,Kirk,,He's probably beaming down with the crystals right now. I'm going after him. You organise a security detail. Follow me as soon as you can.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,corridor,Spock,,Spock to Bridge.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,,Lazarus climbs into his saucer and unwraps the crystals.,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"I'll get you now. I have a threshold. Run, run. I'll get you now."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,transporter room,Kirk,,Energise.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"It's done, it's done! Finished, finished. It's done. It's done. It's done, it's done."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,Lazarus.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,Done. No! Don't! Not you!
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,,Kirk leans into the saucer - and vanishes.,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,No!
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,,Kirk goes into that negative space and finds that there is nowhere to run to. Then suddenly he's on the ground on the planet again. Or is he? He walks over to the saucer and is greeted by uninjured Lazarus.,
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"Welcome, Captain. I wasn't expecting you."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,"No, him."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"Yes, him. You understand."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,Not completely. This is a parallel universe?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,Of course.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,Antimatter?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"Here, yes."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,And if identical particles meet
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"The end of everything. Civilisation, existence, all gone. I tried to stop him, Captain. That's why I took your dilithium crystals."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,He has two more.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"That's very bad, Captain. If he comes through at a time of his own choosing. But I think if we hurry and you will help me, he can yet still be stopped. There's little time left. He meant to come through. When you accidentally passed through, it drained his crystals. It'll take him about ten minutes to re-energise with the equipment aboard his ship. That should give us enough time."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,Exactly what did I pass through?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"That's hard to explain, Captain. I call it an alternative warp. It's sort of a negative magnetic corridor where the two parallel universes meet. It's sort of a safety valve. It keeps eternity from blowing up."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,"This corridor, is it what caused the magnetic effect, the winking out phenomenon?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"Precisely, Captain, but not because of its existence. Because, because my foe entered. The corridor is like a prison, with explosives at the door. Open the door, and the explosives might go off. Stay inside"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,And the universe is safe.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"Both universes, Captain. Yours and mine."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,Surely Lazarus must realise what would happen if you should meet face to face outside the corridor.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"Of course he knows, Captain, but he's mad. You heard him. He's lost his mind. When our people found a way to slip through the warp and prove another universe, an identical one, existed, it was too much for him. He could not live knowing that I lived. He became obsessed with the idea of destroying me. The fact that it meant his own destruction, and everything else, meant nothing to him."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,"So you're the terrible thing, the murdering monster. The creature."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"Yes, Captain. Or he is. It depends on your point of view, doesn't it? It's ready, Captain. If we can force him into the corridor while I'm waiting for him, we can put an end to this. But if he comes through at a time of his own choosing and breaks into this universe to find me"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,I understand. What do you want me to do?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"Find him. Force him through his threshold, while I'm waiting for him, into the corridor, and I'll hold him there."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,You can't hold him forever.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"Can't I, Captain? You destroy his ship."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,"If I destroy his ship, won't yours also be destroyed?"
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,It will.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,And your door will be closed.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,"Yes, and so will his."
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,You'll be trapped inside that corridor with him forever. At each other's throats throughout time.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,Is it such a large price to pay for the safety of two universes?
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Kirk,,I'm ready.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,Lazarus,,Send him to me. I'll be waiting.
20,1,The Alternative Factor,planet surface,,"Lazarus activates his crystals manually, and Kirk vanishes, then reappears on 'our' planet and gestures to Spock who has come down with two guards.",

21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,bridge,Spock,,"We cannot return him to Earth, Captain. He already knows too much about us and is learning more. I do not specifically refer to Captain Christopher, but suppose an unscrupulous man were to gain certain knowledge of man's future? Such a man could manipulate key industries, stocks, and even nations. and in so doing, change what must be. And if it is changed, Captain, you and I and all that we know might not even exist."

21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,sickbay,Christopher,,Why? You said I made no relative contribution.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,sickbay,Spock,,"Poor choice of words on my part. I neglected, in my initial run-through, to correlate the possible contributions by offspring. I find, after running a crosscheck on that factor, that your son Colonel Shaun Geoffrey Christopher headed, or will head, the first successful Earth-Saturn probe, which is a rather significant"

We tracked his plane wreckage down after our tractor beam crushed it. It crashed in an open section of southern Nebraska."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Kirk,,That means those search parties will be crawling all over that wreckage.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Spock,,And Captain Christopher himself complicated the matter.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Christopher,,"When I made visual contact, I turned on my wing cameras. I got close enough to take some pretty clear pictures of you. Air Defence Command will be processing that film fast. And ADC Control was probably recording my radio transmissions."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Kirk,,"If I remember my history, these things were being dismissed as weather balloons, sun dogs, explainable things. At least publicly."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Spock,,"Captain, our tractor beam caught and crushed an Air Force plane. It'll be impossible to explain this as anything other than a genuine UFO. Possibly alien, definitely destructive."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Kirk,,"What about our problem, Mister Spock? Any ideas on how to get us back to our own time?"
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Spock,,"A theory. A reverse application of what happened to us. Logically, it could work. Also, logically, there are a hundred variables, any one of which could put us in a worse position than we're in now."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Kirk,,"We're going to have to go back and get those reports and photos. If the Captain feels duty bound to report what he saw, there won't be any evidence to support him."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Christopher,,That makes me out to be either a liar or a fool.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Kirk,,Perhaps.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Spock,,Not at all. You'll simply be one of the thousands who thought he saw a UFO.

21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Kirk,,"No, Captain. Thank you, but if anything should go wrong, you might get hurt. We couldn't risk that. Neither could you or your son."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Christopher,,"Well, I'd like to help. I could sketch a layout of the place for you. Show you where the record section and the photo lab are."

21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,adc statistical services,Kirk,,Your surprise package is an Air Police sergeant from the base.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,transporter room,Kirk,,I want you to keep him in the transporter room. No sense in letting him see more of the ship than is necessary.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,transporter room,Spock,,"I don't believe there'll be trouble in that respect, Captain."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,transporter room,,The Sergeant still hasn't hardly moved a muscle when McCoy gently takes the gun and communicator out of his hands.,
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,transporter room,Spock,,Our guest seems quite satisfied to remain where he is.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,adc statistical services,Kirk,,Kirk out. (returns to the magnetic tapes) What was the chronometer reading when we first sighted Christopher's jet?
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,adc statistical services,Sulu,,"Five thirty in that time zone, maybe a little after."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,adc statistical services,Kirk,,"Put it at the end of these tapes, will you? Get them all."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,adc statistical services,,They leave the room and head off down the corridor to the photo section,

21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,dark room,,Kirk is checking reels of film,
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,dark room,Kirk,,"Yes, that's it. That's all of them. Signal Mister Spock that we're almost ready to beam up. I'll make a check of the files just in case."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,dark room,Sulu,,"Yes, sir."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,photo lab,,"Kirk walks out into the main lab just as security walk in. He shuts the door behind him and fights the three men, making lots of noise so Sulu can hear what is going on. He's eventually restrained, and the Colonel takes a look in the dark room. It's empty.",
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,photo lab,Fellini,,All right. Where's the other one?
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,photo lab,Kirk,,What other one?
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,photo lab,Fellini,,Your partner. I saw you looking that was and I saw somebody move in there.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,photo lab,Kirk,,"No, no, no. Just me. Besides, could anyone get out of here without your seeing them?"
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,photo lab,Fellini,,No. Nobody should have been able to.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Spock,,"Your decision to beam up was quite correct, Mister Sulu."

21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Scott,,"We've completed re-energising the warp engines, sir. We can re-fire them anytime."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Spock,,"Do so now, engineer. We'll need all power to test our theory."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Scott,,"Aye, sir. Engine room out."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Spock,examining a roll of film,Poor photography.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Blast your theories and observations, Mister Spock. What about Jim? He's down there alone, probably under arrest. He doesn't have a communicator, and we can't locate him or beam him back aboard without one."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Spock,,"I am aware of that, Doctor. This is the first officer. Captain Christopher to the briefing room."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Fellini,,"Now, look, Mister. You and I had better start communicating. I want to know how you got in here. That's a simple question. Give me a simple answer. Nobody saw you. You got all the way inside without tripping any alarm. How did you do it?"
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,"Believe me, Colonel, you wouldn't believe me."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Fellini,,Don't try to be funny. How did you get in?
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,I popped in out of thin air.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Fellini,,You seem to think this is some kind of a game.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,"No, Colonel. I know it's no game."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Fellini,,All right. What did you say your name was?
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,"For the fourth time, my name is James T. Kirk."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Fellini,,"And how did you get inside a top security installation, James T. Kirk?"
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,"I told you, you wouldn't believe me."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,,The Colonel picks up the communicator,
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,"Colonel, would you mind being careful with that?"
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Fellini,,"That worries you a little bit, huh? What is that, a radio? Transmitter of some kind?"
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,Of some kind.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Fellini,,"You can be more specific than that, Kirk. I don't like mysteries."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,"If you don't stop being careless with that, you'll have one. A big one."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Fellini,,"I'll have it disassembled and examined. We are not dummies, mister. We know how to find out things we want to know. (tosses it to the guard standing nearby) What is that? Is that a uniform of some kind?"
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,This little thing? Just something I slipped on.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Fellini,,"Kirk, maybe you don't realise how serious this is. Sabotage of a government installation"
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,Did I sabotage something?
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Fellini,,No. We stopped you in time. But what would you have done if we hadn't found you?
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,"Believe me, Colonel, nothing at all."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Fellini,,Is that what you're here for? Nothing at all?
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,That's what would have happened if you hadn't interfered.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Fellini,,"All right, Kirk. Maybe this will make you laugh. Sabotage, espionage, unauthorised entry, burglary. How are those for starters? And I can think up lots more if you don't start talking."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,"All right, Colonel. The truth is, I'm a little green man from Alpha Centauri. A beautiful place. You ought to see it."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Fellini,,I am going to lock you up for two hundred years.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,That ought to be just about right.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Christopher,,"He's probably being held in security section. Even if they've notified the authorities, it'll take a little time for someone to get there."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Spock,,"Quite logical, Captain. Can you give us the co-ordinates to beam down a landing party near those interrogation rooms?"
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Christopher,,"Yes, but you're not going to get them unless you take me with you."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Spock,,"I can't do that, Captain."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Mccoy,,If something went wrong
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Christopher,,"Something's already gone wrong. Of course, you could beam down anywhere inside that base, but it would take time to find him."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Spock,,"Mister Sulu, you and Captain Christopher will beam down with me. The captain will provide the co-ordinates for the transporter chief."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Sulu,,Shall I issue phasers?
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Spock,,"One for you, one for me. Set them on heavy stun force."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Sulu,,"Yes, sir. (leaves)"
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Christopher,,"You don't trust me, Spock."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Spock,,"In fact, I do. But only to a certain point."

21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,transporter room,Sergeant,,Uh-huh.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,transporter room,Kyle,,What would you like?
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,transporter room,Sergeant,,Maybe some chicken soup.

21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,,"It's Spock, who neck-pinches the hapless airman. Kirk punches Lt. Colonel Fellini's lights out.) SPOCK: Don't you find that painful, Captain",
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,"Yes, I do. What's he doing here?"
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Spock,,He knew the exact beam down co-ordinates for this section of the base. It was necessary to bring him along.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,"I see. No harm done. Mister Sulu, did you check out those tapes?"
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Sulu,,Mister Spock ran them through. They were the right ones. We got them all.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,,Spock goes into the Colonel's office,
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Christopher,,They know you've been here.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,"All they have is a mystery and no answers. Mister Sulu, signal the Transporter Chief. Four to beam up."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Sulu,,"Yes, sir."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Christopher,holding the security guard's gun,Uh-uh. Not me.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,Don't be a fool. You know what's at stake.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Christopher,,"You bet I do. My family. A son that isn't born yet. You don't have to return me now, Captain. Spock, come out of there."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,You can't explain your presence on the base.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Christopher,,I told you it's my duty to report everything I've seen. That's explanation enough. Spock!
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Kirk,,"You'll go home, Christopher but you'll do it our way."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,,Spock appears in the doorway behind Christopher,

21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,guard room,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, Stardate 3114.1. We must make an attempt to break free of this time, or we and our reluctant passengers will remain its prisoners. All we have is a theory and a few facts."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Spock,,"Mister Scott and I both agree that the only possible solution is the slingshot effect, like the one that put us here. My computations indicate that if we fly toward the sun, seek out its magnetic attraction, then pull away at full power, the whiplash will propel us into another time warp."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Christopher,,Slingshot effects are fine for you people. How do you propose to return the Sergeant and me?
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Spock,,"Logically, as we move faster and faster toward the sun, we'll begin to move backward in time. We'll actually go back beyond yesterday, beyond the point when we first appeared in the sky. Then, breaking free will shoot us forward in time, and we'll transport you back before any of this happened."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Kirk,,"You won't have anything to remember, because it never would have happened."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Christopher,,What if you can't pull free of the sun?
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Scott,,"Oh, we'll do that all right, Captain. We'll not be getting so close that my engines couldn't pull us out. What I am worried about, sir, that we may not have much control when we're thrown forward again."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Kirk,,Helm control?
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Scott,,"Braking control, sir. If I can't stop us soon enough, we may overshoot our time, and if I stop the engines suddenly the strain may tear us apart. Anyway we do it, it's a mighty rough ride."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,briefing room,Kirk,,"Well, gentlemen, we all have to take a chance. Especially if one is all you have. Assume your stations."

21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,bridge,Christopher,,I never thought I'd make it into space. I was in line to be chosen for the space programme but I didn't qualify.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,bridge,Kirk,,"Take a good look around, Captain. You made it here ahead of all of them."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,bridge,Sulu,,"Sir, our speed is increasing. We're travelling at over warp eight."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,bridge,Kirk,,Mister Spock.
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,bridge,Spock,,"Since we've passed Mercury, the sun's pull on us has increased greatly. From here, we'll move even faster. And Captain, notice the chronometers. They've started backward. Minute by minute, the speed of time passage will now increase."
21,1,Tomorrow is Yesterday,bridge,Kirk,,"Get your gear. Report to the transporter room. And Captain Christopher, you only have about fifteen years, so you'd better hurry."

22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,,Three older men turn in surprise.,
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Narrator,,KIRK; I'm sorry to break in on you like this. We didn't expect that kind of a welcome.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Tamar,,Welcome? You are strangers?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Kirk,,"Yes, that's right. We're from the valley."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Hacom,,You came for the Festival?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Kirk,,Yes.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Hacom,,Then how come you here?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Lindstrom,,Are you Reger?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Reger,,Yes.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Lindstrom,,You have a daughter named Tula.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Reger,,Yes.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Lindstrom,,"Well, you'd better do something. She's outside."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Reger,,I know. It's Festival. It's the will of Landru.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Hacom,,"Reger, these are young men. They are not old enough to be excused."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Reger,,They're visitors.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Hacom,,"Well, have they no Lawgivers in the Valley? Why be they not at the Festival?"
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Kirk,,We heard that you might have rooms for us.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Reger,,"There. You see, Hacom? They've merely come looking for a place to rest afterwards."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Hacom,,The Red Hour has already struck.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Tamar,,"Hacom, these be strangers. The Valley has different ways."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Hacom,,Do you say that Landru is not everywhere?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Tamar,,"No, of course not. It's simply they may have different ways."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Reger,,"They've come looking for shelter. Can I turn them away? Come, please."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Lindstrom,,"But the girl, out there."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Hacom,,"She is in festival, as you should be."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Reger,,"Come, please. Hurry."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,,He leads the way upstairs.,
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Hacom,,The Lawgivers should know.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Tamar,,"Surely, Hacom, they already know. Are they not infallible?"
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Hacom,,You mock them! You mock the Lawgivers. And the strangers are not of the Body. You will see.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Tamar,,"But, Hacom"
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,,Hacom leaves the house,
22,1,The Return of The Archons,room,,"Reger shows them into a sparsely furnished room with bunk beds, and turns up the gas light.",
22,1,The Return of The Archons,room,Reger,,You can return here at the close of the Festival. It's quiet. You'll have need of rest.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,room,Kirk,,"We have no plans to attend the Festival, sir."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,room,Reger,,The hour is struck. You can hear.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,room,Kirk,,"I'd like to hear more about this Festival, and Landru."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,room,Reger,alarmed,Landru? You ask? You're strange. You scorn Festival? Are you? Are you?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,room,Kirk,,What about Landru?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,room,,"Outside are scenes of rioting, willful destruction of property, random violence and lust. Reger leaves the group, unseen to us.",
22,1,The Return of The Archons,room,Rioter,,Festival! Festival!
22,1,The Return of The Archons,room,Kirk,,"Landru. My guess is we have until morning. Let's put the time to good use. Doctor, do atmospheric readings to determine whether there's anything in the air to account for all this. Mister Lindstrom, correlate all that you've seen with any other sociological parallels, if any."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,room,Narrator,,"Mister Spock, you and I have some serious thinking to do. When we leave here tomorrow morning, I want to have a plan of action."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,room,,"Kirk, as sixth man in the group, didn't get a bunk bed or chair to sleep on. When the town clock strikes 6 am, everybody outside stops and then goes on their placid way as if nothing had happened.",
22,1,The Return of The Archons,room,Kirk,,"Spock. Spock, Lindstrom. Doc."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,room,,"They hear crying outside, and go to investigate.",
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Reger,,"No, no it's all over now. It's all over now, child. That's all right. Quiet."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Mccoy,,Excuse me.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,,Leads the distressed Tula away,
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Reger,,It's all right. It's all over.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Kirk,,He'll give her a shot. It'll calm her down. Trust us.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Lindstrom,,You didn't even try to bring her back. What kind of father are you?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Reger,,It's Landru's will.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Kirk,,What about Landru? Who is he?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Tamar,,It is true then. You did not attend the Festival last night.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Kirk,,No.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,hallway,Reger,,Then you're not of the Body. You couldn't be.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Mccoy,,She's asleep.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Reger,,"Are you, are you Archons?"
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Kirk,,What if we are?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Reger,,It was said more would follow. If you are indeed
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Tamar,,We must hide them. Quickly. The Lawgivers.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Kirk,,We can take care of ourselves.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Tamar,,Landru will know. He will come.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,,Hacom storms in with two robed figures.,
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Hacom,,He is the one. He mocked the Lawgivers. I heard him.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Tamar,,"No, Hacom. It was a jest."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Hacom,,"The others, they were here, but they scorned the Festival. I saw it."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Lawgiver,,"Tamar, stand clear."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Tamar,,I hear and obey the voice of Landru.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,,The Lawgiver kills him with his hollow stave,
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Lawgiver,,You attacked the Body. You have heard the Word and disobeyed. You will be absorbed.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Kirk,,"What do you mean, absorbed?"
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Hacom,,"There, you see? Not of the body."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Lawgiver,,You will be absorbed. The Good is all. Landru is gentle. You will come.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Kirk,,We're not going anywhere.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Lawgiver,,It is the law. You must come.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Kirk,,I said we're not going anywhere.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,,The two lawgivers turn and face each other.,
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Spock,,Evidently they're not prepared to deal with out right disobedience. How did you know?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Kirk,,Everything we've seen here so far seems to indicate some sort of compulsive involuntary stimulus to action.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Spock,,Your analysis seems logical.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Lawgiver,,It is clear that you simply did not understand. I will re-phrase. You are ordered to accompany us to the absorption chambers.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Kirk,,Why did you kill that man?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Lawgiver,,Out of order. You will obey. It is the word of Landru.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Kirk,,You tell Landru that we'll come in our own time and that we'll speak to him.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,,"Kirk takes the stave from the lawgiver, and hands it to Spock for inspection.",
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Lawgiver,,You cannot. It is Landru.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Hacom,,Landru.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,,Hacom leaves quickly,
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Spock,,"Fascinating. This is merely a hollow tube, Captain. No mechanism."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Reger,,They're communing. We have time. Come with me.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Kirk,,Where to?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,drawing room,Reger,,"To a place I know. You'll be safe there, but we must hurry. Landru will come."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,,"They hurry slowly, smiling and bowing to passers by.",
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Kirk,,Quite a festival they had.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Reger,,Peace.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Kirk,,What do you make of all this?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Spock,,"Totally illogical. Yesterday, without apparent cause or reason, they wrought total havoc. Yet today, now"
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Kirk,,Now they're back to normal.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Bilar,,"Morning, friends."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,All,,"Good morning, Bilar."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Lindstrom,,Your daughter. That's the man.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Reger,,"No, it wasn't Bilar. It was Landru. Let's hurry, we haven't much time."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,,"But a few paces further on, the passers by all stop.",
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Reger,,It's too late. Look.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Kirk,,What is it?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Reger,,Landru. He's summoning the body.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Spock,,"Telepathy, Captain."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,,The people pick up weapons from the debris in the street.,
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Kirk,,"Phasers on stun. Which way, Reger?"
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Reger,,"Perhaps through there, but Landru"
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Kirk,,"We'll handle Landru, Just get us out of this."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,,They get trapped in an alley,
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Kirk,,I don't want to hurt them. Warn them back.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Reger,,They're in the Body. It's Landru.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Kirk,,"Phasers on stun, wide field. Fire."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,,"They drop the first wave, but more come.",
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Kirk,,Fire.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,,They get down the alley,
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Kirk,,Security.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Mccoy,,Captain.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Kirk,,Lieutenant O'Neil. He's one of our men.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Reger,,Not anymore. He's been absorbed.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Kirk,,Bring him along.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Reger,,"The Lieutenant is one of them. When he wakes, Landru will find us through him. Leave him there. He's our enemy. He's been absorbed."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Lindstrom,,"Captain, now that we've got Lieutenant O'Neil, let's beam up out of here."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,street,Kirk,,We still don't know what's happened to the Archons. Which way? Bring him along.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,,"Reger leads them into a building made of massive stones. He goes over to a corner and unwraps a flat panel, which gives off light.",
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Mccoy,,Put him over there.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Kirk,,A lighting panel.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Spock,,Amazing in this culture.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Reger,,Comes from a time before Landru.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Kirk,,Before Landru? How long ago was that?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Reger,,Nobody knows positively. Some say as long ago as six thousand years.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Spock,,It took a very advanced technology to construct a device like this. Inconsistent with this environment
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Kirk,,But not inconsistent with what we've seen. Security.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,,The two spare members of the group go to stand guard.,
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Kirk,,"Those staffs. Hollow tubes. Antennae for some sort of broadcast power. What is it, Mister Spock?"
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Spock,,"Strong power generations, Captain. Near here, but radiating in all directions."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Mccoy,,"He'll be coming around soon, Captain."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Reger,,He must not. He's been absorbed.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Kirk,,Absorbed?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Reger,,"The Body absorbs its enemies. It only kills when it has to. When the first Archons came, they were free, out of control, opposing the will of Landru. Many were killed, many more were absorbed. When he regains consciousness, Landru will find us through him. And if the others come"
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Kirk,,What others?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Reger,,"Those like you and me, who resist Landru."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Spock,,An underground? How are you organised?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Reger,,"In threes. Myself, Tamar, who's dead now, and one other."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Kirk,,Who?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Reger,,I don't know. Tamar was my contact.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Mccoy,,"Give me a decision, Captain. He's coming out of it."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Reger,,He must not regain consciousness. He'll destroy us all. He's of the Body.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Kirk,,"Give him a shot. Keep him asleep. Reger, I want some answers. This underground. If Landru is so powerful, how do you survive?"
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Reger,,"I don't know, Captain. Some of us escape the directives. Not many, but a few. It was that way when the first Archons came."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Kirk,,The Archons. Tell me about them.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Reger,,"They had invaded the Body, but they resisted the will of Landru. You see, Landru had pulled them down from the skies."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Kirk,,"Pulled them down from the skies? A starship? Mister Spock, those power readings you took, are they?"
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Spock,,Powerful enough to destroy a starship? Affirmative.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Kirk,,"Kirk to Enterprise, come in."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,bridge,Scott,,"Captain, we're under attack. There are heat beams of some kind coming up from the planet surface."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,bridge,Kirk,,Status report.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,bridge,Scott,,"Our shields are holding, but they're taking all our power."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Scott,,"If we try to warp out or move on impulse, we'll lose our shields and burn up like a cinder."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Kirk,,Orbit condition.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,bridge,Scott,,"Checking. We're going down, Captain. Unless we can get those beams off us so we can use our engines, we're due to hit atmosphere in less than twelve hours."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Kirk,,Keep your shield up. Do everything you can to maintain orbit. We'll try and locate the source of the beam and stop it here.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Scott,,Impossible to break away. I've tried the emergency bypass circuits but they haven't been effective.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,,The conversation ends in a crackle of static.,
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Spock,,Captain.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Kirk,,What is it?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Spock,,"Sensor beams, very strong. We're being probed. In this direction."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Reger,,Landru.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Spock,,Block them out.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Spock,,"Too strong, Captain. Can't be blocked."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Reger,adopting a prayerful posture,Oh.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,,"The image of a tall, elegant man draped in robes appears against a wall.",
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Landru,,I am Landru.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Spock,,"Projection, Captain. Unreal."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Kirk,,"But beautiful, Mister Spock, with no apparatus at this end."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Landru,,You have come as destroyers. You bring an infection.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Kirk,,You are holding my ship. I demand that you release it.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Landru,,"You have come to a world without hate, without fear, without conflict. No war, no disease, no crime. None of the ancient evils. Landru seeks tranquillity. Peace for all. The universal good."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Kirk,,We mean you no harm. Ours is a mission of peace and good will.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Landru,,The good must transcend the evil. It shall be done. So it has been since the beginning.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Spock,,"He doesn't hear you, Captain."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Lindstrom,drawing his phaser,Maybe he'll hear this.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Kirk,,"Put that away. Landru, listen to me."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Landru,,"You will be absorbed. Your individuality will merge into the unity of the good, and in your submergence into the common being of the Body, you will find contentment and fulfillment. You will experience the absolute good."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Reger,,Oh.
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,,"A sound permeates the room, and knocks everyone out.",
22,1,The Return of The Archons,chamber,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 3157.4. The Enterprise, still under attack by some sort of heat rays from the surface of Beta Three, is now being commanded by Engineering Officer Scott. The shore party has been taken by the creature called Landru."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,prison,,"Kirk wakes up in a chamber very like the previous one, constructed of large stone blocks, but without the furniture. A stone door has no handle on the inside. His communicator and phaser are gone.",

22,1,The Return of The Archons,prison,Kirk,,Where is here?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,prison,Spock,,Evidently a maximum security establishment. Are you armed?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,prison,Kirk,,No. All our phasers are gone. I checked. That's locked.

22,1,The Return of The Archons,prison,Spock,,"Sound waves. Stronger, they might have killed us. As it was, they merely rendered us unconscious."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,prison,Kirk,,Enough analysis. Let's think of a way to get out of here. What about the Lawgivers' inability to cope with the unexpected?
22,1,The Return of The Archons,prison,Spock,,"We shouldn't depend on that happening again, Captain. In a society as well organised as this one seems to be, I cannot conceive of such an oversight going uncorrected. Interesting, however. Their reaction to your defiance was remarkably similar to the reaction of a computer when fed insufficient or contradictory data."
22,1,The Return of The Archons,prison,Kirk,,"Are you suggesting the Lawgivers are mere computers, that they aren't human?"
22,1,The Return of The Archons,prison,Spock,,"Quite human, Captain. It's simply that all the facts are not yet in. There are gaps."

23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Kirk,,Are you sure?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Uhura,,Positive. It repeats over and over.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,Is that supposed to mean something?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Kirk,,Code seven-ten means under no circumstances are we to approach that planet. No circumstances what so ever.

23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,"Captain, in the past twenty years, thousands of lives have been lost in this quadrant. Lives that could have been saved if the Federation had a treaty port here. We mean to have that port and I'm here to get it."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Kirk,,"By disregarding code seven-ten, you might well involve us in an interplanetary war."

23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,"I have my orders, Captain, and now you have yours. You will proceed on course. Achieve orbit status and just leave the rest to me. You're well aware that my mission gives me the power of command. I now exercise it. You will proceed on course. That's a direct order."

23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Spock,,"In view of code seven-ten, Captain, may I suggest"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, Mister Spock. This is the Captain. Condition Yellow Alert. Phaser crews stand by. Deflector shields up. We're going in. Peacefully, I hope. But peacefully or not, we're going in."

23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Mea,,"It was for your own safety, Captain."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Kirk,,I see no danger here.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Mea,,"The danger exists. Nevertheless, you are here. It would be morally incorrect to do less than extend our hospitality. Anan 7 and members of the High Council await you. If you will come this way, please."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,,Five stern looking men sit along a table facing the door.,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,"I'm Captain Kirk. This is my first officer, Mister Spock, Lieutenants Galloway, Osborne, Yeoman Tamula."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"Welcome to Eminiar Seven. Well, Captain, what can we do for you?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,My mission is to establish diplomatic relations between your people and mine.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,That is impossible.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,Would you mind telling me why?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,Because of the war.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,You're still at war?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,We have been at war for five hundred years.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,You conceal it very well. Mister Spock?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Spock,,"Sir, we have completely scanned your planet. We find it highly advanced, prosperous in a material sense, comfortable for your people, and peaceful in the extreme. Yet you say you are at war. There is no evidence of this."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"Casualties among our civilian population total from one to three million dead each year from direct enemy attack. That is one reason, Captain, why we told you to stay away. As long as your ship is orbiting our planet, it is in severe danger."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Spock,,With whom are you at war?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"The third planet in our system, called Vendikar. Originally settled by our people and now a ruthless enemy. Highly advanced technologically."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,,An alarm sounds.,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"Please excuse me. Vendikar is attacking. Mea, care for our guests."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,,The Council adjourn into an adjacent room filled with computer equipment.,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Spock,,Strange.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,To say the least.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Mea,,It will not last long.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,Don't you take shelter?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Mea,,"There is no shelter, Captain."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Spock,,Are these attacks frequent?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Mea,,"Oh yes, and we will retaliate immediately."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,,She sees an area flare on a map,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Mea,,Oh!
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,What is it?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Mea,,A hit right here in the city.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,"Do you hear any explosions, Mister Spock?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Spock,,"None, Captain. Yeoman Tamula."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Tamula,,Sir?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Spock,,Tricorder readings. Radiation. Disturbances of any kind.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,,She scans the area,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Tamula,,"Working, sir. No evidence."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,"Mea, if this is an attack, may I ask what weapons the enemy is using?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Mea,,"Fusion bombs, materialised by the enemy over their targets."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,Kirk to Bridge. Scotty?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Scott,,"Scott here, Captain."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,Scanners operative on the planet's surface?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Scott,,"Of course, sir. As per orders."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,Anything unusual?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Scott,,"Nothing, sir. All quiet."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,Thank you. Kirk out.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,Sar,,"Look, Anan. (another flare on another screen)"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,Anan,,"Yes, I see it. They were warned."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,Sar,,Just as it happened fifty years ago.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,Anan,,Alert a security detachment. They may be needed.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,,Anan rejoins the group,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"It's a vicious attack, extremely destructive. Fortunately, our defences are firming, but our casualties are high. Very high."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,"Sir, I have been in contact with my ship, which has had this entire planet under surveillance. All during this so-called attack of yours, we have been monitoring you. There's been no attack, no explosions, no radiations, no disturbances whatsoever. If this is some sort of game you're playing"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"This is no game, Captain. Half a million people have just been killed. Activate the attack units, Sar."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Sar,,"Yes, Councilman."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,Launch immediate counter attack.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Spock,,"Computers, Captain. They fight their war with computers. Totally."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"Yes, of course."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,Computer don't kill a half million people.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,Deaths have been registered. Of course they have twenty four hours to report.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,To report?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"To our disintegration machines. You must understand, Captain, we have been at war for five hundred years. Under ordinary conditions, no civilisation could withstand that. But we have reached a solution."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Spock,,Then the attack by Vendikar was theoretical.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"Oh, no, quite real. An attack is mathematically launched. I lost my wife in the last attack. Our civilisation lives. The people die, but our culture goes on."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,You mean to tell me your people just walk into a disintegration machine when they're told to?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"We have a high consciousness of duty, Captain."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Spock,,There is a certain scientific logic about it.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,I'm glad you approve.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Spock,,I do not approve. I understand.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"Good. Then you will recall I warned you not to come here. You chose to ignore my warning. I'm sorry, but it's happened."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,What has happened?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"Once your ship was in orbit about our planet, it became a legitimate target. It has been classified destroyed by a tricobalt satellite explosion. All persons aboard your ship have twenty four hours to report to our disintegration machines. In order to ensure their co-operation, I have ordered you, Captain, and your party held in custody until they surrender. If possible, we shall spare your ship, Captain, but its passengers and crew are already dead."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Narrator,,"Captain's log, delayed. The Enterprise, in orbit about Eminiar Seven, has been declared a casualty of an incredible war fought by computers. I and my landing party, though apparently not included as casualties aboard the Enterprise, are confined on the planet's surface, awaiting what?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Mea,,I have been sent to ask if you require anything.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,We require a great deal. I wish to speak to Anan Seven.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Mea,,He's busy co-ordinating casualty lists.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,He'll have more casualty lists than he knows what to do with if he doesn't get in here and talk to me.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Mea,,Don't you understand? Our duty
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,Your duty doesn't include stepping into a disintegrator and disappearing.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Mea,,"I'm afraid mine does, Captain. I too have been declared a casualty. I must report to a disintegrator by noon tomorrow."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,Is that all it means to you? To report and die?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Mea,,"My life is as dear to me as yours is to you, Captain."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,Then how can you stand
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Mea,,"Don't you see? If I refuse to report, and others refuse, then Vendikar would have no choice but to launch real weapons. We would have to do the same to defend ourselves. More than people would die then. A whole civilisation would be destroyed. Surely you can see that ours is a better way."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,"No, I don't see that at all."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Mea,,It's been our way for almost five hundred years. Is there anything I can bring you?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,Yes. Anan Seven.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Mccoy,,"I tell you, we should have heard something by now."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, Doctor, that we should, but we haven't, and we cannot raise them. You know, if there'd been trouble, they should have at least managed to get word back to us."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Mccoy,,We can't just sit here.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,What would you suggest?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Mccoy,,"Me? I'm a doctor. If I were an officer of the line, I'd"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,Would you have me open fire?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Mccoy,,Of course not.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Uhura,,"Mister Scott, message coming in from the Captain."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"Scott here, Captain."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Kirk,,"Good news, Mister Scott. The Eminians have agreed to the establishment of full normal diplomatic relations."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,Mister Fox'll be glad to hear about that.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Kirk,,"They've also extended an invitation to all personnel to come ashore, for shore leave. They've assured me that our people will have a wonderful time."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"Er, Captain?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,,"It sounds like Kirk but it isn't.) ANAN: Yes, Mister Scott",
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,Scott,,All personnel?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,Anan,,"All personnel. We'll transport up trained Eminians to assume support positions. Those are my orders, Mister Scott."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, aye, Captain. We'll start forming shore parties immediately. Scott out. Well now, what do you think of that?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Mccoy,,I don't know.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"Well, I do. Computer, last message received and recorded from Captain Kirk."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Computer,,In place.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,Run it through analyser. Question. Is it or is it not the Captain's voice?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Computer,,Negative. A close copy.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,A voice duplicator?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Computer,,Ninety eight percent probability.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"Well, they've got them, Doctor, and now they're trying to get us."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,"Are you sure you can do it, Mister Spock?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Spock,,"Limited telepathic abilities are inherent in Vulcanians, Captain. It may work. It may not."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,Do your best.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,,"Spock goes to the door and begins to slowly work his way across it. Outside, the guard starts to blink and shake his head. Spock reaches the place directly behind the guard and looks as if he is doing a mind meld through the wall. Slowly, the guard opens the door and enters. He is swiftly disarmed and knocked out.",
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,"Thank you, Mister Spock."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Spock,,"My pleasure, Captain."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Tamula,,"What do we do now, Captain?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,"We get our communicators back and try and contact the ship. Mister Spock, we'll need more weapons."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Spock,,I understand.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,"We'll try to take it easy, but if we're forced to kill"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,,"As holder of the only gun, Kirk leads the way into the corridors of the city.",
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,,"At a junction, they watch as first a young woman, then a security guard go into a booth.",
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Spock,,"An entrance, Captain, but no exit. They go in, but they do not come out."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Kirk,,A disintegration machine.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Spock,,So I would assume.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,,They move forward carefully and meet - ,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Kirk,,Mea. What do you think you're doing?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Mea,,I'm going
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Kirk,,You're not going in there.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Mea,,But I must.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Kirk,,No you're not.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Mea,,"Please. All right, don't worry about me."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, that guard. I'll cover you."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,,Spock walks nonchalantly up to the guard in charge of disintegrating the waiting queue of people.,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Spock,,"Sir, there's a multi-legged creature crawling on your shoulder."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,,"He neck-pinches him, as the rest just stare. They now have two weapons. Spock rejoins Kirk.",
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Kirk,,"All right, you people, clear out of the way."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,,Kirk fires at the booth.,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Mea,,What are you doing?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Kirk,,Throwing a monkey wrench into the machinery.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Mea,,You can't do this.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Kirk,,"I've done it. (The booth finally blows up.) Come on, let's get out of here."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Security,,"The Federation prisoners have attacked their guard and escaped. They are armed. Disintegration station number twelve destroyed, Councilman, apparently by disruptor fire."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"All security personnel, Federation prisoners have escaped. They are to be found. They are armed. If they resist, do what is necessary. Planetary disruptor banks, calculate orbit of star cruiser now circling. Stand by to fire. Full power."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Security,,"Councilman, planetary disruptor banks locked onto target. Standing by."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"In ten seconds, open fire. Destroy the star cruiser. Those are the orders of the Council."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Narrator,,"Ship's log, stardate 3193.0. Chief Engineer Scott recording. The Captain and First Officer are overdue and missing on the surface of Eminiar Seven. I have taken standard precautionary measures while we continue our attempts to locate them."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Depaul,,All stations reporting. Deflector screens rigged at full power. Phaser crews ready. Sensors reading zero. Correction. Mister Scott.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"Yes, Mister DePaul?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Depaul,,Sensor readings just shot off the scale.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"Well, now. They're taking pot shots at us. Holding, Mister DePaul?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Depaul,,"Screens firm, sir. Extremely powerful sonic vibrations. Decibels eighteen to the twelfth power. If those screens weren't up, we'd be totally disrupted by now."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, I guess that answers our questions, Mister Scott. They're not very friendly, are they?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, but what about our Captain and the landing party down there somewhere?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Mccoy,,We get them out.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"If they're alive, and if we can find them. That's a big planet."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Mccoy,,Not too big for the Enterprise to handle if it has to.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"We can't fire full phasers with our screens up, and We can't lower our screens with their disruptors on us. Of course I could treat them to a few dozen photon torpedoes."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,entering the Bridge,"You'll do no such thing, Mister Scott."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"Mister Fox, we're under attack. They're trying to knock us down."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,You have taken defensive measures.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"Of course, but"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,"There are no buts. Obviously it's a misunderstanding, and one of my jobs is to clear up misunderstandings."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Mccoy,,They're holding our Captain.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,We have no proof of that.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,I'm responsible for the safety of this ship.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,"And I'm responsible for the success of this mission, and that's more important than this ship. Is that clear? We came here to establish diplomatic relations with these people."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"But they're the ones who're looking for a fight, Mister Fox."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,"This is a diplomatic matter. If you check your regulations, you'll find that my orders get priority. I'll try to make contact with the planetary officials. Lieutenant, open up a channel and keep it open. Tell them to expect a priority one message from me. There will be no punitive measures, gentlemen. Those are my orders."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,,He leaves the Bridge.,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,Diplomats. The best diplomat I know is a fully activated phaser bank.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Tamula,,"Why did we come back here, Captain?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,The last place they'll look for us is the place we escaped from. (gives her a gun) Cover the door.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Mea,,"Captain, you've got to let me go. My time is almost up."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,Are you that anxious to die?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Mea,,You don't understand.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, how did that little raid work out?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Spock,,"We captured four of their disrupter-type weapons, two complete outfits of male clothing, and perhaps most important of all, one of their communication devices."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,Will it reach the ship?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Spock,,"Not at this time. Its range is restricted in comparison with ours. I may be able to alter its components, but it will take time."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,"Work on it. We've got to contact the ship. Mea, I want you to give me a complete layout of this building complex. How do I get to the War Room?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Mea,,No!
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,"Now listen to me. I'm trying to help you. To save your life and the lives of millions like you. If you help me, maybe I can do it. If you don't, you'll die, we'll die, and the killing will go on. Or are you that fond of the war?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Mea,,What are you going to do?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,We're going to try and stop the killing. We're trying to help. Believe me.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Mea,,"I believe you, but"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Kirk,,Tell me what I want to know. Please.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,Time is running out. We have been unable to destroy the Earth ship. One of our disintegration chambers has been eliminated and we have already fallen far behind in our quota. This is a grave crisis and I am at a loss to know how to proceed.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Sar,,"The central channel, Anan. The Earth ambassador's calling with an urgent message."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"What is the great immorality, open honesty or a deception which may save our lives? Put me through to the Earth Ambassador."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Uhura,,"A channel is open, Mister Ambassador. You will be speaking to Anan Seven, head of the High Council of the Eminian Union."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,"Mister Anan, this is Robert Fox"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Fox,,Special Ambassador for the United Federation of Planets.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"A great honour, Mister Ambassador."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,We have approached you openly
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Fox,,"With the intent of establishing formal and friendly relations between our peoples, but now,"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,"For some reason, you have attacked us, and apparently you're holding several special representatives of our Federation."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"A mistake, Mister Ambassador. We are at war."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Anan,,An error in our sensors indicated that your ship was about to attack us.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,I'm giving orders that our attack be stopped.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Anan,,"Now, as to your representatives, you have my sacred word as an Eminian that they are alive and well."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,Thank you. I thought perhaps it was all a mistake.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Depaul,,"Mister Scott, disruptor beams are no longer hitting us."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"Maintain status, Mister DePaul."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Anan,,"We are most anxious to establish relations with you, Mister Fox."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"We will make arrangements to receive you. (to Sar, closing the channel) The minute their screens are down, open fire."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Sar,,"Yes, Councilman."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,reopening the channel,"I apologise deeply for the misunderstanding. These are trying times for us, you understand."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,"I understand. Mister Anan, I presume that you have our ship's Captain on hand when I beam down."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"He will be there, sir."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Anan,,I give you my word.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,"I'm sure that from this day forward, your planet and our Federation will attain the deepest friendship. I look forward to seeing you."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,,He gestures to Uhura to end transmission.,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,"Diplomacy, gentlemen, should be a job left to diplomats. You will, of course, immediately resume a peaceful status."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"No, sir, I will not."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,What did you say?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"I'll not lower the screens, not until the Captain tells me to."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,You are taking orders from me. You will lower the screens as a sign of good faith. My authority.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"I know about your authority, but the screens stay up."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Mccoy,,"Mister Fox, they faked a message from the Captain, they've launched an attack against our ship. Now you want us to trust them openly?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,I want you and expect you to obey my lawful orders.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"No, sir. I won't lower the screens."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,Your refusal to comply with my orders has endangered the entire success of this mission. I can have you sent to a penal colony for this.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"That you can, sir, but I won't lower the screens."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Fox,,Your name will figure prominently in my report to the Federation Central.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,,Fox leaves the Bridge,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, Scotty, now you've done it."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"Aye. The haggis is in the fire for sure, but I'll not lower my defences on the word of that mealy-mouthed gentleman down below. Not until I know what happened to the Captain."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,,"Kirk enters, quietly, but Anan knows he is there without turning around.",
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Anan,,"Won't you join me in a drink, Captain? You'll find our trova most interesting."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Kirk,,I didn't come to drink.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Anan,,I assume that is what you used to destroy disintegration chamber number twelve.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Kirk,,A very efficient weapon. I'm not afraid of using it.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Anan,,My first impression was correct. You are a barbarian.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Kirk,,I am?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Anan,,"Don't sound so incredulous, Captain. Of course you are. We all are. A killer first, a builder second. A hunter, a warrior, and let's be honest, a murderer. That is our joint heritage, is it not?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Kirk,,We're less cold-blooded about it than you are.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Anan,,"What do you want, Captain?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Kirk,,I want to contact my ship. Where are my communicators?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Anan,,In a safe place.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Kirk,,"You take a lot of chances, Councilman."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Anan,,"You're worried about your ship, Captain. I'm trying to save a world."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Kirk,,"If I were you, I'd think about saving my life."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Anan,,"Won't you have a drink, Captain?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,,"Kirk pours himself a slug of trova, and as he turns his back, Anan presses concealed buttons.",
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Anan,,And then we can discuss our differences.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Kirk,,"I'm not interested in discussing our differences. You don't seem to realise the risk you're taking. We don't make war with computers and herd the casualties into suicide stations. We make the real thing, Councilman. I could destroy this planet."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Anan,,Why do you think I don't let you talk to your ship ?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Kirk,,I don't need the ship for that.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Anan,,"You mean, all by yourself with a disruptor, you can destroy this planet?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Kirk,,That's exactly what I mean.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Anan,,I had no idea you were so formidable.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Kirk,,You seem to think I'm joking. Where are the communicators?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Anan,,"If I told you, Captain, would you walk right out and get them?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Kirk,,Something like that.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,anan's room,Anan,,"Very well, Captain. They're in the War Room. Go left down the corridor, left again. They are unguarded."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,,"Kirk gestures Anan to leave in front of him, and pushes him into the first guard outside the door. Then Kirk tackles the second guard, but finally the pair knock him out.",
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Anan,,Is he alive? Pity. Man like that would have preferred to die fighting. Take him to the Council Room.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,,Kirk is half-dragged away,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,eminiar seven,,Fox and his aide beam down to exactly the same place as the original landing party.,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,eminiar seven,Anan,,Ambassador Fox?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,eminiar seven,Fox,,I am Robert Fox. Have I the honour of addressing Anan Seven?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,eminiar seven,Anan,,"Welcome to Eminiar, Mister Ambassador."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Anan,,"Mister Ambassador, I am truly sorry for what must happen."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Fox,,I beg your pardon?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Anan,,You and your party have been declared war casualties. You will be taken immediately to one of our casualty stations so that your deaths may be recorded.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Fox,,You mean we are to be killed?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Anan,,"That is correct, Mister Ambassador. I regret it very much, but there is nothing I can do about it."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,,"The two security guards are in Eminian uniform and look like something out of Thunderbirds - the puppet show, that is.",
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Spock,,"Spock to Enterprise, come in."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Uhura,,"Mister Scott, it's Mister Spock."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"Scotty here, Mister Spock. Go ahead."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Spock,,Is the ship all right?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Scott,,"We've been through a bit, but we're all right now. How about the Captain and you?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Spock,,The Captain is overdue. We've suffered no casualties among us. This is important. Under no circumstances shall any one beam down from the Enterprise. They'd be killed the moment they arrived.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,That ties it. That popinjay Fox went down a couple minutes ago.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Spock,,The Ambassador?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,I knew it had a rotten ring to it.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Spock,,Orbit out to maximum phaser range and stand by for further orders. Spock out.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Tamula,,"What are you going to do, Mister Spock?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Spock,,"Find the Ambassador and the Captain. Yeoman Tamula, you stay here and prevent this young lady from immolating herself. Knock her down if necessary. This is a killing situation. Do what you must to protect yourself. Clear?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,room,Tamula,,"Yes, sir."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,disintegration chamber,,A guard is trying to force Fox inside when Spock and the two guards arrive.,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,disintegration chamber,Fox,,What are you doing? I'm a representative of the United Federation of Planets! A special representative!
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,disintegration chamber,Guard,,Get in line.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,disintegration chamber,,They disarm and disable the Eminian guards,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,disintegration chamber,Fox,,Spock!
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,disintegration chamber,Spock,,"Please, Mister Fox. Ladies and gentlemen, please move quickly away from the chamber or you may be injured."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,disintegration chamber,Fox,,"What are you doing, Mister Spock?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,disintegration chamber,Spock,,"Practicing a peculiar variety of diplomacy, sir."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,disintegration chamber,,He uses the disrupter to destroy the disintegration chamber,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,disintegration chamber,Spock,,"I'll take you to a place of comparative safety, then I must find the Captain."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,disintegration chamber,Fox,,They have him. The guards told us. They took him to the Council Room under heavy guard.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,disintegration chamber,Spock,,"By now, Mister Ambassador, I'm sure you realise that normal diplomatic procedures are ineffective here."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,disintegration chamber,Fox,,"I've never been a soldier, Mister Spock, but I learn very quickly."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,disintegration chamber,Spock,,"Very well, sir. We need all the help we can get."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"Captain, surely you can see the position we are in. If your people do not report to our disintegration chambers, it is a violation of an agreement that dates back five hundred years."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,My people are not responsible for your agreements.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"You will be responsible for an escalation that will destroy everything. Millions of people horribly killed. Complete destruction of our culture here and yes, the culture on Vendikar. Disaster, disease, starvation, horrible, lingering death, pain and anguish!"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,That seems to frighten you.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,It would frighten any sane man.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,Yes. You're quite right.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"Don't you understand, Captain? We have done away with all that. Now you are threatening to bring it down on us again. Are those five hundred people of yours more important than the hundreds of millions of innocent people on Eminiar and Vendikar? What kind of monster are you?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,I'm a barbarian. You said it yourself.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,I had hoped I'd spoken only figuratively.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,"Oh, no. You were quite accurate. I plan to prove it to you."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"Open a channel to the Enterprise. You give me no choice, Captain. We are not bandits, but you force us to act as bandits."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Scott,,This is the USS Enterprise.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,"Scotty, General Order Twenty Four. Two hours! In two hours!"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"Enterprise, this is Anan Seven, First Councilman of the High Council of Eminiar."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Anan,,"We hold your Captain, his party, your Ambassador and his party prisoners."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"Unless you immediately start transportation of all personnel aboard your ship to the surface, the hostages will be killed. You have thirty minutes. I mean it, Captain."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,All that it means is that I won't be around for the destruction. You heard me give General Order Twenty Four. That means in two hours the Enterprise will destroy Eminiar Seven.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"Planetary defence System, open fire on the Enterprise!"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Security,,"I'm sorry, Councilman. The target has moved out of range."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,You wouldn't do this. Hundreds of millions of people.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,"I didn't start it, Councilman, but I'm liable to finish it."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,,Meanwhile Spock and his group are moving through the corridors. Fox's aide gets injured in one weapons exchange so they leave him behind.,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Sar,,"Councilman, I received a message from Vendikar. Our time is nearly up. Our quota is short by several thousand. They accuse us of reneging on the treaty."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,You see? It's started.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,You're wrong. It hasn't begun.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Security,,"Councilman, Disintegrator station eleven has been destroyed. Guard positions in tunnels eight and ten fail to answer. Earth party reported seen in corridor 4A."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,"You have less than two hours, Councilman."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,What I want or don't want has nothing to do with it. Escalation is automatic. You can stop it!
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,Stop it? I'm counting on it.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"Open a channel, Lieutenant. This is the commander of the USS Enterprise."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Scott,,"All cities and installations on Eminiar Seven have been located, identified, and fed into our fire-control system. In one hour and forty five minutes"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,The entire inhabited surface of your planet will be destroyed.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Scott,,You have that long to surrender your hostages.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Anan,,"What can I do? Somebody, please tell me."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,,"Kirk lures a guard to him, knocks him down, gets his weapon and holds off the others.",
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,"Hold it! Over there. You, over there. Move, move, move."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,,"Everyone goes over against a wall, while Kirk gets a second weapon and stands by the council table.",
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,Now we'll talk.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,,Spock and Fox enter.,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Spock,,I had assumed you needed help. I see I'm in error.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,"No. I need the help. In there, Mister Spock."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,,Spock enters the War Room,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,"Kirk to Enterprise. Come in, Scotty."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Scott,,"Aye, Captain, are you all right?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,"Everything's secure here. Maintain position. If everything goes according to plan, you can beam us up in ten minutes. If you don't hear from us, carry out General Order Twenty Four on schedule."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Scott,,"Aye, aye, Captain. Is there anything else we can do?"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,"Cross your fingers. Kirk out. Death, destruction, disease, horror. That's what war is all about, Anan. That's what makes it a thing to be avoided. You've made it neat and painless. So neat and painless, you've had no reason to stop it. And you've had it for five hundred years. Since it seems to be the only way I can save my crew and my ship, I'm going to end it for you, one way or another. Mister Ambassador."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Fox,,"Yes, Captain."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,,Would you mind taking these people out into the corridor and holding them there.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Fox,,"Gentlemen, if you please."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,council room,Kirk,to Sar,You. Come with me. Mister Osborne.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,Kirk,,"Our communicators, weapons."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,,Sar opens a cupboard and Osborne gets them.,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,Kirk,,"All right, Mister Spock."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,Spock,,"These are the attack computers, Captain. That one's defence, that one computes the casualties. They're all tied in with a subspace transmission unit, which keeps them in constant contact with their Vendikan counterparts."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,Kirk,,"Yes, go on."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,Spock,,"At the moment contact is broken, it abrogates the agreement between the two warring parties."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,Sar,,What are you going to do?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,Spock,,"This one's the key. The circuit is now locked. Destroy this one, and they'll all go."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,Kirk,,Good. Get him out of here.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,Sar,,"Now wait a minute. Please, please!"
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,,Kirk uses his phaser to destroy the computer.,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,war room,Kirk,,Let's go.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Kirk,,Against the wall!
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,,There is a very satisfying series of explosions.,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Anan,,You realise what you have done?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Kirk,,"Yes, I do. I've given you back the horrors of war. The Vendikans now assume that you've broken your agreement and that you're preparing to wage real war with real weapons. They'll want do the same. Only the next attack they launch will do a lot more than count up numbers in a computer. They'll destroy cities, devastate your planet. You of course will want to retaliate. If I were you, I'd start making bombs. Yes, Councilman, you have a real war on your hands. You can either wage it with real weapons, or you might consider an alternative. Put an end to it. Make peace."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Anan,,There can be no peace. Don't you see? We've admitted it to ourselves. We're a killer species. It's instinctive. It's the same with you. Your General Order Twenty Four.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Kirk,,"All right. It's instinctive. But the instinct can be fought. We're human beings with the blood of a million savage years on our hands, but we can stop it. We can admit that we're killers, but we're not going to kill today. That's all it takes. Knowing that we won't kill today. Contact Vendikar. I think you'll find that they're just as terrified, appalled, horrified as you are, that they'll do anything to avoid the alternative I've given you. Peace or utter destruction. It's up to you."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Fox,,"As a third party interested only in peace and the establishment of normal relations, I should be glad to offer my services as negotiator between you and Vendikar. I've had some small experiences in such matters."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Anan,,There may be a chance. We have a direct channel with Vendikar's High Council. It hasn't been used in centuries.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Fox,,Then it's long overdue. Shall we go?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,,Anan and Fox leave.,
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Spock,,"There's a chance it may work, Captain."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty?
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Scott,,"Scott here, Captain."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,corridor,Kirk,,Cancel implementation of General Order Twenty Four. Alert transporter room. We're ready to beam up.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Kirk,,"Lay in a course for Argona Two, Navigator. Mister Scott."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Scott,,"Space details set, Captain."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Uhura,,"Message from Eminiar Seven, Captain. Ambassador Fox reports negotiations underway with Vendikar. Outlook hopeful."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Kirk,,Good.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, you took a big chance."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Kirk,,"Did I, Mister Spock? They've been killing three million people a year. It had been going on for five hundred years. An actual attack wouldn't have killed any more people than one of their computer attacks, but it would have ended their ability to make war. The fighting would have been over permanently."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Mccoy,,But you didn't know that it would work.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Kirk,,"No. It was a calculated risk. Still, the Eminians keep a very orderly society, and actual war is a very messy business. A very, very messy business. I had a feeling that they would do anything to avoid it, even talk peace."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Spock,,A feeling is not much to go on.
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Kirk,,"Sometimes a feeling, Mister Spock, is all we humans have to go on."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, you almost make me believe in luck."
23,1,A Taste of Armageddon,bridge,Kirk,,"Why, Mister Spock, you almost make me believe in miracles."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Spinelli,,"Coming up on it fast, sir."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,Are you certain of your sensor readings?
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Spock,,Definitely a space vessel of some type.
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,Origin?
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Spock,,Unknown. It could hardly be an Earth ship. There have been no flights into this sector for years.
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Uhura,,"I'm picking up a signal, sir. (a series of beeps comes over the speakers) Captain, that's the old Morse code call signal."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,Thank you.
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Uhura,,CQ. CQ.
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,"We're reading it, Lieutenant. I thought you said it couldn't possibly be an Earth vessel."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Spock,,I fail to understand why it always gives you pleasure to see me proven wrong.
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,An emotional Earth weakness of mine. There it is.
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,,The ship appears on the viewscreen.,
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,"An old Earth vessel, similar to the DY=500 class."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Spock,,"Much older. DY-100 class, to be exact. Captain, the last such vessel was built centuries ago, back in the 1990s."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,"Then it's a derelict, its signal left on automatic."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Spock,,Or an old Earth ship being used by aliens.
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,Weapons status.
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Weapons,,"Deflector shields on maximum. Phasers manned, sir."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,Bioscanners report.
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Mccoy,,"Life science bioscanners are picking up heart beats from over there. Can't be human, though. They're too faint, and average only four beats per minute."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Spock,,"Sensor reading, Captain. Some sort of equipment functioning on that vessel."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,All decks go to full alert.
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,,"Enterprise comes alongside the smaller ship, which is still as big as the engineering hull",
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 3141.9. A full hour has elapsed since interception of the strange vessel. Our presence alongside is still being completely ignored. Although our sensors continue to show signs of equipment and life aboard, there has been no indication of danger to us."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,"Weapons department, maintain battle stations. All other decks standby alert."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Uhura,,"All decks acknowledging, sir."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Mccoy,,"We're continuing to pick up some form of heart action over there. Very faint, very slow. Seems to be coming from about sixty or seventy bodies, as near as I can tell."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,"Alien bodies, Bones?"
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Mccoy,,Could be. There's no sign of breathing or other form of respiration.
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Spock,,"Hull surface is pitted with meteor scars. However, scanners make out a name. SS Botany Bay."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,Then you can check the registry.
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Spock,,"No such vessel listed. Records of that period are fragmentary, however. The mid=1990s was the era of your last so-called World War."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Mccoy,,The Eugenics Wars.
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Spock,,Of course. Your attempt to improve the race through selective breeding.
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Mccoy,,"Now, wait a minute. Not our attempt, Mister Spock. A group of ambitious scientists. I'm sure you know the type. Devoted to logic, completely unemotional"
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,"All right, all right, gentlemen. As you were. Rig for tractor beam, Helm. Lock onto that vessel."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Spinelli,,"Rigging for tractor beam, sir."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,"The Bridge is yours, Mister Spock. Care to join the landing party, Doctor?"
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, if you're actually giving me a choice"
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,"I'm not. Oh, I'll need somebody familiar with the late 20th-Century Earth. Here's a chance for that historian to do something for a change. What's her name? McIvers?"
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Spock,,Lieutenant McGivers.

24,1,Space Seed,mcgiver's quarters,Marla,,McGivers. On my way.
24,1,Space Seed,transporter room,Scott,,"Well, it looks like that ship was expecting us. We read heat coming on, complete oxygen atmosphere."
24,1,Space Seed,transporter room,Kirk,,"Very interesting. You ready, Bones?"
24,1,Space Seed,transporter room,Mccoy,,"No. I signed aboard this ship to practice medicine, not to have my atoms scattered back and forth across space by this gadget."
24,1,Space Seed,transporter room,Kirk,,"You're an old-fashioned boy, McCoy. Where's that historian? (McGivers enters) Come on, Lieutenant"
24,1,Space Seed,transporter room,Marla,,"McGivers, sir."
24,1,Space Seed,transporter room,Kirk,,Energise.
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,,"Men and women are lying in clear-sided compartments, seemingly asleep.) KIRK: Scotty",
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Scott,,"Definitely Earth-type mechanism, sir. Twentieth century vessel. Old type atomic power. Bulky, solid. I think they used to call them transistor units. I'd love to tear this baby apart."
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Marla,,"Captain, it's a sleeper ship."
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Kirk,,Suspended animation.
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Marla,,I've seen old photographs of this. Necessary because of the time involved in space travel until about the year 2018. It took years just to travel from one planet to another.
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Kirk,,Is it possible they're still alive after centuries of travel?
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Mccoy,,It's theoretically possible. I've never heard of it being tested for this long a period.
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Marla,,What a handsome group of people.
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Mccoy,,"Jim, I have a new reading. The lights must have triggered some mechanism."
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Marla,,"Captain, look here."
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,,They go to the compartment holding a dark-haired man.,
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Kirk,,Scotty?
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Scott,,Beats me what's happening.
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Mccoy,,"We've triggered something, all right. His heart beat's increasing. Now passing eight beats per minute. There are some signs of respiration beginning."
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Scott,,This one was probably programmed to be triggered first.
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Kirk,,Could he be the leader? The leader. Lieutenant?

24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Scott,,It'd take an hour to figure it out.
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Kirk,,What happens if we get him out of there?

A boarding party of engineering and medical specialists are now completing their examination of the mysterious vessel.

24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,"Scotty, any records, log books of any kind?"
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Scott,,"Negative, Captain. It appears they were in suspended animation when the ship took off."
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Kirk,,How many alive?
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Scott,,"Twelve units have malfunctioned, leaving seventy two still operating. Thirty of those are women."
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Kirk,,"Kirk out. Seventy two alive. A group of people dating back to the 1990s. A discovery of some importance, Mister Spock. There are a great many unanswered questions about those years."
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Spock,,"A strange, violent period in your history. I find no record what so ever of an SS Botany Bay. Captain, the DY-100 class vessel was designed for interplanetary travel only. With simple nuclear-powered engines, star travel was considered impractical at that time. It was ten thousand to one against their making it to another star system. And why no record of the trip?"
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Kirk,,"Botany Bay. That was the name of a penal colony on shores of Australia, wasn't it? If they took that name for their vessel"
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Spock,,"If you're suggesting this was a penal deportation vessel, you've arrived at a totally illogical conclusion."
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Kirk,,Oh?
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Spock,,Your Earth was on the verge of a dark ages. Whole populations were being bombed out of existence. A group of criminals could have been dealt with far more efficiently than wasting one of their most advanced spaceships.
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Kirk,,Yes. So much for my theory. I'm still waiting to hear yours.
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Spock,,"Even a theory requires some facts, Captain. So far I have none."
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Kirk,,"And that irritates you, Mister Spock."
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Spock,,Irritation?
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Kirk,,Yeah.
24,1,Space Seed,ss botany bay,Spock,,I am not capable of that emotion.

24,1,Space Seed,sickbay - medical ward,Mccoy,,"No, I'm good, but not that good. There's something inside this man that refuses to accept death. Look at that. Even as he is now, his heart valve action has twice the power of yours and mine. Lung efficiency is fifty percent better."

24,1,Space Seed,sickbay - medical ward,Marla,,"Not personally, Captain. Professionally. My profession is historian, and when I find a specimen from the past alive, I'm in the sheer delight of examining his mind."
24,1,Space Seed,sickbay - medical ward,Kirk,,"And men were more adventuresome then. Bolder, more colourful."
24,1,Space Seed,sickbay - medical ward,Marla,,"Yes, sir, I think they were."
24,1,Space Seed,sickbay - medical ward,Kirk,,"Good. If I can have honesty, it's easier to overlook mistakes. That's all."

24,1,Space Seed,sickbay - medical ward,Mccoy,,"You're in (a squeeze makes him lower his voice) You're in bed, holding a knife at your doctor's throat."
24,1,Space Seed,sickbay - medical ward,Khan,,Answer my question.

24,1,Space Seed,sickbay - medical ward,Kirk,,And your name?
24,1,Space Seed,sickbay - medical ward,Khan,,I have a few questions first. What is your heading?
24,1,Space Seed,sickbay - medical ward,Kirk,,"Our heading is Starbase Twelve, a planet in the Gamma 400 star system. Our command base in this sector. Is that of any use to you?"

24,1,Space Seed,sickbay - medical ward,Khan,,"I find myself growing fatigued, Doctor. May we continue this questioning at some other time?"
24,1,Space Seed,sickbay - medical ward,Kirk,,"The facts I need, Mister Khan, will take very little time. For example, the nature of your expedition."
24,1,Space Seed,sickbay - medical ward,Mccoy,,Jim. A little later might be better.
24,1,Space Seed,sickbay - medical ward,Khan,,"Captain, I wonder if I could have something to read during my convalescence. I was once an engineer of sorts. I would be most interested in studying the technical manuals on your vessel."
24,1,Space Seed,sickbay - medical ward,Kirk,,"Yes, I understand. You have two hundred years of catching up to do."
24,1,Space Seed,sickbay - medical ward,Khan,,Precisely.
24,1,Space Seed,sickbay - medical ward,Kirk,,They're available to any patient on the viewing screen. Doctor McCoy will show you how to tie into the library tapes.

24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Spock,,I note he's making considerable use of our technical library.
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,"Common courtesy, Mister Spock. He'll spend the rest of his days in our time. It's only decent to help him catch up. Would you estimate him to be a product of selective breeding?"
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Spock,,"There is that possibility, Captain. His age would be correct. In 1993, a group of these young supermen did seize power simultaneously in over forty nations."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,"Well, they were hardly supermen. They were aggressive, arrogant. They began to battle among themselves."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Spock,,Because the scientists overlooked one fact. Superior ability breeds superior ambition.
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,"Interesting, if true. They created a group of Alexanders, Napoleons."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Spock,,"I have collected some names and made some counts. By my estimate, there were some eighty or ninety of these young supermen unaccounted for when they were finally defeated."
24,1,Space Seed,bridge,Kirk,,That fact isn't in the history texts.

24,1,Space Seed,briefing room,Marla,,No!
24,1,Space Seed,briefing room,Khan,,"I should have realised that suffocating together on the Bridge would create heroic camaraderie among you. But it is quite a different thing to watch it happening to someone else. Engage the viewing screen. I'm sure you recognise your medical decompression chamber here, Doctor. And the meaning of that indicator. (It is dropping to 10Hg) Your Captain will die. If you join me, Mister Spock, I will save his life. My vessel was useless. I need you and yours to select a colony planet. One with a population willing to be led by us."
24,1,Space Seed,briefing room,Mccoy,,"To be conquered by you. A starship would make that most simple, wouldn't it?"
24,1,Space Seed,briefing room,Khan,,Each of you in turn will go in there. Die while the others watch.

24,1,Space Seed,briefing room,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, our heading takes us near the Ceti Alpha star system."
24,1,Space Seed,briefing room,Spock,,"Quite correct, Captain. Planet number five there is habitable, although a bit savage, somewhat inhospitable."
24,1,Space Seed,briefing room,Kirk,,"But no more than Australia's Botany Bay colony was at the beginning. Those men went on to tame a continent, Mister Khan. Can you tame a world?"

24,1,Space Seed,briefing room,Spock,,"It would be interesting, Captain, to return to that world in a hundred years and to learn what crop has sprung from the seed you planted today."

25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, Lieutenant."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Uhura,,I've been transmitting a contact signal every five minutes. All I get is dead air. Shall I continue?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,Maintain transmission pattern until we've established orbit.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, aye, sir."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, there were one hundred and fifty men, women, and children in that colony. What are the chances of survivors?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Spock,,"Absolutely none, Captain. Berthold rays are such a recent discovery. We do not yet have full knowledge of their nature. It is known, however, that living animal tissue disintegrates under exposure. Sandoval's group could not have survived after three years."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,Are you saying that those people built a future in a place knowing they might not survive?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Spock,,I am saying they knew there was a risk.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,And what about us? Can we afford to send people to the planet's surface?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Spock,,The breakdown of tissue does not develop immediately. We can risk a limited exposure.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Painter,,"We've established orbit, sir, and I've pinpointed a settlement."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,"Thank you, Mister Painter. Mister Spock, equip a landing party of five to accompany me to the planet's surface. Include Doctor McCoy and a biologist. I'll want them in ten minutes."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farm yard,,"The group beam down into a farm, complete with wooden fence and a tarmacadamed paths. There are clap-board buildings and even a stable block.",
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farm yard,Kirk,,Another dream that failed. There's nothing sadder. It took these people a year to make the trip from Earth. They came all that way and died.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farm yard,Elias,,"Hardly that, sir. Welcome to Omicron Ceti Three. I'm Elias Sandoval."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farm yard,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 3417.3. We thought our mission to Omicron Ceti Three would be an unhappy one. We had expected to find no survivors of the agricultural colony there. Apparently, our information was incorrect."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farm yard,Elias,,"We haven't seen anyone outside our group for four years since we left Earth. We've been expecting someone for some time. Our subspace radio didn't work properly, and I'm afraid we didn't have anyone who could master its intricacies."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farm yard,Kirk,,"Actually, Mister Sandoval, we didn't come here because of your silent radio."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farm yard,Elias,,"It makes little difference, Captain. You're here. We're happy to see you. Come, let me show you our settlement."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farm yard,Mccoy,,"On pure speculation, just an educated guess, I'd say that man is alive."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farm yard,Spock,,"Captain, this planet is being bombarded by Berthold rays, as our reports indicated. At this intensity, we'll be safe for a week if necessary. But"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farm yard,Kirk,,But these people shouldn't be alive.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farm yard,Sulu,,Is it possible that they're not?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farm yard,Mccoy,,"You shook hands with him, Jim. His flesh was warm. He's alive. There's no doubt about that."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farm yard,Spock,,"There's also no question of the fact that Berthold rays are incontrovertibly deadly. There's no miracle connected with it, Doctor, you know that. No cures, no serums, no antidotes. If a man is exposed long enough, he dies."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farm yard,Kirk,,"Gentlemen, we're debating in a vacuum. Let's go get some answers."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,,Elias leads the way into a comfortable room with wooden furniture and gingham curtains.,
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Elias,,"There are two other settlements, but we have forty five colonists here."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Kirk,,What was the reason for the dispersal?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Elias,,"We felt three groups would have better potential. If disease were to strike one group, the others would be less likely to be affected. You see, Omicron is an ideal agricultural planet. We determined not to suffer the fate of expeditions that went before us."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Leila,,Elias.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Elias,,"Leila, come meet our guests. This is Leila Kalomi, our botanist. This is Captain Kirk, Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Leila,,Mister Spock and I have met before. It's been a long time.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Kirk,,"Mister Sandoval, we do have a mission here. Examinations, tests."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Elias,,"By all means, make them. I think you'll find our settlement an interesting one. Our philosophy is a simple one, that men should return to a less complicated life. We have few mechanical things here. No vehicles, no weapons. We have harmony here. Complete peace."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Kirk,,We'll try not to interfere with your work.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Elias,,"Make yourselves at home, gentlemen."

25,1,This Side of Paradise,"outside, by the barn",Sulu,,"Whatever doesn't look right, whatever that is. When it comes to farms, I wouldn't know what looked right or wrong if it were two feet from me."

25,1,This Side of Paradise,"outside, by the barn",Sulu,,What is it?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,"outside, by the barn",Kelowitz,,"No cows. This barn isn't even built for them, Just for storage."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,"outside, by the barn",Sulu,,"Come to think of it, we haven't seen any animals. No horses, no pigs, not even a dog. Nothing."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Elias,,You've known the Vulcanian?

25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Elias,,Did you love him?

25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Elias,,How did he feel?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Leila,,Mister Spock's feelings were never expressed to me. It is said he has none to give.

25,1,This Side of Paradise,drawing room,Kirk,,Anything?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,drawing room,Mccoy,,"I've examined nine men so far, varying in ages from twenty three to fifty nine. They're all in perfect condition. Text book responses. Heart, lungs, excellent. Co-ordination, excellent. Reflexes, excellent. If there are many more of them, I could throw away my shingle."

25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Kirk,,Sulu had the same observation. Any explanations?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Spock,,"Not at the moment, sir. I am conducting various tests with the tricorder, but results are inconclusive."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,drawing room,Kirk,,Very well. Continue investigations. Kirk out.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,drawing room,Mccoy,,No animals. That's peculiar.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,drawing room,Kirk,,"Yes, especially in view of the fact that the records for this expedition indicate that they did have some for breeding and food purposes. Apparently, none of them survived."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,drawing room,Mccoy,,I'd like to see the medical records on the expedition.

25,1,This Side of Paradise,drawing room,Mccoy,,"I'm afraid I'll have to bow out. I have to continue with these medical examinations. However, if I find everyone else's health to be as perfect as yours, I"

25,1,This Side of Paradise,drawing room,Elias,,You'll find no weaklings here. Captain.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Elias,,"This is the reason, Captain. This soil will grow anything we plant in it. It's a perfect world. We have a moderate climate, moderate rains all year round. It gives us all we need. It is perfect."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Desalle,,"Pardon me, Captain. Biology report ready, sir."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Elias,,"I have work to attend to myself, Captain."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,,He leaves them.,
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Kirk,,"Go ahead, Lieutenant."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Desalle,,"I heard Sandoval saying they could grow anything here. That's true, sir. They've got a variety of crops in. Grains, potatoes, beans."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Kirk,,Make your point.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Desalle,,"Well, sir, for an agricultural colony, they have actually very little acreage planted. There's enough to sustain the colony, but very little more."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Kirk,,It's like a jigsaw puzzle all one colour. No key to where the pieces fit in. Why?

25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Kirk,,Trouble?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Mccoy,,"No, but I'd like you to see this for yourself."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Kirk,,On my way.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Mccoy,,"Sandoval's medical record, four years ago when the expedition left Earth. He registered scar tissue on his lungs from lobar pneumonia suffered when he was a child. No major operations, but there was an appendectomy. Received all required inoculations, et cetera."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Kirk,,What's so strange about that?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Mccoy,,"Nothing, but I examined that man no more than two hours ago. You know what his readings were? Perfect, perfect, and perfect. Just like everyone else I've examined here."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Kirk,,Instrument malfunction?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Mccoy,,"No. I thought of that and tested it on myself. It accurately recorded my lack of tonsils and those two broken ribs I had once. It did not record the scar tissue on Sandoval's lungs, but it did record a healthy appendix where one was supposedly removed."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,,Spock is scanning amongst the rows of dry-looking somethings.,
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Spock,,"Nothing. Not even insects. Yet your plants grow, and you've survived exposure to Berthold rays."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Leila,,That can be explained.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Spock,,Please do.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Leila,,Later.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Spock,,I have never understood the female capacity to avoid a direct answer to any question.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Leila,,And I never understood you. Until now. There was always a place in here where no one could come. There was only the face you allow people to see. Only one side you'd allow them to know.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Spock,,I would like to know how your people have managed to survive here.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Leila,,I missed you.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Spock,,"Logically, you should all be dead."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Leila,,"If I tell you how we survived, will you try to understand how we feel about our life here? About each other?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Spock,,Emotions are alien to me. I'm a scientist.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Leila,,"Someone else might believe that. Your shipmates, your Captain, but not me. Come."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,drawing room,Kirk,,"Mister Sandoval, within the hour I've received orders from Starfleet Command to evacuate all personnel from this colony. Naturally, you'll inform your people to begin preparations. We will have accommodations for you aboard the Enterprise."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,drawing room,Elias,,No.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,drawing room,Kirk,,It's not an arbitrary decision on my part. I have my orders.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,drawing room,Elias,,"Captain, it's entirely unnecessary. We're in no danger here."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,drawing room,Mccoy,,We've explained the Berthold rays to you and their effect. Can't you understand?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,drawing room,Elias,,"Doctor, how can I make you understand? Your own instruments have shown that we're all in perfect health. We've had no deaths here."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,drawing room,Kirk,,What about your animals?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,drawing room,Elias,,We're vegetarians.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,drawing room,Kirk,,"That doesn't answer my question, sir. Why did all your animals die?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,drawing room,Elias,,"Captain, you stress very unimportant matters. We will not leave."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,,"The grass is brown and dry, but the pink flowers are growing.",
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Leila,,It's not much further.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Spock,,You've not yet explained the nature of this thing.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Leila,,"Its basic properties and elements are not important. What is important is it gives life, peace, love."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Spock,,"What you're describing was once known in the vernacular as a happiness pill. And you, as a scientist, should know that that's not possible."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Leila,,Come. I was one of the first to find them. The spores.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Spock,,Spores?

25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Kirk,,We have orders to evacuate all colonists to Starbase Twenty Seven.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Narrator,,I want landing parties to co-ordinate the colonists and prepare them for transport up to the ship. We'll need extra accommodations aboard. Where's Mister Spock and Mister DeSalle?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Sulu,,We haven't seen them since we began our check.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Mccoy,,DeSalle said he was going to examine some native plants he found. Did Spock call in at all?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Kirk,,"No, he didn't. (gets out communicator) Spock? See to the landing parties, would you, Mister Sulu."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Sulu,,"Yes, sir."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Kirk,,Spock?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,,"Spock's communicator is beeping to itself while he is lying in Leila's lap, looking at the clouds. He has changed out of his uniform into an overall.",
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Spock,,That one looks like a dragon. You see the tail and the dorsal spines?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Leila,,I've never seen a dragon.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Spock,,"I have. On Berengaria Seven. But I've never stopped to look at clouds before. Or rainbows. You know, I can tell you exactly why one appears in the sky, but considering its beauty has always been out of the question."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Leila,,Not here.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,,She picks up the communicator and it opens.,
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Kirk,,Spock!
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Spock,,"Yes, what did you want?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Kirk,,"Spock, is that you?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Spock,,"Yes, Captain. What did you want?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Kirk,,Where are you?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Spock,,I don't believe I want to tell you.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Kirk,,"Spock, I don't know what you think you're doing, but this is an order. Report back to me at the settlement in ten minutes. We're evacuating all colonists to Starbase Twenty Seven."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Spock,,"No, I don't think so."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Kirk,,"You don't think so, what?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Spock,,"I don't think so, sir."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Kirk,,"Spock, report to me immediately."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,,But the communicator drops to the ground during another kiss,
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Kirk,,Spock? Acknowledge.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Kirk,,"Spock. The frequency is open, but he doesn't answer."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Mccoy,,"That didn't sound at all like Spock, Jim."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Kirk,,No. I thought you said you might like him if he mellowed a little.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Mccoy,,I didn't say that.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Kirk,,You said that.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Mccoy,,Not exactly. He might be in trouble.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Kirk,,"Yes, take over the landing party detail and start getting those colonists aboard."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Mccoy,,How will you find Spock?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmyard,Kirk,,The frequency is open. It'll act as a homing device. Contact DeSalle. Have him meet you here. Make sure the landing party work in teams of two. I don't want anybody left alone down here.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,,"They find the communicator, and hear laughter. Spock is hanging upside down from a branch of a nearby tree.",

25,1,This Side of Paradise,beam-down point,,Items are being collected to be taken up to the ship. DeSalle has brought some of the pink plants.,
25,1,This Side of Paradise,beam-down point,Mccoy,,"What are you doing with those things, DeSalle?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,beam-down point,Desalle,,"I want you to take a close look at these, Doc. They're very interesting."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Kirk,,Mister Spock. Are you out of your mind? You were told to report to me at once.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Spock,,"I didn't want to, Jim."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Kirk,,"You? Yes, I can see that. Miss Kalomi, you'll have to come back to the settlement and prepare to transport up to the ship."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Spock,,"There'll be no evacuation, Jim, but perhaps we should go back and get you straightened out."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Kirk,,"Mister Sulu, Mister Spock is under arrest, and he's in your custody until we get back to the Enterprise."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Spock,,Very well. Come with me.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,,"He takes Leila's hand and leads the group to a clump of the plants, where they all get sprayed with spores.",
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Kirk,,What's?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Spock,,"Mister Sulu understands, don't you, Mister Sulu?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Sulu,,"Yes, I see now. Of course we can't remove the colony. It'd be wrong."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Kirk,,"I don't know what these plants are or how they work, but you're all going back to the settlement with me, and those colonists are going aboard the ship."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,,Kirk leaves them.,

25,1,This Side of Paradise,another pasture,Kirk,,How many of those did you beam up?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,another pasture,Mccoy,,"Oh, must be nigh onto a hundred by now."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,another pasture,Chief,,"Hey, Doc, I'm ready to energise. Everything okay with those plants?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,another pasture,Kirk,,This is the Captain. Beam me up.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,another pasture,Chief,,"Well, sure, if you want."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,another pasture,Kirk,,I most certainly do. Energise.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant, put me through to Admiral Komack at Starfleet."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Uhura,,"Oh, I'm sorry, Captain. I can't do that."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,"What do you mean, you can't do that. Follow standard procedure. That's an order."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Uhura,,"Oh, I know it is, Captain, but you see, all communications are out."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,Out?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Uhura,,"I short-circuited them, except ship to surface. We'll need that for a while. It's really for the best, Captain."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,,She leaves the Bridge. Kirk finds a plant and throws it angrily across the helm console before storming out himself.,
25,1,This Side of Paradise,corridor,,There's a long queue of crewmembers lounging against the wall outside the transporter room.,
25,1,This Side of Paradise,corridor,Kirk,,Get back to your stations. Get back to your stations.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,corridor,Leslie,,"I'm sorry, sir. We're all transporting down to join the colony."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,corridor,Kirk,,I said get back to your station.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,corridor,Leslie,,"No, sir."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,corridor,Kirk,,"This is mutiny, mister."

Under their influence, my crew is deserting to join the Omicron colony, and I can't stop them.

25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Mccoy,,"I'm not interested in any physical-psychological aspects, Jim boy. We all perfectly healthy down here."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,I've heard that word a lot lately. Perfect. Everything's perfect.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Mccoy,,Yeah. That's right. That's just what it is.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,I'll bet you've even grown your tonsils back.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Mccoy,,"Sho'nuf. Hey, Jim boy, y'all ever have a real cold Georgia-style mint julep, huh?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,"Look, Bones, I need your help. Can you run tests, blood samples, anything at all to give us a lead on what these things are, how to counteract them?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Mccoy,,"Who wants to counteract paradise, Jim boy?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Mccoy,,McCoy out.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,Bones. Bones.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,,Spock is pouring tea.,
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Spock,,Almost the entire ship's complement has beamed down.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Elias,,I'm very pleased. The entire landing operation is proceeding quite well.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,,Kirk enters,
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Kirk,,Where's McCoy?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Spock,,"He went off to create something called a mint julep. That's a drink, Jim."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Elias,,"Captain, why don't you join us?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Kirk,,In your own private paradise.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Elias,,The spores have made it that.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Kirk,,Where did they originate?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Spock,,"It's impossible to say. They drifted through space until they finally landed here. You see, they actually thrive on Berthold rays. The plants act as a repository for thousands of microscopic spores until they find a human body to inhabit."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Elias,,"In return, they give you complete health and peace of mind."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Kirk,,That's paradise?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Elias,,"We have no need or want, Captain."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Spock,,"It's a true Eden, Jim. There's belonging and love."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Kirk,,"No wants. No needs. We weren't meant for that. None of us. Man stagnates if he has no ambition, no desire to be more than he is."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Elias,,We have what we need.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Kirk,,Except a challenge.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Spock,,"You don't understand, Jim, but you'll come around sooner or later. Join us. Please."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,farmhouse,Kirk,,I'm going back to the ship.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,,"All the panels are lit, the lights are on, but nobody is home except one.",
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,Engineering? Scotty? Biochemistry lab? Security? Is there anyone on board? This is the Captain.

25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,"Captain's log, stardate 3417.7. Except for myself, all crew personnel have transported to the surface of the planet. Mutinied. Lieutenant Uhura has effectively sabotaged the communications station. I can only contact the surface of the planet. The ship can be maintained in orbit for several months, but even with automatic controls, I cannot pilot her alone. In effect, I am marooned here. I'm beginning to realise just how big this ship really is, how quiet. I don't know how to get my crew back, how to counteract the effect of the spores. I don't know what I can offer against paradise."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,,"The plant that he had thrown earlier, now sprays him with spores.",

25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,I've joined you. I understand now.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Spock,,"Wonderful, Jim. When will you beam down?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,There are some things in my quarters I want to pack.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Spock,,Good. Leila and I will meet you at the beam down point.

25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,,Kirk puts his suitcase on the transporter pad and goes over to the controls.,
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Kirk,,"No. No! I can't leave! (he's very relieved) Emotions. Violent emotions. Needs. Anger. Captain's log, supplemental. I think I've discovered the answer, but to carry out my plan entails considerable risk. Mister Spock is much stronger than the ordinary human being. Aroused, his great physical strength could kill. But it's a risk I'll have to take."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Kirk,,Enterprise to Mister Spock.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Spock,,Spock here.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Kirk,,It's Jim.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Spock,,"What's keeping you, Jim? We've been waiting."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Kirk,,"I've been packing some things, and I realise there's some equipment here that we should have down at the settlement."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Kirk,,You know we can't come back on board once the last of us has left.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Spock,,Do you want me to beam up a party?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Kirk,,"No, I think you and I can handle it. Why don't you beam up now?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Spock,,Just a moment. It won't take long. Do you mind?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Leila,,I'll wait.

25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Kirk,,"All right, you mutinous, disloyal, computerised, half-breed, we'll see about you deserting my ship."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Spock,,"The term half-breed is somewhat applicable, but computerised is inaccurate. A machine can be computerised, not a man."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Kirk,,"What makes you think you're a man? You're an overgrown jackrabbit, an elf with a hyperactive thyroid."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Spock,,"Jim, I don't understand."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Kirk,,Of course you don't understand. You don't have the brains to understand. All you have is printed circuits.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Spock,,"Captain, if you'll excuse me."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Kirk,,"What can you expect from a simpering, devil-eared freak whose father was a computer and his mother an encyclopedia?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Spock,,My mother was a teacher. My father an ambassador.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Kirk,,"Your father was a computer, like his son. An ambassador from a planet of traitors. A Vulcan never lived who had an ounce of integrity."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Spock,,"Captain, please don't"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Kirk,,"You're a traitor from a race of traitors. Disloyal to the core, rotten like the rest of your subhuman race, and you've got the gall to make love to that girl."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Spock,,That's enough.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Kirk,,"Does she know what she's getting, Spock? A carcass full of memory banks who should be squatting in a mushroom, instead of passing himself off as a man? You belong in a circus, Spock, not a starship. Right next to the dog-faced boy."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,,"Spock bends the metal bar with one blow, and throws Kirk around the transporter room with ease. Fortunately, Kirk is able to dodge the blows that damage the walls and equipment until finally...",
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Kirk,,"Had enough? I didn't realise what it took to get under that thick hide of yours. Anyhow, I don't know what you're so mad about. It isn't every first officer who gets to belt his Captain several times."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Spock,,You did that to me deliberately.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Kirk,,"Believe me, Mister Spock, it was painful in more ways than one."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Spock,,The spores. They're gone. I don't belong anymore.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Kirk,,"You said they were benevolent and peaceful. Violent emotions overwhelm them, destroy them. I had to make you angry enough to shake off their influence. That's the answer, Mister Spock."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Spock,,"That may be correct, Captain, but trying to initiate a brawl with over five hundred crewmen and colonists is hardly logical."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Kirk,,I had something else in mind. Can you put together a subsonic transmitter. Something we can hook into the communications station and broadcast over the communicator?
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Spock,,It can be done.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Kirk,,Good. Let's get to work.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Spock,,Captain. Striking a fellow officer is a court martial offence.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Kirk,,"Well, if we're both in the Brig, who's going to build the subsonic transmitter?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Spock,,"That is quite logical, Captain."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Mccoy,,"Well now, it's a little early to be counting stars, Miss Leila."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Leila,,I'm waiting for Mister Spock and the Captain to transport down. They had some equipment to be moved. But it's been so long. I wish he'd come back.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Mccoy,,"Well, now, I think I can fix that for you. Enterprise?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,,Spock is back in uniform and under the console when it beeps.,
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Spock,,Enterprise. Spock here.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Leila,,This is Leila. I borrowed the doctor's communicator. I was worried something might have happened to you.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Leila,,"You are all right, aren't you?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Spock,,Yes. Yes. I'm quite well.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Leila,,Can I come aboard? I've never seen a starship before
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Leila,,and I want to talk to you.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Spock,,"Are you still at the beam down point, and is the doctor there?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,field,Leila,,Yes to both questions.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Spock,,Give your communicator back to Doctor McCoy. You won't need it to beam up. It'll take a few moments. Just wait there. Out.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, Miss Kalomi is strictly your concern, but should you talk to her while she's still under the influence of the spores?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Spock,,"I'll be back shortly, Captain."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,,"Once she's materialised she rushes to put her arms around him, but he doesn't respond.",
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Leila,,"You're no longer with us, are you? I felt something was wrong."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Spock,,It was necessary.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Leila,,"Come back to the planet with me. You can belong again. Come back with me, please."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Spock,,I can't.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Leila,,"I love you. I said that six years ago, and I can't seem to stop repeating myself. On Earth, you couldn't give anything of yourself. You couldn't even put your arms around me. We couldn't have anything together there. We couldn't have anything together anyplace else. We're happy here. (crying) I can't lose you now, Mister Spock. I can't."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Spock,,"I have a responsibility to this ship, to that man on the Bridge. I am what I am, Leila, and if there are self-made purgatories, then we all have to live in them. Mine can be no worse than someone else's."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Leila,,"I have lost you, haven't I? And not only you, I've lost all of it. The spores. I've lost them, too."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Kirk,,The Captain discovered that strong emotions and needs destroy the spore influence.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Leila,,"And this is for my good? Do you mind if I say I still love you? You never told me if you had another name, Mister Spock."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,transporter room,Spock,wiping away her tears,You couldn't pronounce it.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Spock,,"They'll not hear this, of course. It'll be more a sensation of feeling it."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,As though somebody had put itching powder on their skin.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Spock,,Precisely. It should begin to work on their nerves in a few minutes.

25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Elias,,"Not any more, of course. We don't need you. Not as a doctor."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Mccoy,,"Oh, no? Would you like to see how fast I can put you in a hospital?"
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Elias,,I am the leader of this colony. I'll assign you whatever work I think suitable.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Mccoy,,"Just a minute. You'd better make me a mechanic. Then I can treat little tin gods like you. (He punches Elias) Sorry, Sandoval. I don't know what made me do that."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Elias,,"We've done nothing here. No accomplishments, no progress. Three years wasted. We wanted to make this planet a garden."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Mccoy,,"You can't stay here. You can't survive without the spores. After you've cleared at the Starbase, you could be relocated. It depends upon what you want."

25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Mccoy,,This is McCoy. Sandoval would like to talk to the Captain.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Spock,,"Just a moment. They're all beginning to call in, Captain. Rather contritely, I should say. Sandoval wishes to speak to you."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,Put him on the speaker. Kirk here.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,pasture,Elias,,"Oh, Captain, as I understood it, you were to transport us to Starbase Twenty Seven. We'll give you every co-operation."

25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,,"Later, when everyone is back on duty.",
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, Jim, I've just examined the last of the colonists, and they're all in absolutely perfect, perfect health. A fringe benefit left over by the spores."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Kirk,,Good.
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, that's the second time man's been thrown out of paradise."

Struggle, claw our way up, scratch for every inch of the way. Maybe we can't stroll to the music of the lute. We must march to the sound of drums."
25,1,This Side of Paradise,bridge,Spock,,"Poetry, Captain. Non-regulation."

26,1,The Devil In The Dark,mine tunnel,Sam,,"Didn't see a thing, Chief."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,mine tunnel,Schmitter,,"Nobody ever does. Whatever the thing is, it's already killed fifty people. I never realised before how dark it is down here."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,mine tunnel,Vanderberg,,"Stay on your toes, Schmitter. Keep your phaser in your hand at all times."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,mine tunnel,Schmitter,,What good will that do? You saw what happened to Ed Appel when he shot at it. How about those other people before the monster got them?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,mine tunnel,Vanderberg,,"I'm sorry, Schmitter. I know how you feel, but we've got to have guards."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,mine tunnel,Schmitter,,"Okay, Chief. I'll do what I can."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,mine tunnel,Vanderberg,,"Keep alert. If you hear anything or see anything, call in. Somebody can arrive in three minutes."

26,1,The Devil In The Dark,mine tunnel,Vanderberg,,It's coming.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,mine tunnel,Schmitter,,You think it could get here in the next four hours?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,mine tunnel,Vanderberg,,You'll be all right.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,mine tunnel,,"The group leaves, and nervous Schmitter paces. Then we hear a scraping sound. He turns, looks and screams. Vanderberg and the others run back.",
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,mine tunnel,Vanderberg,,Come on.

A distress call from the pergium production station on Janus Six has brought the Enterprise to that long-established colony. Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy, and I have beamed down to meet with Chief Engineer Vanderberg, administrative head of Janus Six."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,"All right, let's assume there is a monster. What has it done? When did it start?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,"About three months ago, we opened up a new level. Sensors gave us an unusually rich pergium reading. Not only pergium, whatever you want. Uranium, sirium, platinum. The whole planet's like that. It's a treasure house."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,"Yes, we're aware of that. If mining conditions weren't so difficult, Janus Six could supply the mineral needs of a thousand planets. But what happened?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,"First, the automatic machinery, piece by piece, started to almost disintegrate. Metal began dissolving away. There was no reason for it, and our chemists were unable to analyse the corrosive agent."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,,I'm sure there is an answer. It simply has not yet been discovered.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,"Yes, it has. I don't know what this butchering monster is, but I know what it's doing. Our maintenance engineers sent down to the drifts to repair the corroded machinery. We found them seared to a crisp."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,Volcanic activity?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,,"There is no current volcanic activity on this planet, Captain."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,"He's right. None. At first the deaths were down deep, but they've been moving up toward our levels. The last man died two days ago three levels below this."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,Same way? Burned?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Mccoy,,I'd like to examine the body.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,We kept it for you. There isn't much left. Roberts will show you. (McCoy and the guard leave) It isn't pretty.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,Do you post sentries? Guards?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,Of course. Five of them have died.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,Who else has seen this?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Appel,entering,I have.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,"This is Ed Appel, chief processing engineer."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,Describe it.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Appel,,"I can't. I only got a glimpse of it, but it's big and shaggy."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,Ed shot it.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,,Oh. You mean shot at it.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Appel,,No. I mean shot it. With this. (a hand phaser)
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,,Fascinating.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Appel,,"A good, clean shot. Didn't even slow it down. Well, I've made my report to you. Production has stopped, nobody will go into the lower levels, and I don't blame them. If the Federation wants pergium, then you're going to have to do something about it."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,"That's why we're here, Mister Vanderberg."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Appel,,"You're all pretty tough, aren't you? Starship, phaser banks. You can't get your starship down in the tunnels."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,"I don't think we'll need to, Mister Appel. Mister Vanderberg, we'll need a complete subsurface chart of all the drifts, galleries and tunnels."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Narrator,,"Mister Vanderberg, I'll need a complete subsurface chart of all the drifts, galleries, tunnels."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,You'll get it.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,examining a large globe from Vanderberg's desk,"Mister Vanderberg, what is this?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,It's a silicon nodule. There are a millions of them are down there. No commercial value.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,,"But a geological oddity, to say the least. Pure silicon?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,"A few trace elements. Look, we didn't call you here so you could collect rocks."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,"Thank you, Mister Vanderberg. We'll need your complete co-operation."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,"You'll have it. Just find that creature, whatever it is. I've got a quota to meet. Come on, Appel."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,,"They leave, and McCoy comes back.",
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,The vast number of tunnels won't make our hunting any easier. Doc?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Mccoy,,"Schmitter didn't burn to death, not in the usual sense, anyway."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,Explain.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Mccoy,,"Well, there are only fragments of bone and teeth left, but the plant's physician agrees with me. A chemical corrosion. Almost as if he'd been thrown into a vat of extremely corrosive acid."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,Strong enough to eat machinery?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Mccoy,,Strong enough to eat anything else that you can think of.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,Mister Spock.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,at the mine map,"I've charted the positions of the deaths and acts of sabotage. Here, here, and here. If the times of these incidents are to be accepted as accurate, the creature would have to have moved at an incredible rate of speed."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,"Mister Vanderberg, how recent are these charts?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,reentering,They were made last year.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,Before the appearance of whatever it is?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,That's right.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,I see. Mister Spock give us a report on life beneath the surface.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Narrator,,"Within range of our sensors, there is no life, other than the accountable human residents of this colony beneath the surface. At least, no life as we know it."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,We can't cover tunnel by tunnel on foot. We must get production going again. We must have that pergium.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,,If we could force another appearance of this creature
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,"When that creature appears, men die."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,,"And as if to prove his point, the guard outside the power plant is killed. There's just a vaguely man-shaped stain on the ground and wisps of smoke lead us to a neat circular hole in the door he was guarding.",
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,"Too many tunnels. We couldn't possibly. Mister Spock, our sensors can pick up normal life functions at a considerable distance, but what about abnormal life functions?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,,Just then the lights flicker and an alarm sounds.,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,Something's happening in the reactor room!
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnel outside the reactor room,Vanderberg,,Back to your stations. Look at that.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnel outside the reactor room,,He goes through the hole cut in the door.,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnel outside the reactor room,Spock,,"I wouldn't touch it, Captain. An extremely active corrosive. Traces may linger."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnel outside the reactor room,Vanderberg,,"Kirk, quickly!"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,,They step through carefully.,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Vanderberg,,The main circulating pump for the entire reactor is gone.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Spock,,"The same indication as shown at the door, Captain. A very strong corrosive."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Kirk,,Is there a replacement for that?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Vanderberg,,"No, none. It's outdated, but we never had any trouble with it."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Kirk,,"Spock, on board?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Spock,,"Nothing for a device this antiquated, Captain."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Vanderberg,,"Without the pump mechanism, the reactor will go supercritical. It could poison half the planet. We can't shut it down. It provides heat and air and life support for the whole colony."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, we seem to have been given a choice. Death by asphyxiation or death by radiation poisoning."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Scott,,"A PXK pergium reactor? No, sir. We don't have any spare circulating pump for a thing like that. I haven't seen a PXK in twenty years."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Kirk,,Can you rig one up? It's vital.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Scott,,"Well sir, I can put together some odds and ends, but it won't hold for long."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Kirk,,How long?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Scott,,"Forty eight hours maybe, with a bit of luck."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Kirk,,Forty eight hours is better than nothing. Gather what you need and beam down here with it.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Narrator,,{Bridge]
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Kirk,,Top priority.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Scott,,"Aye, Captain."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Scott,,I'll be right down. Scott out.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Vanderberg,,What happens when it breaks down?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Kirk,,Hopefully we'll have found the missing part by then.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Vanderberg,,Hopefully. Small chance.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Kirk,,"We'll have to, Chief. The alternative is to evacuate all you people up to the Enterprise. A dozen planets depend on you for pergium for their reactor. They're already screaming. Reactors closing down, life support systems"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Vanderberg,,"I'm concerned with my people right here, Kirk. They're being murdered. You find that monster and kill it."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,,The missing pump wasn't taken by accident. It was the one piece of equipment absolutely essential for the operation of the reactor.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,Do you think the creature is trying to push the colonists off the planet?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,,It would seem so.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,"But why now, Mister Spock? These production facilities have been in operation for over fifty years."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,,I don't know. But there is a possibility.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,,He goes over to the silicon nodule on the desk.,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,What's that?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,,"Life as we know it is universally based on some combination of carbon compounds, but what if life exists based on another element? For instance, silicon."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Mccoy,,"You're creating fantasies, Mister Spock."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,"Not necessarily, Bones. I've heard of the theoretical possibility of life based on silicon. A silicon-based life would be of an entirely different order. It's possible that our phasers might not affect it."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,,"Certainly not phaser one, which is far less powerful than phaser two."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,"All right, how about this? A creature that lives deep in the planet below us, at home in solid rock. It seems to me that in order to survive, it would have to have some form of natural armour plating."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,,"It could explain much, especially since the colonists are armed only with phaser one."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,But our people have phaser number two.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,,Which I could adjust to be more effective against silicon.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Mccoy,,"Silicon-based life is physiologically impossible, especially in an oxygen atmosphere."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,,"It may be, Doctor, that the creature can exist for brief periods in such an atmosphere before returning to its own environment."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Mccoy,,I still think you're imagining things.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,"You may be right, Doctor, but at least it's something to go on. Mister Spock, have Lieutenant Commander Giotto assemble the security troops and arm them with phaser number two. You make the proper adjustments. You seem fascinated by this rock."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,,"Yes, Captain. You recall that Vanderberg commented there were thousands of these at a lower level, the level which the machinery opened just prior to the first appearance of the creature."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,Do they tie in?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,,I don't know.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,Speculate.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,,I have already given Doctor McCoy sufficient cause for amusement. I'd prefer to cogitate the possibilities for a time.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,"A short time, Mister Spock. We have very little."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Kirk,,"How's it going, Scotty?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Scott,,"Well sir, it's a plumber's nightmare, but it'll hold for a bit."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Kirk,,It has to hold longer than a bit.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Scott,,"Sorry, sir. That's about the best I can do, but I guarantee it's not good enough."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Kirk,answers comm. beep,Kirk here.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Spock,,"Captain, the security officers have gathered in Chief Vanderberg's office."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Kirk,,"I'll be right there. Kirk out. Scotty, ride herd on it. Kind words. Tender, loving care. Kiss it. Baby it. Flatter it if you have to, but keep it going."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Scott,,"I'll do what I can, sir."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,,Six red-shirted men are lined up.,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,"You will proceed from level to level, checking out every foot, every opening. You are searching for some sort of creature which is highly resistant to phaser fire. Phasers will be set on maximum, and remember this. Fifty people have died. I want no more deaths."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,Except the bloody thing.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,"The creature may or may not attack on sight. However, you must. It is vitally important we get this installation back into production."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Spock,,"Mister Vanderberg, may I ask at which level you discovered the nodules of silicon?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,The twenty-third. Why?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Narrator,,"Commander Giotto, take your detail. Go directly to the twenty-third level. Start your search there."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Giotto,,"Aye, aye, sir. May I ask if you have reason to suspect this creature may be on that level?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,"It's one of the possibilities we've discussed. (to Vanderberg) I want your people to stay on the top level, together at a safe place."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,"I don't know any safe place, Captain, the way that thing comes and goes."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Kirk,,"Well, gentlemen, you have your instructions. Let's get at it."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,,The Starfleet people walk carefully along wonderfully smooth floors with just the occasional piece of equipment strewn around. Spock stops to use his tricorder on a section of the tunnel wall.,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,Mister Spock? Find something?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,"Adjusting my tricorder to register for silicon, Captain. Interesting."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,Traces?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,"A life form, Captain. Bearing one hundred eleven degrees, elevation four degrees."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,One of our people?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,"No, sir. Silicon."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,Come on.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,,The security team have gradually split up to cover all the different tunnels. A young blond lad manages a scream before meeting his fate.,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,"He never even had a chance to fire, Captain."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,It's only been seconds since we heard him scream. The creature must still be around.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,Captain.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Narrator,,KIRK What is it?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,"This tunnel. My readings indicate it was made within the hour. Moments ago, in fact."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,Are you certain?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,Positive.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,"This tunnel goes back as far as the eye can see. Our best machinery couldn't cut a tunnel like this, not even with phasers."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,"Indeed, Captain. I'm quite at a loss."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,,"Then they turn to see their adversary, and both fire their phasers at it. The shaggy creature shuffles off back into another of its nice circular tunnels and vanishes.",
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,Gone.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,Disappeared. Astonishing that anything of that bulk could move so rapidly.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,These walls are hot.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,Indeed. This tunnel was cut within the last two minutes.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,,Giotto and another security man arrive.,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Narrator,,"GIOTTO Are you all right, Captain?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,"Yes, perfectly."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Giotto,,Did you see it?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,"Yes, we saw it. Where does the tunnel go?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,Readings indicate a maze of tunnels of this general category in that direction.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Giotto,,Did you shoot at it?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,Yes. We took a bite out of it.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,,Spock picks up the piece of 'armour' they had cut off the creature,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,It's not animal tissue. What is it?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,"The closest approximation I could come to would be fibrous asbestos. A mineral, Captain."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,Then your guess was right.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,It would seem so. Silicon-based.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,Summation.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,"We are dealing with a silicon creature of the deep rocks, capable of moving through solid rock as easily as we move through the air."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,That would account for the tunnels.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,Correct. This creature's body secretes an extremely powerful corrosive.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,Powerful enough to dissolve the door of the reactor chamber.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,And it explains the murdered men.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,"It's definitely phaser resistant. We had our weapons set for silicon and on full power, yet we only damaged it. It still lives."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Narrator,,GIOTTO You mean it's impossible to kill?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,"No. No, it might require amassed phasers."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,Or a single phaser with much longer contact.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,"Commander, pass this on to your men We knew it was a killer. Now it's wounded, probably in pain somewhere back there. There's nothing more dangerous than a wounded animal. Commander Giotto, instruct your men to concentrate the search in this sector. Remind them the creature is wounded."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Giotto,,"Aye, aye, sir."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,,leaves,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,"What is it, Mister Spock?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,"I've run a complete spherical check on all life forms, radius one hundred miles. I've located our men, all of them, and I've located one creature moving rapidly through native rock, bearing two hundred and one. And that is all."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,One creature in a hundred miles?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,"Exactly. Captain, there are literally thousands of these tunnels in this general area alone, far too many to be cut by the one creature in an ordinary lifetime."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,"Then we're dealing with more than one creature, despite your tricorder readings, or we have a creature with an extremely long life span."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,"Or it is the last of a race of creatures which made these tunnels. If so, if it is the only survivor of a dead race, to kill it would be a crime against science."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, our mission is to protect this colony, to get the pergium moving again. This is not a zoological expedition. Maintain a constant reading on the creature. If we have to, we'll use phasers to cut our own tunnels. We'll try to surround it. I'm sorry, Mister Spock, but I'm afraid the creature must die."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Spock,,"I see no alternative myself, Captain. It merely seems a pity. The search team is gathering in the main tunnel."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnels,Kirk,,Good.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,,Giotto now has seven red-shirts with him.,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Kirk,,"So it is wounded, and therefore twice as dangerous. Stay in pairs. If you see it, concentrate your phaser fire at what appears to be its head. Concentrate it. Maintain it. It is definitely resistant, but it can be hurt. And if it can be hurt, it can be killed. Mister Spock."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Spock,,"Gentlemen, if you'll examine your charts, please. I last located the creature in the area marked adit26 moving in bearing two zero one. This particular group will move out beyond that area in all directions in an effort to surround it, and possibly capture it."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Kirk,,"Your orders are shoot to kill. Protect yourself at all times. Commander Giotto, disperse your search parties."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Giotto,,"Aye, aye, sir. Louis, Vinci, take your men out."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,,The red-shirts leave.,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Kirk,,Mister Spock. Capture it? I don't recall giving any such order.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Spock,,"You did not, sir. I merely thought that if the opportunity arose"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Kirk,,I will lose no more men. The creature will be killed on sight and that's the end of it.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Spock,,"Very well, sir."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Kirk,,Mister Spock. I want you to assist Scotty in maintaining that makeshift circulating pump.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Spock,,"II beg your pardon, sir?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Kirk,,You heard me. It's vital that we keep that reactor in operation. Your scientific knowledge
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Spock,,"Is not needed there, sir. Mister Scott has far more knowledge of nuclear reactors than I do. You're aware of that."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, you are second in command. This will be a dangerous hunt. Either one of us by himself is expendable. Both of us are not."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Spock,,"Captain, there are approximately one hundred of us engaged in this search, against one creature. The odds against you and I both being killed are 2,228.7 to 1."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Kirk,,"2,228.7 to 1? Those are pretty good odds, Mister Spock."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Spock,,"And they are of course accurate, Captain."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Kirk,,"Of course. Well, I hate to use the word, but logically, with those kind of odds, you might as well stay. But please stay out of trouble, Mister Spock."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Spock,,"That is always my intention, Captain."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,,A communicator beeps,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Kirk,,Kirk here.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Scott,,"Scotty here, Captain. My brilliant improvisation Just gave up the ghost. It couldn't stand the strain."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Kirk,,Can you fix it again?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Scott,,"Negative, Captain. It's gone for good."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Kirk,,Start immediate evacuation of all colonists to the Enterprise.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Vanderberg,,"Not all of them, Captain. I and some of my key personnel are staying."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Vanderberg,,We'll be down to join you.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Kirk,,We haven't enough phasers for you.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Vanderberg,,Then we'll use clubs. We're not being chased away from here. We're staying.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Kirk,,"Good. Get everybody else aboard the Enterprise. The fewer people we have breathing the air down here, the longer the rest of us will be able to hold out. How much longer, Scotty?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,reactor room,Scott,,"The reactor will go super-critical in about ten hours, Sir. You have that long to find the mechanism."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,main tunnel,Kirk,,"We'll do our best. Start feeding us constant status reports, Scotty. Vanderberg, you and your crew assemble at level twenty three, checkpoint Tiger. Kirk out."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,,"Vanderberg, Appel and three others are there.",
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,Kirk,,"Team up with the Enterprise security personnel. They're better armed than you. Keep someone in sight at all times. Vanderberg, take two men. Go through that tunnel there. Rendezvous with Commander Giotto. Appel and the rest of the men, go through there and tie up with Lieutenant Osborne's detail. Mister Spock and I will control the operation from a central point. That's all."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,,The miners leave.,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,Kirk,,Mister Spock?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,Spock,,"Captain, we are being watched."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,Kirk,,Are you sure? Intuition?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,Spock,,"No, sir. We're being watched."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,,They start to move through the tunnels,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,Spock,,Captain. Fresh readings within the hour in each of these tunnels.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,Kirk,,The chart says both of these tunnels converge a few thousand yards further. You take the left. I'll take the right.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,Spock,,Should we separate?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,Kirk,,"Two tunnels, two of us. We separate."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,,"Kirk walks off down a real tunnel, while Spock has to hunch down to move through one of the new circular tunnels. Further on, Kirk's tunnel becomes circular too, then it opens into an area with flat floor, equipment and silicon nodules.",
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,Mister Spock.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnel,Spock,,"Yes, Captain."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"I've found a whole layer of these silicon nodules of yours, hundreds of them."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,"Indeed? I find that most illuminating, Captain."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnel,Spock,,Be absolutely certain you do not damage any of them.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,Explain.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,Only a theory I have.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,,"We see something move a roof support, and rocks fall near Kirk.",
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnel,Spock,,Captain? Are you all right? Jim? Jim!
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"Yes, Mister Spock, I'm all right. We seem to have had a cave-in."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnel,Spock,,I could phaser you out.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnel,Kirk,,"No. No, no, you'd better not. Any disturbance might bring down the rest of the wall."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"Besides, it isn't necessary. The chart said the tunnels meet further on."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnel,Spock,,"Very well, but I find it extremely disquieting that your roof chose that particular moment to collapse. Please proceed with extreme caution. I shall quicken my pace."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"Very well, Mister Spock. I'll meet you at the other end."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,,"Just then a part of the wall vanishes, and their strange adversary emerges. The pair have a stand off, with the creature approaching when Kirk lowers his phaser, and backing off when he raises it. The communicator beeps.) KIRK: Kirk here",
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnel,Spock,,"Captain, I just read some fresh signs."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,The creature is in this area. I'll take a lifeform reading.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"It's not necessary, Mister Spock. I know exactly where the creature is."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnel,Spock,,"Where, Captain?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,Ten feet away from me.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnel,Spock,,"Kill it, Captain, quickly."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"It's not making any threatening moves, Spock."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnel,Spock,,"You don't dare take the chance, Captain."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,Kill it.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"I thought you were the one who wanted it kept alive, captured if possible."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnel,Spock,,"Jim, your life is in danger. You can't take the risk."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,It seems to be waiting.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,tunnel,Spock,,I remind you it's a proven killer. I'm on my way. Spock out.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,sitting down,"Well, what do we do, just talk it over?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,,The creature turns to show it's wound from their last encounter.,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"Well, you can be hurt, can't you? We just sit here? It's your move."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,,Spock comes running in and takes aim,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"No, no! Don't shoot. Come on over, Mister Spock."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,,"He does so, and squats by the Captain.",
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,Fascinating. It's made no moves against you?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"No. It seems to be waiting. I tried talking to it, but it didn't do any good."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,,Spock points at a pile of silicon nodules.,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"Yes, they're all through here, all over the place. Thousands of them."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,"Yes, I see."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,Does it means something to you?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,"Possibly the answer, Captain, but I'm not certain. Captain, you are aware of the Vulcan technique of the joining of two minds."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,You think you can get through to that thing?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,It's possible.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, I know it's a terrible personal lowering of mental barriers but if there's a chance"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,I'll try.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,,"He fastens his phaser to his belt and carefully approaches the worried creature. Without touching, he concentrates for a moment and then cries out.",
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,"Pain! Pain! Pain! (he staggers back) That's all I got, Captain. Waves and waves of searing pain. It's in agony."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,,The creature climbs onto a rock ledge and etches letters into it.,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"No kill I. What is that, a plea for us not to kill it, or a promise that it won't kill us?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,"I don't know, Captain. Evidently, it gained an immediate knowledge of us from its empathy with me. In my brief contact with the creature's mind, I discovered it is a highly intelligent, extremely sophisticated animal. In great pain, of course, because of its wound, but not reacting at all like a wounded creature. It calls itself a Horta."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"A Horta. A Horta! Mister Spock, we need that retardation mechanism. You must re-establish communications with it."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,"Captain, it has no reason to give us the device, and apparently every reason for wishing us off this planet."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"Yes, I'm aware of that. If we could only win its confidence. Doctor McCoy, this is Captain Kirk."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Mccoy,,"Yes, Captain?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,Grab your medical kit and come down here on the double. I've got a patient for you.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Mccoy,,Is somebody injured? What happened?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,Never mind. Just come down to the twenty third level. You'll be led to us by tricorder readings. Kirk out.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,"Jim, I remind you that this is a silicon-based form of life. Doctor McCoy's medical knowledge will be totally useless."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"He's a healer, let him heal. Mister Spock, you must re-establish communications. I want to know why it suddenly took to murder."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,"To obtain that kind of communication, Captain, it will be necessary to touch it."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,We've seen how the creature destroys.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,,Kirk stands ready with his phaser as Spock carefully places his hands on the quivering Horta.,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,Lieutenant Commander Giotto.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Giotto,,"Giotto here, Captain. Are you all right?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,Perfectly all right. Where are you?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,Giotto,,"We're at the end of the tunnel. Mister Vanderberg and his men are here, and they're pretty ugly. Shall I let them through?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"Under no circumstances allow them in here yet. The minute Doc McCoy gets there, send him through."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,Giotto,,"Aye, aye, sir."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,Murder. Of thousands. Devils! Eternity ends. The chamber of the ages. The altar of tomorrow! Murderers! Stop them. Kill! Strike back! Monsters!
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,,McCoy runs in,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Mccoy,,What in the name of? What is Spock doing?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,It's wounded. Badly. You've got to help it.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Mccoy,,Help that?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,Go take a look.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,,McCoy kneels by the wound and gets out his tricorder.,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,The end of life. Murderers.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Mccoy,,You can't be serious. That thing is virtually made out of stone!
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,Help it. Treat it.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Mccoy,,"I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,You're a healer. There's a patient. That's an order. Mister Spock. Tell it we're trying to help. The mechanism.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,"Understood. It is the end of life. Eternity stops. Go out into the tunnel. To the chamber of the ages. Cry for the children. Walk carefully in the vault of tomorrow. Sorrow for the murdered children. The thing you search for is there. Go. Go. Sadness. Sadness for the end of things. Go into the tunnel. There is a passageway. Quickly, quickly."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,,Kirk heads off down the tunnel the Horta came out of.,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,Giotto,,"The Captain said for you to wait here, and here is where you'll wait."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,Appel,,That murdering monster's in there and we're going to kill it.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,Giotto,,You're going to stay here.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,the chamber of the ages,,"Kirk emerges into an area filled with silicon nodules, both whole and broken.",
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Mccoy,into communicator,"That's right, Lieutenant. Just beam it down to me immediately, and never mind what I want it for. I just want it! Now move!"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,channeling the Horta,It is time to sleep. It is over. Failure. The murderers have won. Death is welcome. Let it end here.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"Mister Spock. Mister Spock. Spock. Spock! Come out of it. I found the unit in there. It's in pretty good shape. I also found about a million of these silicon nodules. They're eggs, aren't they?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,"Yes, Captain, eggs and about to hatch."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,The miners must have broken into the hatchery. Their operations destroyed thousands of them. No wonder.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,Appel,,There. They're coming.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,,"He knocks out Giotto and the miners overpower the rest of the red-shirts, clubbing them viciously.",
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,Appel,,"All right! All right, let's go!"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,level twenty three,Vanderberg,,Come on.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"How are you doing, Doc?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Mccoy,,I'll let you know.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,,The miners come round the corner.,
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,Don't fire. First man that fires is dead.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Vanderberg,,That thing has killed fifty of my men.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,You've killed thousands of her children.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Vanderberg,,What?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"Those round silicon nodules that you've been collecting and destroying? They're her eggs. Tell them, Mister Spock."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,"There have been many generations of Horta on this planet. Every fifty thousand years, the entire race dies, all but one, like this one, but the eggs live. She cares for them, protects them. And when they hatch, she is the mother to them, thousands of them. This creature here is the mother of her race."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"The Horta is intelligent, peaceful, mild. She had no objection to sharing this planet with you, till you broke into her nursery and started destroying her eggs. Then she fought back in the only way she knew how, as any mother would fight when her children are in danger."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Vanderberg,,"We didn't know. How could we? You mean if these eggs hatch, there'll be thousands of those things crawling around down here?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"This is where they live. They digest rock, they tunnel for nourishment."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,And they are the most inoffensive of creatures. They harbour ill will towards no one.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Appel,,"Now look, we have pergium to deliver."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"Yes, I know. Here's your circulating pump. You've complained this planet is a mineralogical treasure house if you had the equipment to get at it. Gentlemen, the Horta moves through rock the way we move through air, and it leaves tunnels. The greatest natural miners in the universe. It seems to me we could make an agreement, reach a modus vivendi. They tunnel. You collect and process, and your process operation would be a thousand times more profitable."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Vanderberg,,"Sounds all right, if it will work."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,Except for one thing. The Horta is badly wounded. It may die.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Mccoy,,"It won't die. By golly, Jim, I'm beginning to think I can cure a rainy day."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,Can you help it?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Mccoy,,Help it? I cured it.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,How?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Mccoy,,"Well, I had the ship beam down a hundred pounds of that thermoconcrete. You know, the kind we use to build emergency shelters out of. It's mostly silicone. So I just trowelled it into the wound, and it'll act like a bandage until it heals. Take a look. It's as good as new."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Kirk,,"Well, Spock, I'm going to have to ask you to get in touch with the Horta again. Tell her our proposition. She and her children can do all the tunnelling they want. Our people will remove the minerals, and each side will leave the other alone. Think she'll go for it?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,cavern,Spock,,"It seems logical, Captain. The Horta has a very logical mind. And after close association with humans, I find that curiously refreshing."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Spock,,"Ship ready to leave orbit, Captain. Course laid in."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Kirk,,"Very good, Mister Spock."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Spock,,Chief Engineer Vanderberg standing by on channel one.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Kirk,,"Fine. Yes, Chief. Kirk here."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,"Just wanted to tell you the eggs have started to hatch, Captain."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Vanderberg,,First thing the little devils do is start to tunnel.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,We've already hit huge new pergium deposits. I'm afraid to tell you how much gold and platinum and rare earths we've uncovered.
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Kirk,,"I'm delighted to hear that, Chief. Once Mother Horta tells her kids what to look for, you people are going to be embarrassingly rich."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Vanderberg,,"You know, the Horta aren't so bad once you're used to their appearance."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,vanderberg's office,Vanderberg,,"Well. that's about it, Kirk. Thanks for everything."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Kirk,,"Our pleasure, Chief. Kirk out."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Spock,,"Curious. What Chief Vanderberg said about the Horta is exactly what the Mother Horta said to me. She found humanoid appearance revolting, but she thought she could get used to it."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Mccoy,,"Oh, she did, did she? Now tell me, did she happen to make any comment about those ears?"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Spock,,"Not specifically, but I did get the distinct impression she found them the most attractive human characteristic of all. I didn't have the heart to tell her that only I have"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Kirk,,She really liked those ears?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, the Horta is a remarkably intelligent and sensitive creature, with impeccable taste."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Kirk,,Because she approved of you?
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Spock,,"Really, Captain, my modesty"
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Kirk,,"Does not bear close examination, Mister Spock. I suspect you're becoming more and more human all the time."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, I see no reason to stand here and be insulted."
26,1,The Devil In The Dark,bridge,Kirk,,"Ahead, warp factor two."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, we've reached the designated position for scanning the coded directive tape."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,Good. (puts it into a decoder) We both guessed right. Negotiations with the Klingon Empire are on the verge of breaking down. Starfleet Command anticipates a surprise attack. We are to proceed to Organia and take whatever steps are necessary to prevent the Klingons from using it as a base.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Spock,,"Strategically sound. Organia is the only Class M planet in the disputed area, ideally located for use by either side."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,"Organia's description, Mister Spock."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Spock,,"Inhabited by humanoids. A very peaceful, friendly people living on a primitive level. Little of intrinsic value. Approximately Class D minus on Richter's scale of cultures."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,"Another Armenia, Belgium."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Spock,,Sir?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,The weak innocents who always seem to be located on the natural invasion routes.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, the automatic deflector screen just popped on. Body approaching."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,"Configuration, Mister Sulu."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,,Everyone is thrown about as the Enterprise is hit by multiple weapons fire.,
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,"Phaser banks, lock on. Return fire. Maintain firing rate. One hundred percent dispersal pattern."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Spock,,"We've hit him, Captain. He's hurt."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,"Damage control, report to the first officer."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, the other ship doesn't register. Only drifting debris. We got him."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,"All hands, maintain general alert. Hold battle stations. Damage report, Mister Spock."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Spock,,"Minor, Captain. We were most fortunate. Blast damage in decks ten and eleven, minor buckling in the antimatter pods, casualties very light."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,"Maintain surveillance, Mister Sulu."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Sulu,,"No contact, Captain. He blew up all right."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,"Well, we've been anticipating an attack. I'd say what we've just experienced very nearly qualifies."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Spock,,Yes. It would seem to be an unfriendly act.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Uhura,,"Automatic all-points relay from Starfleet Command, Captain, code one."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,"Well, there it is. War. We didn't want it, but we've got it."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Spock,,Curious how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do not want.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,"War or not, we've still got a job to do. Denying Organia to the Klingons."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Spock,,"With the outbreak of hostilities, that might not be easy."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,"Lay in a course for Organia, Mister Sulu."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, aye, sir."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Spock,,"Negotiating with the Organians will be time-consuming, Captain, and time is one thing we'll have the least of."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,We won't get it by talking about it. The trigger's been pulled. We have to get there before the hammer falls. Ahead warp factor seven.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 3198.4. We have reached Organia and established standard orbit. No signs of hostile activities in this area."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain. Unit XY-75847 report a fleet of Klingon ships in their sector, sir."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,What bearing?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Uhura,,"Unable to ascertain, sir."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Sulu, have the phaser crews stand by their positions. Full power deflector screens."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Sulu,,"Yes, sir."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock and I are going to the planet's surface. You will be in command. Your responsibility is to the Enterprise, not to us. Is that clear?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Sulu,,"Perfectly, sir."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,The Klingon fleet is in this quadrant. We know that Organia will be a target. If they should emerge
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Sulu,,"We'll handle them, sir."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,"You will evaluate the situation. If there is a fleet of them, you'll get out of here, Mister Sulu."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Sulu,,"But, Captain"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,"No buts. You'll get to safety and alert the fleet. You will not attack alone. Mister Spock and I will be all right. Mister Spock, let's you and I pay the Organians a visit."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,planet surface,,"They beam down in front of a vaguely castle-styled wall which is completely smooth. The locals are dressed in romanticised rural mediaeval-style clothing, and take no notice of them at all.",
27,1,Errand of Mercy,planet surface,Kirk,,You'd think they had people beaming down every day.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,planet surface,Spock,,"Yes. Curious lack of interest. Notice the ruins in the distance, Captain. Quite large."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,planet surface,Kirk,,"Yes. A fortress, perhaps. A castle."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,planet surface,Spock,,"Whatever it is, it would seem to be inconsistent with the reports we've been given on this culture."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,planet surface,,A man in a loose purple robe opens his arms wide.,
27,1,Errand of Mercy,planet surface,Ayelborne,,Welcome.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,planet surface,Kirk,,Reception committee?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,planet surface,Spock,,It would seem so.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,planet surface,Ayelborne,,"You are our visitors. Welcome, welcome. I am Ayelborne."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,planet surface,Kirk,,"I am Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets. This is my first officer Mister Spock."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,planet surface,Ayelborne,,"You are most welcome, my friend."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,planet surface,Kirk,,I would like to speak to someone in authority.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,planet surface,Ayelborne,,"We don't have anybody in authority, but I am the chairman of the Council of Elders. Perhaps I would do."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,planet surface,Kirk,,You people are in great danger. Is there someplace we can go and talk?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,planet surface,Ayelborne,,"Oh, yes. Our council chambers are nearby. Please."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,planet surface,Spock,,"Captain, if you don't mind, I should like to wander about the village and make some studies."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,planet surface,Ayelborne,,"Of course, my friend. Our village is yours. Captain."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,,"Ayelborne and four other older men seat themselves at a simple wooden table. Beautifully polished, though.",
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"Gentlemen, my government has informed me that the Klingons are expected to move against your planet with the objective of making it a base of operation against the Federation. My mission, frankly, is to keep them from doing it."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"What you're saying, Captain, is that we seem to have a choice between dealing with you or your enemies."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"No, sir. With the Federation, you have a choice. You have none with the Klingons. The Klingons are a military dictatorship. War is their way of life. Life under the Klingon rule would be very unpleasant. We offer you protection."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Claymare,,"We thank you for your altruistic offer, Captain, but we really do not need your protection."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"We are a simple people, Captain. We have nothing that anybody could want."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"You have this planet and its strategic location. I assure you that if you don't take action to prevent it, the Klingons will move against you as surely as your sun rises. We will help you build defences, build facilities."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"We have no defences, Captain, nor are any needed."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"Gentlemen, I have seen what the Klingons do to planets like yours. They are organised into vast slave labour camps. No freedoms whatsoever. Your goods will be confiscated. Hostages taken and killed, your leaders confined. You'd be far better off on a penal planet. Infinitely better off."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"Captain, we see that your concern is genuine. We are moved. But again we assure you we are in absolutely no danger. If anybody is in danger, you are, and that concerns us greatly. It would be better if you returned to your ship as soon as possible."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,You keep insisting there's no danger. I keep assuring you there is. Would you mind telling me
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"It is our way of life, Captain."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"That's the first thing that would be lost! Excuse me, gentlemen. I'm a soldier, not a diplomat. I can only tell you the truth."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"If you will excuse us, Captain, we will discuss your kind offer."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,Certainly.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,,The doors open on their own and Spock enters. He and Kirk whisper in a corner.,
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Spock,,"Captain, our information on these people and their culture was not correct. This is not a primitive society making progress toward mechanisation. They are totally stagnant. There is no evidence of any progress as far back as my tricorder can register."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,That doesn't seem likely.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Spock,,"Nevertheless, it is true. For tens of thousands of years, there has been absolutely no advancement, no significant change in their physical environment. This is a laboratory specimen of an arrested culture."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"Thank you, Mister Spock. That might be useful."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"We have discussed your offer, Captain. Our opinion is unchanged. We are in no danger. We thank you for your kind offer of assistance, although we must decline it, and we strongly recommend that you leave Organia before you yourselves are endangered."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"Gentlemen, I must get you to reconsider. We can be of immense help to you. In addition to military aid, we can send you specialists, technicians. We can show you how to feed a thousand people where one was fed before. We can help you build schools, educate the young in the latest technological and scientific skills. Your public facilities are almost non-existent. We can help you remake your world, end disease, hunger, hardship. All we ask in return is that you let us help you. Now."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"Captain, I can see that you do not understand us. Perhaps"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,answering communicator,"Excuse me, sir. Kirk here."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Sulu,,"Captain, a large number of Klingon vessels have just arrived."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Sulu,,They're opening fire.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,Positive identification?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Sulu,,"Yes, sir. My screens are up. I can't drop them to beam you aboard."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"Mister Sulu, follow your orders. Get out of here. Contact the fleet. Return if the odds are more equal. Kirk out. Gentlemen, you kept insisting that there was no danger"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"That is correct, Captain. There is no danger."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Trefayne,,"Ayelborne, eight space vehicles have assumed orbit around our planet. They are activating their material transmission units."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"Thank you, Trefayne."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,Can you verify that?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Spock,,"Negative, Captain, but it seems a logical development."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"Captain, since it is too late for you to escape, perhaps we should do something about protecting you."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,If you had listened to me
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Claymare,,We must be sure you are not harmed.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Trefayne,,"Ayelborne, several hundred men have appeared near the citadel. They bring many weapons."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,How does he know that?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"Oh, our friend Trefayne is really quite intuitive. You can rest assured that what he says is absolutely correct."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"So we're stranded here, in the middle of a Klingon occupation army."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Spock,,So it would seem. Not a very pleasant prospect.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"You have a gift for understatement, Mister Spock. It's not a very pleasant prospect at all."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Narrator,,"Captain's Log. stardate 3201.7. Mister Spock and I are trapped on the planet Organia, which is in the process of being occupied by the forces of the Klingon Empire. The Organians have provided us with native clothing in the hopes we may be taken for Organians."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Spock,,"Captain, our phasers are gone."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,Did you take them?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"Yes, Captain. I took them."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,I must ask you to return them.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"I'm sorry, Captain. I cannot do that. Were you armed, you might be tempted to use violence, and that we cannot permit. You, Captain, will pass as an Organian, and Mister Spock. Mister Spock presents a problem. He doesn't look like an Organian."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Claymare,,"A Vulcan trader, perhaps. A dealer in kevas and trillium. Harmless to the Klingons."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,They know that Vulcan is a member of the Federation.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Spock,,"Vulcan merchants are not uncommon, Captain. It is a practical approach."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,What about the rest of you?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,We shall continue as before. We have nothing to fear.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"You have a lot to learn, sir. And if I know the Klingons, you'll be learning it the hard way."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,,"The doors open on their own, and two Klingons march in, followed by their leader.",
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,This is the ruling council?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"I am Ayelborne, temporary head of the council. I bid you welcome."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,"No doubt you do. I am Kor, military governor of Organia. (looking at Kirk) Who are you?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"He is Baroner, one of our leading citizens."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,And he has no tongue?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,I have a tongue.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,Good. You will be taught how to use it. Where is your smile?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,My what?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,"The stupid, idiotic smile everyone else seems to be wearing. A Vulcan. Do you also have a tongue?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Spock,,"I am Spock, a dealer in kevas and trillium."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kos,,You do not look like a storekeeper. Take this man. Vulcans are members of the Federation. He may be a spy.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,He's no spy.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,"Well, have we a ram among the sheep? Do you object to us taking him?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,He's done nothing. Nothing at all.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,"Coming from an Organian, yours is practically an act of rebellion. Very good. (to the Council) So you welcome me. (to Kirk) Do you also welcome me?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,You're here. There's nothing I can do about it.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,"Good honest hatred. Very refreshing. However, it makes no difference whether you welcome me or not. I am here and will stay. You are now subjects of the Klingon Empire. You'll find there are many rules and regulations. They will be posted. Violation of the smallest of them will be punished by death."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"We shall obey your regulations, Commander."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,"You disapprove, Baroner."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,You need my approval?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,I need your obedience. Nothing more. Will I have it?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,You seem to be in command.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,"Yes. I am. I shall need a representative from among you. Liaison between the forces of the occupation and the civil population. Smile and smile. I don't trust men who smile too much. You, Baroner, you're the man."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,Me? I don't want the job.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,"Have I asked whether or not you want it? We Klingons have a reputation for ruthlessness. You will find that it is deserved. Should one Klingon soldier be killed, a thousand Organians will die. I will have order. Is that clear?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"Commander, I assure you our people want nothing but peace. We shall cause you no trouble."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,"I'm sure you will not. Take the Vulcan to the examination room. (to Kirk) You, come with me. I will familiarise you with your new duties."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,And Mister Spock?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,You are concerned?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,He is my friend.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,"You have a poor choice of friends. He will be examined. If he is lying, he will die. If he is telling the truth, he will find that business has taken a turn for the worse. Take him. You do not like to be pushed. Very good. You may be a man I can deal with, Baroner. Come with me."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,,Probably up in the old castle.,
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"From this day on, no public assemblages of more than three people. All publications to be cleared through this office. Neighbourhood controls will be established, hostages selected. A somewhat lengthy list of crimes against the state."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,,"Kor hands the proclamation to Kirk, who puts it down on the desk.",
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,You do not like them? (Spock is brought in.) Well?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Klingon,,"He is what he claims to be, Commander, a Vulcanian merchant named Spock. His main concern seems to be how he would carry out his business under our occupation."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,Nothing else?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Klingon,,The usual. A certain amount of apprehension regarding us. The mind is remarkably disciplined.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,You are sure?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Klingon,,"I used force four, which is sufficient to break down any pretence."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"Very well, Lieutenant. Would you like to try our little truth finder?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,I don't understand.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"It's a mind-sifter or mind-ripper, depending on how much force is used. We can record every thought, every bit of knowledge in a man's mind. Of course, when that much force is used, the mind is emptied. Permanently, I'm afraid. What's left is more vegetable than human."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,And you're proud of it.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"It is a tool, a weapon. Somewhat drastic, but very efficient."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,Are you sure you're all right?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Spock,,"Perfectly, Baroner. But it was an interesting experience."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"All right, Vulcan, you may go. But you are an enemy alien. You will be under our scrutiny at all times. If I have to warn you"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Spock,,"Not necessary, Commander. I understand you very well."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,,"He leaves, followed by the guard.",
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"Return to your council, Baroner. You will receive our official notifications as soon as they are published. In the meantime keep the people in order. It is your responsibility."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,Or I will be killed.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,That is exactly right. You will be killed.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Kirk,,That mindsifter can't be all the terror they think it is.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Spock,,"It should not be underestimated, Captain. It reaches directly into the mind. We Vulcans have certain mental (a Klingon walks past) certain disciplines which enable me to maintain a shield. Without those disciplines, there would be no protection."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Kirk,,I'll try and avoid it.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Klingon 2,,"Out of the way, Organian."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Spock,,"I'm sorry, sir. We did not notice you."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Klingon 2,,"Next time, keep your eyes open, or I'll shut them permanently."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Spock,,"Captain, I strongly suggest we direct our energies toward the immediate problem. Accomplishing our mission here."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Kirk,,"You didn't really think I was going to beat his head in, did you?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Spock,,I thought you might.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Kirk,,"You're right. But as you say, we still have a job to do."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Spock,,We'll receive no help from the Organians.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Kirk,,"Maybe, but sooner or later they'll start resenting how the Klingons run things. If we could prove to them they could do something to strike back, to keep the Klingons off balance."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Spock,,Verbal persuasion seems to be ineffective. Perhaps a more direct approach?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Kirk,,That's exactly what I had in mind. Mister Spock Did I or did I not see something that looked like a munitions dump outside of Kor's headquarters?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Spock,,You did.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Kirk,,I think it's time we did a little simple and plain communicating. Tonight.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Spock,,"A very meritorious idea, Captain."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Kirk,,We're short of tools.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,village square,Spock,,"I'm certain the Klingons will provide whatever is necessary. It's a pleasure doing business with you, Mister Spock."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,,"Kirk jumps one Klingon and hauls his unconscious body away. Spock primes a grenade, presumably from the munitions dump.",
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,Kirk,,Okay so far. Sonic grenade?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,Spock,,With a delayed action fuse.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,Narrator,,KIRK; Good.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,Spock,,These crates contain chemical explosives. They should make a most satisfactory display.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,,"He casually drops the grenade into a box, and they run.",
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,Spock,,"Six, five, four three."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,,There's a short but bright fireworks show.,
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,Kirk,,"You were right, Mister Spock. A most satisfactory display."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,Of course we blew it up. Deliberately.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,But that was violence.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"We did it to show you that you can fight back. You don't have to be sheep, you can be wolves."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Claymare,,Terrible to destroy.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"History is full of examples of civil populations fighting back successfully against a military dictatorship. We may not be able to destroy the Klingons, but we can tie them up. Blow up their installations, disrupt their communications, make Organia useless to them."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Spock,,"Our fleet will eventually arrive. In the meantime, the battle is ours. It can be a successful one."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"Captain, I implore you never to do such a thing again."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,Why? Are you afraid of retribution? Does your personal freedom mean so little to you?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"How little you understand us, Captain."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,All I understand is that you apparently don't have the backbone to fight and protect your loved ones.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,,Of course he had the Council Chamber bugged.,
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,"I speak of courage, gentlemen. Does courage mean so little to you?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,,Kor and his troops enter.,
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,You speak of courage. Obviously you do not know the difference between courage and foolhardiness. Always it is the brave ones who die. The soldiers. I hope you will continue to savour the sweetness of your life. You disgust me.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"What are you going to do with him, Commander?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,"What is always done with spies and saboteurs. He will be killed, after he has had first-hand experience of our mind scanner."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"There's no need to use your machine on him, commander. I can tell you his name. It is Captain James T. Kirk."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,Ayelborne!
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,"What? (A big grin spreads across his face) Captain of the USS Enterprise. A starship commander. And his first officer? I had hoped to meet you in battle, but"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"For some reason, he feels that he must destroy you, Commander, just as you feel you must destroy him."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,"That's going to be rather difficult now. Isn't it, Captain? What an admirable people. Do you always betray your friends?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"I didn't want you to harm him. I'm sorry, Captain. It was for the best. No harm would come of it."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"I'm used to the idea of dying, but I have no desire to die for the likes of you."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,"I don't blame you, Captain. Lock up the Vulcan. Take the Captain to my office. We'll have a talk before I do what must be done."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"You'll have a drink with me, Captain?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,"No, thank you."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"I assure you it isn't drugged. With our mind-scanner, we have no need for such crude methods."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,What do you want from me?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"Oh, a very great deal, but first I want to talk. Just talk."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,You think I'm going to sit here and just talk with the enemy?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"You'll talk. Either here, now, voluntarily, or under our mind-scanner. The fact is, Captain, I have a great admiration for your Starfleet. A remarkable instrument. and I must confess to a certain admiration for you. I know, of course, that it was you who destroyed our supplies last night."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,"Something was destroyed? Nothing inconsequential, I hope."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"Hardly. They were quite important to us, but they can be replaced. You of the Federation, you are much like us."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,We're nothing like you. We're a democratic body.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"Come now. I'm not referring to minor ideological differences. I mean that we are similar as a species. Here we are on a planet of sheep. Two tigers, predators, hunters, killers, and it is precisely that which makes us great. And there is a universe to be taken."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,"It's a very large universe, Commander, full of people who don't like the Klingons."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"Excellent. Then it shall be a matter of testing each other's wills. Of power. Survival must be earned, Captain. Tell me about the dispersal of your Starfleet."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,. Kirk,,Go climb a tree.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"I can get what I want through our mind-scanner, but there would be very little of your mind left, Captain. I have no desire to see you become a vegetable. This friend of yours, the Vulcan. He seems to have the ability to block our scanner. I think perhaps I will find out why. I will have him dissected. Your friend killed. You, a mental vegetable. Not a pleasant prospect, Captain, but it lies ahead for you unless you tell me everything I want to know. Twelve hours, Captain."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,"It will take a lot longer than that, Commander."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"Longer than that I will not wait. I respect you, Captain, but this is war, a game we Klingons play to win. Take him to the cell with his friend. And watch him closely."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,cell,,"It's a traditional mediaeval castle cell, big iron grills, straw on the floor, lit by ever-burning torches in sconces on the walls.",
27,1,Errand of Mercy,cell,Spock,,"It's no use, Jim. There's no way out."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,cell,,Later.,
27,1,Errand of Mercy,cell,Kirk,,How much of the twelve hours do we have left?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,cell,Spock,,"Six hours, forty three minutes, if the Klingons are punctual."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,cell,Kirk,,"I think we can count on them being punctual. Blowing that munitions dump wasn't enough. If we get out of here, we've got to carry the attack directly to Kor. These Organians"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,cell,Spock,,They do not seem to understand. Most peculiar.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,cell,Kirk,,"Nevertheless, our orders still stand. We've got to make some attempt to neutralise the Klingon occupation."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,cell,Spock,,"We may not get the chance, Captain. These walls are very thick."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,cell,Kirk,,And there are guards every few feet down the hall.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,cell,,"There are sounds outside, then the door swings silently open on it's own. Spock and Kirk are ready to pounce on whoever enters.",
27,1,Errand of Mercy,cell,Ayelborne,,"Oh, there you are, gentlemen. I trust you are in good health? Shall we go?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,cell,Kirk,,Go?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,cell,Ayelborne,,Yes. Your captors plan to do violence to you. That we cannot permit. I came to take you away.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,cell,Kirk,,You turned us over to them. You expect us to trust you now?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,cell,Ayelborne,,"Is there really a choice, Captain? I offer you safety."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,We can't stay here. This is the first place they'll look.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"They will not come here, Captain. You may believe me."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"First you turn us in, then get us out. What are you doing now, waiting for the Klingons to post a reward so you can turn us in again and collect it?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"How little you understand us, Captain."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Spock,,Nor do we understand what happened to the guard at the citadel.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,Please do not concern yourself about them.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,What happened to them?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"Why, nothing happened to them, Captain. Nothing at all."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Klingon,,Commander!
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,Don't you see I'm busy?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Klingon,,The two Federation prisoners. They're gone.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,You mean they've escaped?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Klingon,,"I swear. No one was at fault. The guards, ten of them were constantly on duty watching the cell. Then when they opened it to give them food, they simply weren't there, and there was no way out."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,If you're lying to me.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Klingon,,I swear!
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"All right, Lieutenant. Implement Special Occupation Order Number Four. Immediately!"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Klingon,,Sir!
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"Is that's all you can do, smile?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"You are free, Captain."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"I want to know how I'm free, and why."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Spock,,"Indeed, there are several questions I would like to ask as well."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"This idiotic placidity of yours, your refusal to do anything to protect yourselves"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"We have already answered that question. To us, violence is unthinkable."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,"Attention. Attention all Organians. Attention. This is Commander Kor. The two Federation prisoners have escaped, obviously with outside aid."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"They will be returned immediately. So that you will know we mean what we say, listen."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"Those are Klingon phasers. Take the door. Get down, gentlemen."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"In the courtyard of my headquarters,"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,Two hundred Organians have just been killed.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Narrator,,KIRK; Two hundred of them.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kor,,"In two hours, two hundred more will die, and two hundred more after that until the two Federation spies are turned over to us. This is the order of Kor."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,Did you hear them?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"Yes, of course, Captain. But nothing has changed."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"Well, Mister Spock. It seems it's up to you and me."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Spock,,"It would appear so, Captain."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,The Federation has invested a great deal of money in our training. They're about due for a small return. We have two hours with which to do it in.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Spock,,But only two. More Organians will die.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"No. No more will die on account of us, Mister Spock. Where are those phasers?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,I cannot tell you.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"You've told us a great deal about how you hate violence. Unless you tell me where those phasers are, you're going to have more violence than you know what to do with."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,You mean you would actually use force?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,It's entirely up to you.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Trefayne,,"Ayelborne, this is of no matter. Perhaps you'd better let him have what he wants. He"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"Very well, but it will do you no good. They're in that cabinet."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,,"Spock gets them, but leaves the tricorder.",
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"Gentlemen, I have no great love for you, your planet, your culture. Despite that, Mister Spock and I are going to go out there and quite probably die, in an attempt to show you that there are some things worth dying for."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,There are only two of you against an army. Don't you realise that what you intend to do will be hopeless?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Kirk,,"Come on, Mister Spock, let's get out of here."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,,"The doors open politely to let them leave, then close again behind them.",
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Claymare,,Brave men.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"Yes, but so foolish."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Trefayne,,"Interesting, however."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,"Of course, we cannot allow it. To stop them is very bad."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Claymare,,It is necessary. They may harm one another.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,Trefayne.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Trefayne,,They will wait until darkness.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,And then?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Trefayne,,Terrible. Inconceivable. Savage.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,We will wait.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,,"Outside, under cover of darkness and bushes.",
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, can we get those two guards? What would you say the odds on our getting out of here?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,Spock,,"Difficult to be precise, Captain. I should say approximately 7,824.7 to 1."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,Kirk,,"Difficult to be precise? 7,824 to 1?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,Spock,,"7,824.7 to 1."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,Kirk,,That's a pretty close approximation.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,Spock,,I endeavour to be accurate.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,Kirk,,"You do quite well. Set your phaser on stun. We're after the top dog, not the members of the pack."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,Spock,,Very good.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,Kirk,,"But if the situation calls for it, we kill, is that clear?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,Spock,,"Clear, Captain."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,Kirk,,I'll take the one on the left. Fire.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's headquarters,,"Two stunned Klingons fall, and Kirk and Spock run into the building.",
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Trefayne,,It has begun.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,Very well.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Claymare,,It will be hard.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,Ayelborne,,Prepare yourselves.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,council chamber,,They close their eyes and concentrate.,
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Klingon,,"No results, Commander."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Kor,,Nothing?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Klingon,,I cannot understand these people.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Kor,,"They know what death is, don't they?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Klingon,,They do not seem to be worried about anything.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Kor,,"Bad enough to be a military governor, but to govern a population of sheep! Very well, Lieutenant, round up two hundred more."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Klingon,,"Yes, sir."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Kor,going into his office,Fools! Will I have to kill them all?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,,"The Klingons march off, and Kirk jumps one of them from a side corridor, getting his belt around the Lieutenant's neck.",
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Kirk,,"If you don't tell me what I want to know, I'll kill you here and now. Is that clear?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Klingon,,Yes.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Kirk,,Is Kor's office down there?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Klingon,,Yes.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Kirk,,What about the hostages? Talk. Talk.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Klingon,,I am to gather two hundred more.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Kirk,,To be killed?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,,The Klingon nods.,
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Kirk,,Mister Spock.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,,Spock knocks the Klingon out with a neck pinch.,
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Kirk,,"Well, what are the odds now?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Spock,,"Less than seven thousand to one, Captain. It's remarkable we've got this far."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,corridor,Kirk,,"Less than seven thousand to one. Well, getting better. Getting better."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,"Just stay where you are, Commander."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,You have done well to get this far through my guards.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Spock,taking his weapon,I believe you'll find that several of them are no longer in perfect operating condition.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"So, you are here. You will be interested in knowing that a Federation fleet is on its way here at the moment. Our fleet is preparing to meet them."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,"Checkmate, Commander."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,Shall we wait and see the results before you kill me?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,I don't intend to kill you unless I have to.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"Sentimentality, mercy. The emotions of peace. Your weakness, Captain Kirk. The Klingon Empire shall win. Think of it, as we sit here, in space above us the destiny of the galaxy will be decided for the next ten thousand years. Can I offer you a drink? We can toast the victory of the Klingon fleet."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Spock,,You may be premature. There are many possibilities.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"Today we conquer. If some day we are defeated, well, war has its fortunes good and bad. Do you know why we are so strong? Because we are a unit. Each of us is part of the greater whole, always under surveillance. Even a commander like myself, always under surveillance, Captain. If you will note."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,"Cover, Spock! Back!"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,,"The Klingons burst it, then suddenly everyone drops their weapons. Everyone.",
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,Shoot! Shoot!
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,,"They try hand to hand, but are unable to touch each other without extreme pain. Up on the Enterprise, the crew suddenly leap out of their seats and away from their consoles.",
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,"What is it, Spock?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Spock,,"Inexplicable, Captain. Extreme heat. Not only the weapons but the bodies as well."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,,Ayelborne and Claymare come in.,
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Ayelborne,,"We are terribly sorry to be forced to interfere, gentlemen, but we cannot permit you to harm yourselves."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,What are you talking about?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Claymare,,We have put a stop to your violence.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,You are stopping this? You?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Claymare,,All instruments of violence on this planet now radiate a temperature of three hundred and fifty degrees. They are inoperative.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,My fleet!
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Ayelborne,,The same conditions exist on both the star-fleets. There will be no battle.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,Ridiculous!
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Ayelborne,,"I suggest you contact them. You too, Captain. Your ship is now within range of your communications device."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Sulu,,Captain.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Sulu,,I can't explain it. We were just closing in on the Klingon fleet when
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Sulu,,Every control on our ship became too hot to handle.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,,"Then it all goes dark, and he can touch the consoles again",
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Sulu,,Our power's gone. Our phaser banks are dead.

27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"My fleet, it's helpless."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,What have you done?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Ayelborne,,"As I stand here, I also stand upon the home planet of the Klingon Empire, and the home planet of your Federation, Captain. I'm going to put a stop to this insane war."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,You're what?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,You're talking nonsense.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Ayelborne,,It is being done.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,You can't just stop the fleet. What gives you the right?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,You can't interfere. What happens in space is not your business.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Ayelborne,,"Unless both sides agree to an immediate cessation of hostilities, all your armed forces, wherever they may be, will be immediately immobilised."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,"We have legitimate grievances against the Klingons. They've invaded our territory, killed our citizens. They're openly aggressive. They've boasted that they'll take over half the galaxy."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"Why not? We're the stronger! You've tried to hem us in, cut off vital supplies, strangle our trade! You've been asking for war!"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,You're the ones who issued the ultimatum to withdraw from the disputed areas!
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,They are not disputed! They're clearly ours. And now you step in with some kind of trick.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Ayelborne,,"It is no trick, Commander. We have simply put an end to your war. All your military forces, wherever they are, are now completely paralysed."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Claymare,,"We find interference in other people's affairs most disgusting, but you gentlemen have given us no choice."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,You should be the first to be on our side. Two hundred hostages killed.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Ayelborne,,"No one has been killed, Captain."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Claymare,,No one has died here in uncounted thousands of years.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,You are liars. You are meddling in things that are none of your business.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,"Even if you have some power that we don't understand, you have no right to dictate to our Federation"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,Or our Empire!
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,How to handle their interstellar relations! We have the right
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Ayelborne,,"To wage war, Captain? To kill millions of innocent people? To destroy life on a planetary scale? Is that what you're defending?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,"Well, no one wants war. But there are proper channels. People have a right to handle their own affairs. Eventually, we will have"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Ayelborne,,"Oh, eventually you will have peace, but only after millions of people have died. It is true that in the future, you and the Klingons will become fast friends. You will work together."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,Never!
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Claymare,,"Your emotions are most discordant. We do not wish to seem inhospitable, but gentlemen, you must leave."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Ayelborne,,"Yes, please leave us. The mere presence of beings like yourselves is intensely painful to us."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,"What do you mean, beings like yourselves?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Ayelborne,,"Millions of years ago, Captain, we were humanoid like yourselves, but we have developed beyond the need of physical bodies. That of us which you see is mere appearance for your sake."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"Captain, it's a trick. We can handle them. I have an army."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,,"Kirk holds him back as Ayelborne and Claymare transform into pulsating lights, too bright to look at. Then they disappear.",
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Spock,,Fascinating. Pure energy. Pure thought. Totally incorporeal. Not life as we know it at all.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,"But what about this planet? The fields, the buildings, this citadel?"
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Spock,,"Conventionalisations, I should say. Useless to the Organians. Created so that visitors such as ourselves, could have conventional points of reference."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,But is all of this possible?
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Spock,,We have seen it with our own eyes. I should say the Organians are as far above us on the evolutionary scale as we are above the amoeba.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kirk,,"Well, Commander, I guess that takes care of the war. Obviously, the Organians aren't going to let us fight."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,kor's office,Kor,,"A shame, Captain. It would have been glorious."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Spock,,You've been most restrained since we left Organia.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,I'm embarrassed. I was furious with the Organians for stopping a war I didn't want. We think of ourselves as the most powerful beings in the universe. It's unsettling to discover that we're wrong.
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, it took millions of years for the Organians to evolve into what they are. Even the gods did not spring into being overnight. You and I have no reason to be embarrassed. We did, after all, beat the odds."
27,1,Errand of Mercy,bridge,Kirk,,"Oh, no, no, no, Mister Spock, We didn't beat the odds. We didn't have a chance. The Organians raided the game."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,,Enterprise is at Red Alert as she orbits a muddy looking planet. Every so often the ship shakes.,

28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Kirk,,"Understood, Engineer. Mister Spock? We can't avoid these areas of turbulence."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Spock,,"I believe we'll have them plotted in a few more orbits, Captain."

28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Mccoy,,Some heart flutter. Better risk a few drops of cordrazine.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Kirk,,Tricky stuff. Are you sure you want to risk
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,,The hypo is administered and Sulu opens his eyes.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Mccoy,,"You were about to make a medical comment, Jim?"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Kirk,,"Who, me, Doctor?"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Scott,at the helm,We're guiding around most of the time ripples now.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Kirk,,Mister Spock?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Spock,,"All plotted but one, Captain. Coming up on it now. Seems to be fairly heavy displacement."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,,"And they hit it just as McCoy still has the hypo in his hand, and the jolt results in him injecting it into his own stomach.",
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Kirk,,Bones! Get back to your positions.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Spock,,"The hypo, Captain."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Kirk,,It was set for cordrazine.

28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Mccoy,screams,Killers! Assassins! I won't let you! I'll kill you first! I won't let you! You won't get me! Murderers! Killers!
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,,He dashes into the turbolift.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Kirk,,Security alert.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's log, supplemental entry. Two drops of cordrazine can save a man's life. A hundred times that amount has just accidentally been pumped into Doctor McCoy's body. In a strange, wild frenzy, he has fled the ship's Bridge. All connecting decks have been placed on alert. We have no way of knowing if the madness is permanent or temporary, or in what direction it will drive McCoy."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,transporter room,,"McCoy enters, knocks out the Chief very quickly and scientifically, then beams himself away.",
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Kirk,,"Continue alert, decks four through eleven. The medical department knows as little as we do. In dosages approaching this, there's some record of wild paranoia."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Spock,,"Confirmed by the library record tapes, Captain. Subjects failed to recognise acquaintances, became hysterically convinced that they were in mortal danger, and were seeking escape at any cost. Extremely dangerous to himself or to anyone else who might"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Galloway,,"Bridge, Security. Alert, alert!"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Kirk,,Bridge here. Go ahead.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,transporter room,Galloway,,"Security 054, sir. We just found the transport chief injured."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Chief,,"Captain, Doctor McCoy has beamed himself down to the planet."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Spock,,"And the transporter at that time, Captain, was focused on the centre of the time disturbance."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,bridge,Kirk,,"So whatever's down there, McCoy is in the heart of it. Set up a landing party. Let's go get him. Kirk out."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,,"The landing party is Kirk, Spock, Scott, Uhura and two security guards. Among remains of fluted columns and fragments of Greek-style buildings is an irregular dough-nut shaped object with lights in it.",
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Kirk,,These ruins extend to the horizon. Begin recording.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Uhura,,"Recording, sir."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Spock,,And of considerable age. On the order of ten thousand centuries old.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Kirk,,"Detail, fan out. What is this thing, Mister Spock? It seems to be pulsating with power of some kind. Analysis, please."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Spock,,"Unbelievable, Captain."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Kirk,,That's funny.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Spock,,This single object is the source of all the time displacement.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Kirk,,Explain.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Spock,,"I can't. For this to do what it does is impossible by any science I understand. It is operating even now. Putting out waves and waves of time displacement, which we picked up millions of miles away."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Uhura,,Landing party to Enterprise. No sign of Doctor McCoy. Search progressing.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,,And he pops up from behind a rock after she and her security guard have passed by.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Spock,,Incredible power. It can't be a machine as we understand mechanics.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Kirk,,Then what is it?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Guardian,The doughnut pulses bright in time with the words,"A question. Since before your sun burned hot in space and before your race was born, I have awaited a question."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Kirk,,What are you?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Guardian,,I am the Guardian of Forever.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Kirk,,Are you machine or being?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Guardian,,"I am both and neither. I am my own beginning, my own ending."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Spock,,I see no reason for answers to be couched in riddles.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Guardian,,I answer as simply as your level of understanding makes possible.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Spock,,"A time portal, Captain. A gateway to other times and dimensions, if I'm correct."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Guardian,,As correct as possible for you. Your science knowledge is obviously primitive.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Spock,,Really.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Kirk,,"Annoyed, Spock?"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Guardian,,"Behold. A gateway to your own past, if you wish."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,,"A camel train passing a pyramid, ancient Rome - images appear inside the doughnut.",

28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Spock,,"Relive the accident. This time be certain that the hypo accident is avoided. Look at the speed with which the centuries are passing, Captain. To step through on precisely the day we wish"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Kirk,,Guardian. Can you change the speed at which yesterday passes?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Guardian,,I was made to offer the past in this manner. I cannot change.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,,The US cavalry charges.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Kirk,,"Strangely compelling, isn't it? To step through there and lose oneself in another world."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Spock,,I am a fool. My tricorder is capable of recording even at this speed. I've missed taping centuries of living history which no man before has ever
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,,"But McCoy has woken up, and dashes towards the Guardian.",
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Scott,,Doctor McCoy!
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Kirk,,"Bones, no!"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,,McCoy leaps through the doughnut and the pictures stop. He's gone.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Kirk,,Where is he?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Guardian,,He has passed into what was.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Uhura,,"Captain, I've lost contact with the ship. I was talking to them. Suddenly, it went dead. No static, just nothing."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Scott,,"Nothing wrong with the communicator, sir."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Guardian,,"Your vessel, your beginning, all that you knew is gone."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Kirk,,McCoy has somehow changed history.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Scott,,You mean we're stranded down here?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Spock,,"With no past, no future."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Uhura,,"Captain, I'm frightened."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Kirk,,"Earth's not there. At least, not the Earth we know. We're totally alone."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Narrator,,"Captain's log, no stardate. For us, time does not exist. McCoy, back somewhere in the past, has effected a change in the course of time. All Earth history has been changed. There is no starship Enterprise. We have only one chance. We have asked the Guardian to show us Earth's history again. Spock and I will go back into time ourselves and attempt to set right what ever it was that McCoy changed."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Spock,,"I was recording images at the time McCoy left. A rather barbaric period in your American history. I believe I can approximate just when to jump. Perhaps within a month of the correct time. A week, if we're fortunate."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Kirk,,"Make sure we arrive before McCoy got there. It's vital we stop him before he does whatever it was that changed all history. Guardian, if we are successful"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Guardian,,Then you will be returned. It will be as though none of you had gone.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Uhura,,"Captain, it seems impossible. Even if you were able to find the right date"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Scott,,Then even finding McCoy would be a miracle.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Spock,,There is no alternative.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Kirk,,"Scotty, when you think you've waited long enough. Each of you will have to try it. Even if you fail, at least you'll be alive in some past world somewhere."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Scott,,Aye.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Spock,,"Seconds now, sir. Stand by."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Scott,,"Good luck, gentlemen."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Uhura,,"Happiness at least, sir."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,,First World War images.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,planet surface,Spock,,And now.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,,They leap through a wall with a poster for boxing at Madison Square Gardens. Welcome to the Depression.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Kirk,,I've seen old photographs of this period. An economic upheaval had occurred.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Spock,,"It was called Depression, circa 1930. Quite barbaric."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,,"Two women give then curious looks, and Spock hides his ears with his hands.",
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Kirk,,We seem to be costumed a little out of step with the time.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Spock,,"I'm afraid I'm going to be difficult to explain in any case, Captain."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Kirk,,"Well, Mister Spock, if we can't disguise you, we'll find some way of explaining you."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Spock,,That should prove interesting.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Kirk,,Let's get out of here.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,,They are nearly run down crossing the street.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Spock,,Fascinating.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Driver,,"Look out, will you? Why don't you watch where you're going?"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,,They head into an alley with washing hanging out on the fire escape.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Spock,,"Theft, Captain?"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Kirk,,"Well, we'll steal from the rich and give back to the poor later. I think I'm going to like this century. Simple, easier to manage. We're not going to have any difficulty explaining"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,,Then he sees the policeman.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Policeman,,Well?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Kirk,,You're a police officer. I recognise the traditional accoutrements.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Spock,,You were saying you'll have no trouble explaining it.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Kirk,,My friend is obviously Chinese. I see you've noticed the ears. They're actually easy to explain.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,,A crowd is gathering.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Spock,,Perhaps the unfortunate accident I had as a child.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Kirk,,"The unfortunate accident he had as a child. He caught his head in a mechanical rice picker. But fortunately, there was an American missionary living close by who was actually a skilled plastic surgeon in civilian life."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Policeman,,"All right, all right. Drop those bundles and put your hands on that wall there! Come on!"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Kirk,,"Oh, how careless of your wife to let you go out that way."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Policeman,,What? Where?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Spock,,"Oh, yes, it's quite untidy. Here, let me help you."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,,"And a quick neck pinch in front of witnesses, then they grab the clothes and run off. With whistles blowing, they duck down the alley beside the 21st Street Mission and down the stairs to the cellar.",
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Kirk,,"You were actually enjoying my predicament back there. At times, you seem quite human."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Spock,,"Captain, I hardly believe that insults are within your prerogative as my commanding officer."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Kirk,,Sorry.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,,They get changed into jeans and shirts.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Kirk,,Time we faced the unpleasant facts.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Spock,,"First, I believe we have about a week before McCoy arrives, but we can't be certain."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Kirk,,"Arrives where? Honolulu, Boise, San Diego? Why not Outer Mongolia, for that matter?"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Spock,,"There is a theory. There could be some logic to the belief that time is fluid, like a river, with currents, eddies, backwash."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Kirk,,"And the same currents that swept McCoy to a certain time and place might sweep us there, too."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Spock,,"Unless that is true, Captain, we have no hope. Frustrating. Locked in here is the place and moment of his arrival, even the images of what he did. If only I could tie this tricorder in with the ship's computers for just a few moments."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Kirk,,Couldn't you build some form of computer aid here?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Spock,,In this zinc-plated vacuum-tubed culture?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Kirk,,"Yes, well, it would pose an extremely complex problem in logic, Mister Spock. Excuse me. I sometimes expect too much of you."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,,The lights come on.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Edith,,Who's there?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,,Spock puts on a woolen hat that was conveniently amongst the clothes Kirk stole. A young woman wearing an apron comes down the stairs.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Kirk,,"Excuse us, miss. We didn't mean to trespass. It's cold outside."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Edith,,A lie is a poor way to say hello. It isn't that cold.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Kirk,,No. We were being chased by a policeman.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Edith,,Why?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Kirk,,These clothes. We stole them. We didn't have any money.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Edith,,"Well, I could do with some help around here. Doing dishes, sweeping, general cleaning."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Spock,,At what rate of payment? I need radio tubes and so forth. My hobby.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Edith,,Fifteen cents an hour for ten hours a day. What are your names?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Kirk,,Mine is Jim Kirk. His is Spock.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Edith,,I'm Edith Keeler. You can start by cleaning up down here.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Kirk,,"Excuse me, Miss. Where are we?"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Edith,,You're in the 21st Street Mission.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Kirk,,Do you run this place?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Edith,,"Indeed I do, Mister Kirk."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,,She leaves them.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Kirk,,"Radio tubes and so on. I approve of hobbies, Mister Spock."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,,"Kirk and Spock collect their bowls of soup and pieces of bread, and sit at one of the long tables.",
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Edith,,Good evening.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,,She steps up onto a small stage with a piano.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Man,,You'll be sorry.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Kirk,,Why?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Man,,You expect to eat for free or something? You got to listen to Goody Two-shoes.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Edith,,"Now, as I'm sure somebody out there has said, it's time to pay for the soup."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Man,,"Not that she's a bad-looking broad, but if she really wanted to help out a fella in need"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Kirk,,Shut up. Shut up. I want to hear what she has to say.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Spock,,"Yes, of course, Captain."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Edith,,"Now, let's start by getting one thing straight. I'm not a do-gooder. If you're a bum, if you can't break off of the booze or whatever it is that makes you a bad risk, then get out. Now I don't pretend to tell you how to find happiness and love when every day is just a struggle to survive, but I do insist that you do survive because the days and the years ahead are worth living for. One day soon man is going to be able to harness incredible energies, maybe even the atom. Energies that could ultimately hurl us to other worlds in some sort of spaceship. And the men that reach out into space will be able to find ways to feed the hungry millions of the world and to cure their diseases. They will be able to find a way to give each man hope and a common future, and those are the days worth living for. Our deserts will bloom. (She continues under the dialogue.)"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Kirk,,"Development of atomic power is years away, and space flight years after that."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Spock,,Speculation. Gifted insight.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Kirk,,"I find her most uncommon, Mister Spock."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Edith,,Prepare for tomorrow. Get ready. Don't give up.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,,"Later, when the bowls are being handed in, Edith calls after Kirk.",
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Edith,,Mister Kirk. You are uncommon workmen. That basement looks like it's been scrubbed and polished.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Kirk,,Then we can report back for other work?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Edith,,Yes. Seven o'clock in the morning. Do you have a flop for the night?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Kirk,,A what?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Edith,,"You really are new at this, aren't you? A flop is a place to sleep."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Kirk,,Oh.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Edith,,There's a vacant room at the place where I live for two dollars a week. If you want to I'll take you there.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Kirk,,Thank you.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Edith,,Good.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,,She goes to get her coat.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Kirk,,We have a flop.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Spock,,"We have a what, Captain?"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Kirk,,A place to sleep.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Spock,,One might have said so in the first place.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,,"It must be some days later, because Spock has already built a 50's horror movie contraption, complete with static electricity running between two vertical wires. Kirk enters with groceries and turns the whining thing off.",
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,"Captain, I must have some platinum. A small block would be sufficient, five or six pounds. By passing certain circuits through there to be used as a duodynetic field core..."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, I've brought you some assorted vegetables, baloney in a hard roll for myself, and I've spent the other nine tenths of our combined salaries for the last three days on filling this order for you. Mister Spock, this bag does not contain platinum, silver or gold, nor is it likely to in the near future."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,"Captain, you're asking me to work with equipment which hardly very far ahead of stone knives and bearskins."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,"McCoy'll be along in a few days, perhaps sooner. There's no guarantee that these currents in time will bring us together. This has to work."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,"Captain. Captain, in three weeks at this rate, possibly a month, I might reach the first mnemonic memory circuits."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,,There's a knock at the door.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,Your hat.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Edith,,"If you can leave immediately, I can get you five hours work at twenty two cents an hour. What? What on Earth is that?"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,"I am endeavouring, ma'am, to construct a mnemonic memory circuit using stone knives and bearskins."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,,"Kirk and Spock are sweeping the floor, with the chairs stacked on the tables, and two men repairing clocks.",
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Spock,,Captain. Tools for finely detailed work.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,,"Later, a combination padlock is being opened by someone with very sensitive ears.",
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,,Spock is stoking the boiler when Edith comes in to confront them.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Edith,,That toolbox was locked with a combination lock and you opened it like a real pro. Why did you do it?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Spock,,I needed the fine tools for my radio work. They'd have been returned in the morning.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Edith,,"I'm sorry, I can't"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Kirk,,"If Mister Spock says that he needs the tools and that they'll be returned tomorrow morning, you can bet your reputation on that, Miss Keeler."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Edith,,"On one condition. Walk me home? I still have a few questions I'd like to ask about you two. Oh, and don't give me that questions about little old us? look. You know as well as I do how out of place you two are around here."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Spock,,"Interesting. Where would you estimate we belong, Miss Keeler?"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Edith,,"You? At his side, as if you've always been there and always will. And you? You belong in another place. I don't know where or how. I'll figure it out eventually."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Spock,,I'll finish with the furnace.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,cellar,Edith,,"Captain. Even when he doesn't say it, he does."

28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Edith,,"And you don't want to talk about it? Why? Did you do something wrong? Are you afraid of something? Whatever it is, let me help."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Kirk,,"Let me help. A hundred years or so from now, I believe, a famous novelist will write a classic using that theme. He'll recommend those three words even over I love you."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Edith,,"Centuries from now? Who is he? Where does he come from er, where will he come from?"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Kirk,,Silly question. Want to hear a silly answer?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Edith,,Yes.

28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,I may have found our focal point in time.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,I think you may also find you have a connection burning someplace.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,"Yes. I'm overloading those lines. I believe we'll have our answer on this screen, Captain."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,Good.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,"And, Captain, you may find this a bit distressing."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,Let's see what you have.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,I've slowed down the recording we made from the time vortex.

28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,,Then the whole thing goes up in flames.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,How bad?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,Bad enough.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,The President and Edith Keeler.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,"It would seem unlikely, Jim. A few moments ago, I read a 1930 newspaper article."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,"We know her future. Within six years from now, she'll become very important. Nationally famous."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,"Or Captain, Edith Keeler will die this year. I saw her obituary. Some sort of traffic accident."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,You must be mistaken. They both can't be true.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,"Captain, Edith Keeler is the focal point in time we've been looking for, the point that both we and Doctor McCoy have been drawn to."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,"She has two possible futures then, and depending on whether she lives or dies, all of history will be changed. And McCoy"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,Is the random element.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,"In his condition, what does he do? Does he kill her?"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,Or perhaps he prevents her from being killed. We don't know which.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,Get this thing fixed. We must find out before McCoy arrives.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,"Captain, suppose we discover that in order to set things straight again, Edith Keeler must die?"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,,The man from the canteen steals a milk bottle from a doorstep when McCoy leaps in through Singers Book Store window and starts shouting.,

28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,boarding house,,Jim and Edith are climbing the stairs together.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,boarding house,Edith,,Why? What is so funny about man reaching for the moon?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,boarding house,Kirk,,How do you know?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,boarding house,Edith,,"I just know, that's all. I feel it. And more, I think that one day they'll take all the money they spend now on war and death"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,boarding house,Kirk,,And make them spend it on life?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,boarding house,Edith,,Yes. You see the same things that I do. We speak the same language.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,boarding house,Kirk,,The very same.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,boarding house,,They are outside room 33 when he leans in for the kiss.,

28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Man,,"Look, fella, you take a sip too much of that old wood alky, and, and almost anything seems like it"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Mccoy,,"Where? Where are we? Earth? The constellations seem right, but. Explain! Explain this trick."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Man,,"I, I,"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Mccoy,,"Biped. Small. Good cranial development. No doubt considerable human ancestry. Is that how you're able to fake all of this? Very good. Modern museum perfection. Right down to the cement beams. Very, very good. Oh, I'd give a lot to see the hospital. Probably needles and sutures. All the pain. They used to hand-cut and sew people like garments. Needles and sutures. Oh, the terrible pain!"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,,"He passes out on the ground and his colour starts to improve. The man frisks him, finds his phaser and runs off a little way. Then he fiddles with the phaser, and disintegrates himself.",

28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,I'll need at least two more days before I dare make another attempt.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,"McCoy could have been in the city a week now for all we know, and whatever he does that affects her and changes history could happen tonight or tomorrow morning."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,"Captain, our last bit of information was obtained at the expense of thirty hours work in fused and burned circuits."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,"I must know whether she lives or dies, Spock. I must know what to do."

28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Mccoy,,I can't. I got to keep moving. I can't let them find me.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,Edith,,There's a cot in the back room. They won't find you there. Come on.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,canteen,,She helps him out just as Spock comes in and starts serving the drinks,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,"This is how history went after McCoy changed it. Here, in the late 1930s. A growing pacifist movement whose influence delayed the United States' entry into the Second World War. While peace negotiations dragged on, Germany had time to complete its heavy-water experiments."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,Germany. Fascism. Hitler. They won the Second World War.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,"Because all this lets them develop the A-bomb first. There's no mistake, Captain. Let me run it again. Edith Keeler. Founder of the peace movement."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,But she was right. Peace was the way.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,"She was right, but at the wrong time. With the A-bomb, and with their V2 rockets to carry them, Germany captured the world."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,No.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,"And all this because McCoy came back and somehow kept her from dying in a street accident as she was meant to. We must stop him, Jim."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,How did she die? What day?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Spock,,"We can estimate general happenings from these images, but I can't trace down precise actions at exact moments, Captain. I'm sorry."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,room,Kirk,,"Spock, I believe I'm in love with Edith Keeler."

28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Mccoy,,"The most common question to ask would be, where am I? I don't think I'll ask it."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Edith,,Why not?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Mccoy,,The only possible answer would conclusively prove that I'm either unconscious or demented. This looks like old Earth around 1920 or 25.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Edith,,Would you care to try for 30?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Mccoy,,"I am unconscious, or demented."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Edith,,I have a friend that talks about Earth the same way that you do. Would you like to meet him?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Mccoy,,"I'm a surgeon, not a psychiatrist. I am Leonard McCoy, Senior Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Edith,,"I don't mean to disbelieve you, but that's hardly a Navy uniform."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Mccoy,,"It's quite all right. It's quite all right dear, because I don't believe in you, either."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Edith,,Get some rest.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,boarding house,,Edith has just gone up a flight of stairs.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,boarding house,Kirk,,Edith.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,boarding house,Edith,,"Are you following me, sir?"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,boarding house,Kirk,,With ulterior motives. Does that please you?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,boarding house,Edith,,"I hope it means (she stumbles on the step and Kirk catches her, while Spock watches.) Oh! How stupid! I've been up and down those stairs a thousand times. I could have broken my neck."

28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,boarding house,Kirk,,"No, of course you didn't."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,boarding house,Spock,,"I must point out that when she stumbled, she might have died right there, had you not caught her."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,boarding house,Kirk,,It's not yet time. McCoy isn't here.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,boarding house,Spock,,"We're not that sure of our facts. Who's to say when the exact time will come? Save her, do as your heart tells you to do, and millions will die who did not die before."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,,McCoy is out of bed.,
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Mccoy,,Come in.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Edith,,"Well, you look just fine, Doctor."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Mccoy,,Thank you.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Edith,,I thought you might like to see the evening paper.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Mccoy,,"No, not particularly. You know, I've convinced myself that this is all in a cordrazine hallucination, but I've decided you're not."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Edith,,That's reassuring.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Mccoy,,"But if you're not, what are you?"
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Edith,,"A friend. When you showed up here, you looked like you could use one."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Mccoy,,I don't doubt it. What about this place? Do you run it?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Edith,,I try to.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Mccoy,,Why?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Edith,,It's necessary.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Mccoy,,"Well, it was for me, at least. You may have saved my life."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Edith,,Lots of people drink from the wrong bottle sometimes.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Mccoy,,Not as wrong as the bottle I drank from. Allow me to show my gratitude. Perhaps there's something I can do around here to thank you.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Edith,,We can talk about that later. I have to go. My young man is taking me to a Clark Gable movie.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Mccoy,,A who movie?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Edith,,A Clark Gable. Don't you know?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Mccoy,,"Well, I know what a movie is, but."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,mission back room,Edith,,That's very strange. You get some rest. I'll see you later.
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,,"Edith, Kirk and Spock leave the Mission together, then Spock heads off alone. Kirk and Edith dodge traffic to cross the street.",
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Edith,,"If we hurry, maybe we can catch the Clark Gable movie at the Orpheum."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Kirk,,What?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Edith,,"You know, Doctor McCoy said the same thing."
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Kirk,,McCoy! Leonard McCoy?
28,1,The City on the Edge of Forever,street,Edith,,Yes. He's in the Mission. He's

29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,"Anything, Lieutenant?"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Uhura,,"No, sir. I've tried every major transmitting station on Deneva. None of them have acknowledged my contact signal."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,"Try GSK-783, sub-space frequency 3."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Uhura,,"But sir, that's a call sign for a private transmitter."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,"I'm very well aware of that, Lieutenant. Try it."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,"Evaluation, Mister Spock."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Spock,,"As I speculated, Captain, the overall pattern of mass insanity destroying civilisations follows an almost straight line through this section of the galaxy. Over here the Beta Portilin system the ancient civilisations. Archaeologists have given us information indicating that they were the beginning. Two hundred years ago, Levinius Five was swept by mass insanity, then Theta Cygni Twelve. The last was Ingraham B, two years ago."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,"And next in line, Deneva. Bones, what's your theory about the cause of all this?"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Mccoy,,There's no medical or scientific cause for what happened on those planets. Jim.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,"But it follows a definite pattern, a systematic progression from planet to planet."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, we're picking up a ship on our sensors, heading directly into the Denevan sun. He'll burn up."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,"Plot an interception course, Mister Sulu. Warp factor eight. Lieutenant Uhura, try to contact that ship."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, aye, sir."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Spock,,"The ship is a one-man vessel of Denevan configuration, Captain. He does not seem to be out of control. His course is straight for the sun."

29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Uhura,,"Making contact, Captain."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,"Denevan ship, this is the USS Enterprise. Can you reverse your course? Acknowledge."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Scott,,"Captain, we'll get too close to the sun."

29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Spock,,Outer hull temperature now four hundred and eighty degrees and rising.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Sulu,,"He's too close, Captain."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Spock,,So are we. Hull temperature one thousand degrees and rising. The sun's gravimetric pull increasing.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Pilot,,I did it. It's finally gone. I'm free. I'm

29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, sir."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Spock,,"All clear, Captain. Hull temperature falling, gravimetric pull approaching tolerance level."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,Very well. Reduce to sub-warp speed. Take us to Deneva.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, aye, sir."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,That Denevan ship headed deliberately into the sun. Why?
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Mccoy,,"There's one possibility. The mass insanity may have reached this planet, too."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, I'm having difficulty on that transmitter call to Deneva."

29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, they make regular trips from here carrying supplies to the asteroid belt for the miners and bringing cargo out. I've made the run a couple of times myself as an engineering advisor."

29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Uhura,,"Sorry, sir."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,"I'm not interested in your excuses, Lieutenant. Re-establish contact with that transmitter."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Uhura,,"I'm afraid that's impossible at the moment, Captain. They stopped broadcasting immediately. They do not acknowledge my contact signal."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,Keep trying to raise them.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Mccoy,,"Jim, did you know who that woman was?"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,Yes. You were right a while back. My brother Sam lives on Deneva. He's a research biologist. That woman sounded like his wife Aurelan.

29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,planet surface,Mccoy,,"There's something wrong, Jim. Their nervous systems. Unconscious like this, there should be just routine autonomic activity, but I'm getting a very high reading, as though even in their unconscious state, they're being violently stimulated."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,planet surface,,A woman's scream cuts the air.,
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,planet surface,Kirk,,Fan out. Follow me. Security.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,laboratory,,A woman is trying to cover the air vents. A man and a boy are lying on the floor.,

29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,laboratory,Kirk,bearhugging her,Aurelan.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,laboratory,Aurelan,,They're here! They're here!
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,laboratory,Kirk,,"Bones. (McCoy sedates her) Aurelan, you're safe now."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,laboratory,Mccoy,,"Is this your brother, Jim?"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,laboratory,Kirk,,Sam. It is my brother. Was my brother.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,laboratory,Mccoy,,"I'm sorry, Jim. The boy's unconscious, but he's still alive."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,laboratory,Kirk,,Peter?
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,laboratory,Mccoy,,I'd better get the boy and his mother back to the ship. I can't do much for them down here.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,laboratory,Kirk,,Get ready to beam up.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,laboratory,Mccoy,,McCoy to Enterprise. Prepare to beam up party of four.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,laboratory,Spock,,"Captain, I understand how you must"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,laboratory,Kirk,,"Yes. Yes, Mister Spock. You heard my sister-in-law say something about they being here. Your guess."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,laboratory,Spock,,"Notice the ventilator, Captain. Apparently they were trying to keep something outside from getting in. Obviously they were not entirely successful."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,laboratory,Kirk,,It doesn't make sense. There are no harmful life forms reported. Our sensors didn't pick up anything that didn't belong here.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,laboratory,Spock,,That is correct. I am at a loss to understand it.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,laboratory,Mccoy,,"Ready to beam up, Captain. I'd like you to be onboard when your sister-in-law regains consciousness."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,laboratory,Kirk,,"Take charge of the landing party, Mister Spock. I want some answers to all this."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Mccoy,,I won't be able to give you the exact cause until I get the plates back from the lab. They're both in extreme pain. I sedated them heavily. But your sister-in-law seems to have a high tolerance. The tranquilliser hasn't affected her much.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Kirk,,Can she talk?
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Mccoy,,Yes.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Kirk,,"Aurelan? Aurelan, it's Jim."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Aurelan,,"Jim? Sam, he's"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Kirk,,He's dead. But your son's still alive. You've got to help us.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Aurelan,,"You are here. It is you, Jim."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Kirk,,"Yes, I'm here. You have to tell us what happened, Aurelan, to you and the others."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Aurelan,,They came eight months ago.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Kirk,,Who?
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Aurelan,,Things. Horrible things! Visitors brought them in their vessel from a planet. Ingraham B.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Kirk,,What kind of things?
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Aurelan,,Not the ship's crew's fault. The things made them bring their ship here.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Kirk,,"Aurelan, it's important that you tell us. What kind of things?"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Aurelan,,Not their fault.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,,"She starts screaming and crying again, so McCoy gives her another shot.",
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Mccoy,,"When she answers questions, any questions, it's as if she's fighting to get the answers out. As though something is exerting pain to stop her."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Aurelan,,"They use it to control us. They're spreading, Jim. They need us to be their arms and legs. They're forcing us to build ships for them. Don't let them! Don't let them go any further!"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,,"One last scream and convulsion, then all her readings plummet to zero. KIRK: My brother's son",

29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,planet surface,Kirk,,Report.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,planet surface,Spock,,"The streets are extraordinarily quiet, Captain. We've seen no other Denevans, and the ones we stunned earlier were gone when we came out."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,planet surface,Kirk,,You've seen some kind of creature? Any alien form?
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,planet surface,Scott,,"None, sir. Just that noise we heard."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,planet surface,Spock,,A peculiar buzzing sound. We were about to investigate it.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,planet surface,Kirk,,"All right. Let's go find out what it is. Set your phasers on force three, to kill. We're looking for some kind of creature, and we already know it will kill."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,courtyard,,They go down some steps into a shady courtyard where the noise is coming from. There are gelatinous-looking creatures attached to the shady side of a lintel.,
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,courtyard,Kirk,,Spock!
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,courtyard,,One detaches and flies around them.,
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,courtyard,Kirk,,Form a ring. Fire!
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,courtyard,,"After a prolonged burst, one falls to the ground and the others fly off.",
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,courtyard,Spock,,"Incredible. Not only should it have been destroyed by our phasers, it does not even register on my tricorder."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,courtyard,Zahra,,"Captain, it doesn't even look real."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,courtyard,Spock,,"It is not life as we know or understand it. Yet t is obviously alive, it exists."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,courtyard,Kirk,,And it can bear up under full phaser power.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,courtyard,Spock,,"Captain, I suggest we risk taking it aboard."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,courtyard,Kirk,,It's too close in here. It may be a trap in here. Let's move out.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,courtyard,,"As they head up the stairs, the felled creature revives and lands on Spock's back. He falls back in pain.",
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,courtyard,Kirk,,"Spock! Spock! (He pulls it off) It's gone. Can you stand? Spock, are you all right?"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,courtyard,Narrator,,"Captain's log supplemental. Whatever the creatures are, they have apparently taken over all the inhabitants of Deneva. Meanwhile, ship's surgeon Doctor McCoy is examining a strange puncture wound left by one of the creatures on Mister Spock's back."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Nurse. That's the second time he's come out of it. Either he's fighting us, or something inside of him is fighting us."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Chapel,,"Doctor, the readings have never looked like that before, not even on Mister Spock."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Mccoy,,Let's prepare to close. Nurse!
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Chapel,,"Doctor, that's not all you're going to do?"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Mccoy,,Miss Chapel.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Chapel,,"Doctor, there is more of it in him, entwined all through his body."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Miss Chapel, if you cannot assist me as required, call another nurse in here. But do one or the other now."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,,"McCoy enters in his surgical scrubs, carrying a jar.",
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,How is he?
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Mccoy,,"To be very frank, Jim, I don't know that I can do anything for Spock or your nephew. (hold up the jar) They're pieces of some form of living tissue. I removed one from Spock's spinal cord, the other from your sister-in-law's body. They're both the same. The boy's too weak to touch. Besides, removal of the tissue wouldn't stop the pain anyhow as far as I can tell."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,Did you operate on Spock in time?
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Mccoy,,"No. I just removed these for examination. His body's full of these tentacles, entwining and growing all about his nervous system."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,My nephew?
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Mccoy,,"The same. Evidently, when the creature attacks, it leaves a stinger much like a bee or wasp, leaving one of these in the victim's body. It takes over the victim very rapidly, and the entwining is far, far too involved for conventional surgery to remove."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,Recommendations?
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Mccoy,,"I'm sorry, Jim. The lab, the science departments, we're all stumped."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Spock,,No! No! (he sits up)
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Chapel,,Mister Spock.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Spock,hoarsely,"No, I won't."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Chapel,,Mister Spock.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,,Spock leaves,
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Chapel,,"Bridge, this is Sickbay. Tell Doctor McCoy Mister Spock just left here."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Chapel,,He's delirious and possibly dangerous.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,"All decks, security alert. Locate and restrain Mister Spock. He may be dangerous. Use phasers on stun if necessary."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,,Spock enters the Bridge and throws Sulu out of his seat.,
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Spock,,I must take the ship.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,,Three of them wrestle him to the floor as Chapel enters and hands a hypo to McCoy.,
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Spock,,Down! I must take it down.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,,McCoy sedates him.,
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,Get him back to the Sickbay. Use security restraints.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Mccoy,,The K3 indicator registers the level of pain. Watch as I turn it on. That's what he's been going through. I've never seen anything like it. No wonder the poor devils go mad.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Spock,,Doctor McCoy. Captain.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Kirk,,Spock.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Spock,,"These restraints will no longer be necessary. Nor will your sedatives, Doctor. I'll be able to return to duty. I apologise for my weakness earlier when I tried to take control of the ship. I simply did not understand."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Narrator,,"What is there to understand, Mister Spock?"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Spock,,"I am a Vulcan, Doctor. Pain is a thing of the mind. The mind can be controlled."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Kirk,,You're only half-Vulcan. What about the human half of you?
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Spock,,"It is proving to be an inconvenience, but it is manageable. And the creature, with all of its thousands of parts, even now is pressuring me. (the pain indicator hits the top of the monitor) It wants this ship, but I am resisting."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Kirk,,"Can he control it the way he says, Bones?"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Who knows, Jim? I know the amount of pain the creature can inflict upon him, but whether he can control it hour to hour"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Spock,,"I have my own will, Captain. Let me help."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Kirk,,"I need you, Spock, but we can't take any chances. We'll keep you confined for a while longer. If you can maintain control, we'll see. My nephew. If he regains consciousness, will he go through that?"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Mccoy,,Yes.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Kirk,,Help them. I don't care what it takes or costs. You've got to help them.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Jim, aren't you forgetting something? There are over a million colonists on that planet down there, just as much your responsibility. They need your help, too."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,,They leave.,
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,Spock,,I am a Vulcan. I am a Vulcan. There is no pain.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,sickbay,,Then he breaks his restraints.,
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,Scott,,"Mister Spock, I thought you were still confined to Sickbay."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,Spock,,I was.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,Scott,,"Here, now. Where do you think you're going?"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,Spock,,I have an errand on the planet's surface. You will beam me down to the same co-ordinates as before.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,Scott,,"Not likely, Mister Spock."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,Spock,,"That is an order, Mister Scott."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,Scott,,"Aye, sir, and I'm sorry I have to disobey it. The Captain said no one was to transport down. Mister Spock."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,,Spock pushes Scott aside and neck-pinches his assistant. But Scott has a phaser in his hand when he gets up again.,
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,Scott,,"Freeze right there, Mister Spock, or I'll put you to sleep for sure. This is Mister Scott in the transporter room. Get me the Captain."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,,"Soon after, Kirk enters with an entourage, and the other man is rubbing his shoulder.",
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, I gave you an order to stay in the Sickbay."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,Spock,,"Until the pain was gone, Captain. It has been discontinued by me."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,Kirk,,Scotty?
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,Scott,,"He said he was transporting down to the surface, sir. Your orders were that no one was to beam down unless you authorised it. And knowing Mister Spock's determination on some things, I thought I'd better hold him here until I got your orders."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,Spock,,"One of the creatures will have to be captured and analysed, Captain. We did not have a clear opportunity to do so earlier when I was attacked. Since my nervous system is already affected, as you pointed out, Doctor, I don't believe they can do much more to me."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,Mccoy,,"Jim, this is ridiculous. I don't want my patients running around. He should be in bed."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,Spock,,"I am in complete control of myself, Doctor. The fact that I am here proves that I do not belong in bed."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, your logic, as usual, is inescapable. Beam him down. Stay in constant touch with us. Give him your phaser. He'll need that, too."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,Spock,,"Thank you, Captain."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,transporter room,Kirk,,Energise.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,corridor,Mccoy,,"Jim, that man is sick. Don't give me any damnable logic about him being the only man for the job."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,corridor,Kirk,,"I don't have to, Bones. We both know he is."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,planet surface,,"A man tries to attack Spock, but is neck-pinched. After struggling to regain his self-control, Spock returns to the courtyard of the gel-creatures. He phasers one off the lintel and puts it into a metal box.",
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,,Kirk and McCoy enter.,
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,Spock,,"Come in, gentlemen. I believe you'll find this interesting. (McCoy scans Spock.) Doctor, your medical skill and curiosity are quite admirable, but I assure you I'm all right."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,Mccoy,,"You may be controlling the pain, Mister Spock, but you're far from all right."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,Spock,,"Unimportant at the moment, Doctor. Please observe. Interesting, gentlemen. A one-celled creature resembling, more than anything else, a huge, individual brain cell."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,Kirk,,Yes. That would answer a lot of questions.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,Spock,,"Do you understand what I'm suggesting, Captain?"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,Kirk,,"I think so. This may be one cell in a larger organism. An incredibly huge organism, in fact."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,Spock,,"And although it is not physically connected to the other cells, it is nevertheless part of the whole creature, guided by the whole, drawing its strength from the whole, which probably accounts for its unusual resistance to our phaser weapons."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,Kirk,,"Existing so differently from any living matter or energy as we know it, that it may have come here, planet by planet, from an entirely different galaxy."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,Spock,,"From a place where our physical laws do not apply. We may therefore find it difficult to destroy, Captain."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,Kirk,,"But not impossible, Mister Spock. The Denevan that flew into the sun cried out that he was free, that he'd won. That's the angle to work on, gentlemen. I want an analysis of all this from Medical and Life Science departments within the hour."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,Spock,,"Yes, sir."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,,"Kirk leaves, then McCoy.",
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,,"Later, Chapel is working with McCoy when Kirk enters.",
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,Mccoy,,"I'm sorry, Captain. I've tried everything I can. Variant radiation, intense heat, even as great as nine thousand degrees."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,Kirk,,Then you're wasting your time. There has to be something that'll kill the creature without destroying the human host.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,Mccoy,,"Which happens to be my point. The thing won't die, even at temperatures and radiation which would burn Spock and your nephew to ashes."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,Kirk,,"I can't accept that, Bones. We've got fourteen science labs aboard this ship. The finest equipment and computers in the galaxy."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,Mccoy,,"Captain, I understand your concern. Your affection for Spock, the fact that your nephew is the last survivor of your brother's family."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,Kirk,,"No, no, Bones. There's more than two lives at stake here. I cannot let it spread beyond this colony, even if it means destroying a million people down there."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,science lab,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 3289.8. I am faced with the most difficult decision of my life. Unless we find a way to destroy the creatures without killing their human hosts, my command responsibilities will force me to kill over a million people."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,briefing room,Kirk,,Gentlemen.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,briefing room,Spock,,"I regret I see no other choice for you, Captain. We already know this thing has destroyed three civilisations. Perhaps more."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Gentlemen, I want it stopped, too, but not at the cost of destroying over a million people."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,briefing room,Spock,,"Including myself, Doctor, and Captain Kirk's young nephew. Understandably upsetting, but once it spreads past here, there are dozens of colonies beyond and billions of people."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,briefing room,Mccoy,,"If killing five people saves ten, it's a bargain. Is that your simple logic, Mister Spock?"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,briefing room,Kirk,,"I will accept neither of those alternatives, gentlemen. I cannot let this thing expand beyond this planet, nor do I intend to kill a million or more people to stop it. I want another answer. I'm putting you gentlemen on the hot seat with me. I want that third alternative."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Report.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"I'm sorry, Jim. We've been over and over it, made every conceivable test."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,kirk's quarters,Spock,,I therefore request permission to beam down to the planet's surface. I also suggest that your nephew accompany me.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Request denied.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"Captain, I do not make this request lightly. I do not know how much longer I can hold out against the pain. But I do know what the boy will go through should he regain consciousness."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Request denied. There must be another answer. Something in the sun killed that thing before the Denevan died. All right. All right. We've tried heat, radiation. What other qualities or properties does the sun have?"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"It exists physically. It occupies space. It has mass, therefore gravity. It converts matter to energy."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Jim, we've been through it and through it. Radiation, heat"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,But one other thing you haven't mentioned. It's bright. It radiates a blinding light if you're close enough.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,Nothing lethal about light.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Not to us. But down on the surface, the creatures stayed in the shadows for the most part. Suppose they weren't simply hiding. Suppose they're sensitive to light. Light, like in a sun, close up."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,kirk's quarters,Spock,,A possibility.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"You can't move Deneva closer to the sun, Jim."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"No, but you can move the equivalent of the sun to Deneva. Mister Spock?"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"Yes. In essence, it can be done. A string of satellites around the planet with burning tri-magnesite and trevium."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Well, I can rig a test cubicle in the bio-lab, put our specimen in it. But I don't"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Good. Let's get on it.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,,Chapel puts the creature's jar into a large chamber.,
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Kirk,,"Your figures are, of course, accurate."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Spock,,"Of course. The light of the sun at the proximity where the Denevan declared himself free was one million candles per square inch. If this works, the satellites we orbit will produce light of such intensity that even someone in a closed, darkened area will be affected by it."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Chapel,,"Ready, Doctor."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Mccoy,,Put on your masks.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,,They cover their eyes with goggles while the light is shone in the chamber.,
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Mccoy,,Completed.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,,They open the chamber. The thing is still.,
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Mccoy,,"It worked! We can do it. What's the matter, Jim? We can do it."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Kirk,,It worked in a lab. With the creature exposed to everything we can give it. But what about the people who are infected?
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Mccoy,,"Well, I don't know. Maybe trial"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Kirk,,"Maybe. There's no time for maybes, Bones. We need to know now."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Mccoy,,But I'd have to put a
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Kirk,,"Yes, we'd have to put someone who's infected under that light."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Mccoy,,Do you have any idea of the risk?
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Kirk,,"We have to duplicate the conditions on the planet, and Spock"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Spock,,"Captain, you'll need a host for the next step in the test to determine whether the creature can be driven from the body. I am the logical choice."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Mccoy,,Do you know what one million candlelight per square inch can do to your optic nerves?
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Kirk,,"There's no other way, Bones. We have to duplicate the brilliance that existed at the moment the Denevan declared himself freed."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Mccoy,,All right. I'll rig up a protective pair of goggles.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Spock,,"There'll be none on the planet's surface, Doctor."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Kirk,,I agree completely.
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Mccoy,,"Unfortunately, you're both right. It's the only thing we can do. All right, Mister Spock."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,,Spock enters the experimental chamber.,
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Mccoy,,Mister Spock's the best first officer in the fleet.

29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Spock,,"Interesting. Just as dogs are sensitive to certain sounds which humans cannot hear, these creatures evidently are sensitive to light which we cannot see."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bio-lab,Kirk,,Are you telling me that Spock need not have been blinded?

29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Spock,,"An hereditary trait, Captain. The brightness of the Vulcan sun has caused the development of an inner eyelid, which acts as a shield against high-intensity light. Totally instinctive, Doctor. We tend to ignore it, as you ignore your own appendix."
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock. Regaining eyesight would be an emotional experience for most. You, I presume, felt nothing?"
29,1,Operation: Annihilate!,bridge,Spock,,"Quite the contrary, Captain. I had a very strong reaction. My first sight was the face of Doctor McCoy bending over me."

30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Whatever this stuff is, it's getting thicker. Suppose that has anything to do with the interference?"
30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,Kirk,,"I don't know. There has to be some explanation for the fact that the ship's sensors can't register anything but us, while we're picking up readings of multiple life forms. Are they still there, Spock?"

30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,Kirk,,That's useful.

30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,Kirk,,"What about it, Spock? Does this structure have anything to do with communicator interference?"
30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,Spock,,"I would say not, Captain. There's no indication of anything that would cause such interference."
30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,Kirk,,And it doesn't pick up on our ship's sensors.
30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,Spock,,Nor do our sensors register the life forms inside.
30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,Kirk,,Could it be exerting a force field of some kind that cuts into our sensor scan.

30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"You like to think of yourselves as complex creatures, but you're flawed. One gains admittance to your minds through many levels. You have too many to keep track of yourselves. There are unguarded entrances to any human mind."

30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Korob,,"Captain, you've seen something of our science. Now tell us about yours."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,"You seem to be singing a different tune. I'd rather know more about yours. You call it magic, you call it science. It seems unrelated to both of them."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Korob,,"What would you name it, Captain?"
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,"I wouldn't attempt to name it, but you seem to do with your mind what we do with tools. You alter matter, move it about by telekinesis."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Korob,,"Yes, we can change the molecular structure"
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"Korob, you talk too much."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Mccoy,,You kept Scott and Sulu as catspaws to lure us down here. How'd you know we'd come?
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Korob,,"Oh, we didn't have to know. They knew."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,Enough of this! You will tell us what we want to know.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,It's too late for threats. You let me contact the ship. How long do you think it will it be before a search party arrives?
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Korob,,"Some time, Captain. Quite some time."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,,The model Enterprise is encased in a block of perspex.,
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Korob,,"There will be no search party, Captain Kirk. An impenetrable force field around your ship, Captain. It will not hinder orbit, but your people are prisoners within it."
30,2,Catspaw,bridge,Chekov,,"It's some kind of a force field, sir, but not like any other I've ever heard of before. It's not coming from anywhere. It's simply all around us."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"I would advise you to co-operate, Captain. Forcible extraction of the information we wish from you is not complicated, but it is extremely painful and it has a certain draining effect."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,We have nothing to discuss.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Korob,,Take them to their cell. (gives the phaser to Scott)
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"Wait. The doctor will stay. Your turn will be next, Captain. It makes little difference. Take them out of here."
30,2,Catspaw,bridge,Desalle,,"Wave length analysis, Mister Chekov?"
30,2,Catspaw,bridge,Chekov,,"It will not analyse, sir."
30,2,Catspaw,bridge,Desalle,,"All right, but it's there and it's real. If it's real, it can be affected. Engineering, stand by to divert all power systems to the outer hull. Prepare impulse engines for generation of maximum heat directed as ordered. Maybe we can't break it, but I'll bet you credits to navy beans we can put a dent in it."
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,,Kirk and Spock are shackled to the wall again.,
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Kirk,,How long has it been?
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Spock,,"Twenty two minutes, seventeen seconds."
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Kirk,,Thanks. I wonder what they're doing to Doc.
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Spock,,"I'm sure we'll find out shortly. Jim, all of these things that we've seen. To an Earthman like yourself, they must seem quite familiar."
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Kirk,,Familiar. Startling. Not rational.
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Spock,,"Precisely. I refer you to the psychological theory of the racial subconscious. The universal myths, symbols."
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Kirk,,"Ghosts, witches."
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Spock,,And dungeons and castles and black cats. They all belong to the twilight world of consciousness.
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Kirk,,They tried to tap our conscious mind.
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Spock,,And they missed. They reached basically only the subconscious. Korob seemed puzzled by your reaction to the environment he'd provided.
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Kirk,,"He expected me to react as though it were all normal. Well, he admitted that they weren't native to this planet."
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Spock,,And not to have a knowledge of our scientific methods is most unlikely for any life form we've met in this galaxy.
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Kirk,,"They refer to us as creatures, as though we were some species that they were unfamiliar with. If we're creatures, I wonder what they're really like."
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Spock,,Evidently something totally alien in all respects.
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Kirk,,"Agreed. Totally alien. And I don't like hostile strangers showing such an acute interest in our galaxy, our world, Spock. Not at all like friendly visitors. We're going to have to stop them, cold. But at the moment"
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Spock,,"I, too, am at a loss at this time to suggest a course of action."
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,,The door opens and McCoy enters with Scott and Sulu. He has been zombified. Sulu unchains Kirk.,
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Kirk,,"Oh, Bones. Doc."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Korob,,You forget what we were sent here for.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"I forget nothing. I'm not a puppet, Korob, like you."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Korob,,You're a traitor.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"You are a fool. We have nothing like this and I like it. To touch, to feel to understand the idea of luxury I like it. And I don't intend to leave it."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Korob,,We have a duty to the old ones.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,What do they know of sensations? This is a new world.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Korob,,You're cruel. You torture our specimens.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"And that, too, is a new sensation. I find it stimulating."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Korob,,You're wrong! You're discarding everything we live by.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"I live by my own decisions. You're a weak fool, Korob."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Korob,,I have the power.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"But you're afraid to use it. Don't threaten me. I can squash you and that would be an interesting sensation, yes. I find I like these new sensations. Don't try to push me."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,,The door opens and the group enters.,
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"Captain. It's time for our talk. Korob, leave us alone and take these men with you."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,,Korob picks up the communicator and Enterprise from the table.,
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Korob,,"This is not ended, Sylvia."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"But it may end soon, old man."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,,"He leaves, followed by McCoy, Scott and Sulu.",
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,"What now? You wave your magic wand and destroy my mind, too?"
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"There's no real damage to the mind, Captain, simply a drain of knowledge and will."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,You don't call that damage?
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,Why should I?
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,"You'd know if you had compassion. A woman should have compassion, but I forget you're not a woman."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"But you're mistaken, Captain. I am a woman now. I come from a world without sensation as you and I now know it. It excites me. I want more."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,You seem to need us. Why?
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"Because you have knowledge which I lack. but were our abilities put together. Tell me about power, Captain. How does it feel?"
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,,"As Korob watches from behind a screen, Kirk puts his hand on her shoulder. He strokes her neck and face.",
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,What about Korob?
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,He is a fool. I'll do without him. But you? Why do I find you different? Why would it be so difficult to dispose of you?
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,Why don't you simply probe my mind and get what you want?
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"No, not that, not for you. What I want is a joining. My mind to yours willingly. Think of the secrets you could learn. Think of the power that would be yours. Anything you can imagine, I can give you."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,You're very persuasive. What happens if I go along?
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,Then everything would be ours together. I've never conceived of the idea of togetherness before. It excites me. You excite me. Why?
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,For the same reasons you excite me. You're a very beautiful woman.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,,He kisses her.,
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,You find me beautiful? But I can be many women. (now she's blonde teen jail-bait) You like what you see. (a platinum blonde in a loose cat-suit) or do you prefer me as I was?
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,You have a knack for giving me difficult choices. (kisses her again) You have nothing like that where you come from?
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,Nothing.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,"Your people, when they come here"
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"They're like, like feathers in the wind without the transmuter."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,nuzzling her neck,Transmuter?
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,The source. You will learn. I will teach you later. Later.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,Then it's a device. You do use tools.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,It gives only form. You're teaching me substance.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,You haven't changed your mind? You won't return home?
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,My home is here with you. A billion worlds of sensation to pick and choose.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,,"Another kiss, then he lets her go and she realises ",
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"You are using me. You hold me in your arms and there is no fire in your mind. You're trying to deceive me! It's here, (the crystal) like words on a page. You are using me."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,And why not? You've been using me and my crew.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,,"Enter Sulu, Scott and McCoy.",
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"You will be swept away. You, your men, your ship, your worlds!"
30,2,Catspaw,bridge,Uhura,,I don't see any change.
30,2,Catspaw,bridge,Desalle,,"It's there, Lieutenant."
30,2,Catspaw,bridge,Chekov,,"It was that electrical field we set up, Mister DeSalle, that dent you wanted. It's not much, but it is a start."
30,2,Catspaw,bridge,Desalle,,"Keep it up, Mister Chekov. Channel the entire output of reactors one, two, and three into the relay stations. Whatever it is, it's starting to weaken."
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,,Korob rushes in and releases the prisoners.,
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Korob,,"I've released the model of your ship from the crystal, although they would have freed themselves soon. It's difficult to control so many things in so little time. (hands over phaser and communicator) Here. You must go before she finds the weapon is missing."
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Kirk,,I'm not leaving without my men.
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Korob,,"They're not your men anymore. They belong to Sylvia. I can no longer control them or her. She's irrational. The strain of adopting to your form, the insatiable desire for sensation and experience. She's a great danger and it was not necessary. We could have entered your galaxy in peace."
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Spock,,You came in a ship?
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Korob,,We used the transmuter.
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Kirk,,"Transmuter. Yes, she mentioned that."
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Korob,,There's no time to explain now. She means to destroy us all. There might still be a chance. Quickly. Come.
30,2,Catspaw,castle,,"They go cautiously along the corridors, and a cat's snarl is heard. There on a wall is the shadow of a very large feline.",
30,2,Catspaw,castle,Spock,,Fascinating.
30,2,Catspaw,castle,Kirk,,Why a cat?
30,2,Catspaw,castle,Spock,,"Racial memories. The cat is the most ruthless, most terrifying of animals, as far back as the sabre-toothed tiger."
30,2,Catspaw,castle,Korob,,I think I can stop her.
30,2,Catspaw,castle,Kirk,,You'd better let us. (draws the phaser) It's out of energy. She must have drained it. We could have jumped Scott and Sulu at any time. We didn't know. No way out.
30,2,Catspaw,castle,Korob,,It's my problem. She's one of my kind. Come quickly.
30,2,Catspaw,castle,,The giant cat pads down the corridor as they retreat back into the dungeon.,
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,,Spock goes to the hole in the ceiling that they originally fell through.,
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Kirk,,Do you think you can make it?
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Spock,,"Ready when you are, Captain."
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Kirk,to Korob,Get ready.
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,,Spock gets out into the corridor above.,
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Korob,,No! Get back. Get back. Get back! Get back!
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Kirk,,"Korob, that door won't last."
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Korob,,Get back!
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,,The door is pushed in and he is crushed underneath it. Kirk runs to his aid.,
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Korob,,"Go. Go! (He dies, and Kirk picks up his wand.)"
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Spock,,"Quickly, Captain."
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Kirk,,Korob seemed to think this was important. Said something about a transmuter.
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,,He throws the wand up to Spock.,
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,Spock,,"Captain, a bit more alacrity, if you please."
30,2,Catspaw,dungeon,,"Kirk uses a bed frame as a trampoline to help him reach the hole, and Spock pulls him the rest of the way.",
30,2,Catspaw,castle,Spock,,Captain.
30,2,Catspaw,castle,,McCoy arrives to take a swing at them with a morning-star. Kirk fights with him as Spock takes on Scott. Kirk knocks McCoy out.,
30,2,Catspaw,castle,Kirk,,Doc.
30,2,Catspaw,castle,,"Then Sulu arrives. Spock neck-pinches Scott. Kirk parries Sulu's martial arts attack until he can throw him against a door, when he is knocked out.",
30,2,Catspaw,castle,Spock,,Jim!
30,2,Catspaw,castle,,McCoy has awakened only to get knocked out again.,
30,2,Catspaw,castle,Kirk,,"Well, at least we found them."
30,2,Catspaw,castle,Spock,,"Fortuitous, Captain. And now that we have them all together? (the cat arrives) A most unpleasant situation, Captain. If only your phaser had some power."
30,2,Catspaw,castle,Kirk,,"Maybe we do. (he gets the wand) Sylvia, I have the transmuter. It's mine now."
30,2,Catspaw,castle,Sylvia,,"You're very clever, Captain. More so than I'd imagined. Clever, resourceful and handsome."
30,2,Catspaw,castle,Spock,,"Don't let her touch the wand, Captain."
30,2,Catspaw,castle,,"She strokes her pendant, and she and Kirk vanish.",
30,2,Catspaw,castle,Spock,,Jim!
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,Don't you get tired of these games?
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,I've never played games. Give it to me.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,"I wasn't sure before, but I am now. This is the source of your power, isn't it. The transmuter."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"No, not the source. It's merely an amplifier. The mind is the source. Mine is simple, but yours has the key but you don't know how to use it."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,I catch on quickly.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"It is not too late, Captain James Kirk. Come with me. I'll teach you. You'll teach me."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,Why? Because your people have nothing of your own? Is that why you need us?
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,"We need your dreams, your ambition. With them, I can build. Give me the transmuter."
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,No.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,,You fool. Don't you know what you're giving up? Everything that your species finds desirable. Look at me. I am a woman. I am all women.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Kirk,,I don't know what you are but you're not a woman. You've tortured my men and taken their minds from them. You ask for love and return pain instead.
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,Sylvia,holding a phaser,Korob was wrong. I didn't destroy all your weapons. Give me the transmuter. Give it to me!
30,2,Catspaw,drawing room,,"Kirk smashes the wand against the table, and there is a blinding blue light.",
30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,,"Kirk is standing on the rocks holding a phaser. Spock approaches wearing his tricorder. McCoy, Scott and Sulu follow him.",
30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,Mccoy,,"What happened, Jim?"
30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,Kirk,,"That'll take some explaining, Bones."
30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,Scott,,Everything's vanished.
30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,Kirk,,Not everything.
30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,,"By his feet are two tiny blue fluffy creatures with stick-thin arms and legs, and squid's tentacles for faces.",
30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,Kirk,,"Korob and Sylvia as they really are. Their forms were an illusion, just like the castle and everything else. Only the power pack gave them reality."
30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,Spock,,Fascinating. A life form totally alien to our galaxy. If we could preserve and study this
30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,,But the little puppets collapse and die. Smoke rises from the bodies.,
30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Too late. All of this, just an illusion."
30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,Kirk,,No illusion. Jackson is dead. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.
30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,Uhura,,"Standing by, Captain."
30,2,Catspaw,planet surface,Kirk,,Five to beam up.

31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,No change.
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Nancy,,Small thanks to the Starfleet.
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,"Now really, Commissioner, you can't blame the Starfleet."
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Nancy,,I should've received the proper inoculations ahead of time.
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,Sakuro's disease is extremely rare. The chances of anyone contracting it are literally billions to one.
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Nancy,,"I was sent to Epsilon Canaris Three to prevent a war, Doctor. Thanks to the inefficiency of the medical branch of the Starfleet, I've been forced to leave before my job was done."
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Kirk,,"Commissioner, I can assure you that once we reach the Enterprise, with its medical facilities, we'll have you back to your job in time for you to prevent that war."
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Nancy,,"How soon will we rendezvous with that ship of yours, Captain?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Kirk,,"In exactly four hours, twenty one minutes, Commissioner."
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Spock,,Captain.
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Kirk,,Yes?
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Will you check your automatic scanner, please?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Kirk,,That's odd. I've never seen anything like that before.

31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Helm does not answer, Captain."
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Kirk,,Neither do the pods. Communications are dead. Building overload. Cut all power relays.
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Cut, Captain."
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Nancy,,What's happening? I demand to know.
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Kirk,,"You already know as much as we do, Miss Hedford. Whatever that thing is outside, it's yanked us off course from the Enterprise."
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Now on course nine eight mark one two, heading directly toward Gamma Canaris region."
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,"Jim, we've got to get Miss Hedford to the Enterprise. Her condition."
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Kirk,,"I know, Bones, but there's nothing I can do about it."
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Nancy,,I insist you make your scheduled rendezvous with the Enterprise.
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Kirk,,"Miss Hedford, we'll do what we can, when we can. At the moment, we're helpless. You might as well sit back and enjoy the ride."
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,,The shuttlecraft has landed on a blue and purple planet. It is surrounded by lots of very high cliffs.,
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Kirk,,"Enterprise, this is the Galileo. Come in, please, come in. Enterprise, this is the Galileo. Come in, please. It's no good. We're not transmitting. Bones?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,"Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere. Some krypton, argon, neon. Temperature seventy five degrees Fahrenheit. Practically identical to Earth atmosphere."
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Kirk,,Spock?
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Gravity is similar to Earth. Most unusual in view of its size. The bulk of the body seems to be iron and nickel. More than an asteroid. Like a small planetoid, I should say. Possibly a remnant of a planet breakup. Totally suitable for human life."
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Kirk,,"All right, we get out and get up. Issue phasers. Bones, maintain full alert. Commissioner, you'll stay inside."
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Nancy,,"Just how long am I supposed to stay inside, Captain?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,shuttlecraft,Kirk,,That's a very good question. I wish I could answer it. All right. Let's go.

31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,,Spock checks the shuttlecraft for damage.,
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Spock,,"Most unusual. Unlikely. In fact, Captain, I would say quite impossible."
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Kirk,,Nothing wrong and nothing works.
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Spock,,Precisely.
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Kirk,,There must be a reason.
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Spock,,Obviously.
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Kirk,,Let's look a little further.
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,,Nancy comes out of the shuttlecraft.,
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Jim, I just took a tricording sweep, and I got the same readings almost as Spock got when we were pulled off course."
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Spock,,The ionised cloud.
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Mccoy,,"I think so, only it reads here on the surface with us. It's in that direction, and it doesn't read solid. It's more unstable, tenuous, like a collection of gases."
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Cochrane,,Hello! Hello!
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,,A figure in an orange jumpsuit waves and runs towards them.,
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Spock,,Fascinating.
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Kirk,,"Bones, get a physiological reading on that, whatever it is."
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Cochrane,,"Hello! Are you real? I mean, I'm not imagining you, am I?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Kirk,,We're real enough.
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Cochrane,,You speak English. Earth people?
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Kirk,,From the Federation.
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Cochrane,,"The F? Well, it doesn't matter. I'm Cochrane. I've been marooned here who knows how long. If you only knew how good it is to see you. And a woman. A beautiful one at that."
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Kirk,,"I'm Captain James T. Kirk, commanding the starship Enterprise. (they shake hands) This is my first officer Mister Spock."

31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Mccoy,,Pleasure.
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Kirk,,"Oh, and excuse me, Assistant Federation Commissioner Hedford."
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Cochrane,,"Ma'am. You're food to a starving man. All of you. Hey, that's a nice ship. Simple and clean. Been trying to get her to go again? Well, forget it. It won't work."
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Mccoy,,"He's human, Jim. Everything checks out perfectly."
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Kirk,,Mister Cochrane. We were forced off our course and taken here by some force we couldn't identify.
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Spock,,Which seems to be on the surface of this body at the moment.
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Cochrane,,"Well, I wouldn't know anything about that."
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Spock,,You say we'll be unable to get the ship to function again?
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Cochrane,,Not a chance. There's some sort of dampening field down here. Power systems don't work. Take my word for it.
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Spock,,You don't mind if we continue to try?
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Cochrane,,Go right ahead. You've got plenty of time.
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Kirk,,"What about you, Cochrane? How did you get here?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Cochrane,,"Marooned, I told you. Look, we'll have lots of time to learn about each other. I have a small place over that way. All the comforts of home. I can even offer you a hot bath."
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Nancy,,How perceptive of you to notice I needed one.
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Kirk,,"If you don't mind, Mister Cochrane, I'd like more than just a statement that you were marooned here. It's a long way off the beaten path."
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Cochrane,,"That's right. That's why I'm so glad to see you. Look, I'll tell you everything you want to know, but not here. Your ship is sure a beauty."
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Kirk,,"Yes, she is. And you've been out of circulation quite a while. The principles may be new to you. Mister Spock, why don't you explain our methods of propulsion to Mister Cochrane?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,,Spock and Cochrane go to the other side of the shuttlecraft.,
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Talks a lot, but he doesn't say much."
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Kirk,,I've noticed something else.
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Mccoy,,What's that?
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Kirk,,He looks familiar.
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Familiar? Now that you mention it, he does."
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Kirk,,"I can't quite place him, but. What about Miss Hedford?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Mccoy,,"No temperature yet, but we've got to get under way soon, Jim. I guarantee you, it will develop. What are we going to do?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,planet surface,Kirk,,Take Cochrane up on his offer.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,,"Not a true vertical in the building, and palms in the garden. It looks quite nice and avant-garde.",
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Spock,,"You built this, Mister Cochrane?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Cochrane,,Yes. I had tools and supplies left over from my crash.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Spock,,Not bad.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"Not Earth, but it's livable. I grow vegetables in the fields over that next ridge. Come on in."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"All the comforts of home indeed, Mister Cochrane. Where'd you get the antiques?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,You mean my instruments? I imagine things have changed a lot since I crashed.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,Not that much.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,,Hands a piece over to Spock to examine.,
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Nancy,,Must you keep it so terribly hot in here?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,The temperature's a constant seventy two degrees. Let me get you something cool to drink.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Mccoy,,Do you feel hot?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Nancy,,"I feel infuriated, deeply put upon, and absolutely outraged."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Mccoy,,It was quite a hike here. You're tired. Just take it easy for a while.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Nancy,,"I'll rest later, Doctor."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Mccoy,,"Temperature, Captain. First sign."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"Yes, I know. It means we're running out of time."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,"Captain, Doctor."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,,"From the doorway, the three see a swirly thing which then disappears. Cochrane comes in with a tray of drinks.",
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,What was that?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"Well, sometimes the light plays tricks on you. You'd be surprised what I've imagined I've seen around here sometimes."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,"We imagined nothing, Mister Cochrane. There was an entity out there and I suspect it was the same entity which brought us here. Please explain."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,There's nothing to explain.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,,He hands a drink to Nancy.,
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Nancy,,Thank you.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"You'll find I have a very low tolerance level where the safety of my people are concerned. We find you out here, where no human has any business being. We were virtually hijacked in space and brought here. Now I'm not just requesting an explanation, Mister. I'm demanding one."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,All right. It was the Companion.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,The what?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"That's what I call it. As a matter of fact, Captain, I didn't crash here. I was brought here in my disabled ship. I was almost dead. The Companion saved my life."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,You were injured?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"I was dying, Mister Spock."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,You seem perfectly all right now. What was the matter?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,I was an old man.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,You were what?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"Well, I don't know how it did it, but the Companion rejuvenated me, made me young again, like I am now."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,"I prefer to reserve judgment on that part of your story, sir. Meanwhile, would you please explain exactly what this Companion of yours is?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"I told you, I don't know what it is. It exists, it lives, and I can communicate with it."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Mccoy,,That's a pretty far out story.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"Mister Cochrane, do you have a first name?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,Zefram.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"Zefram Cochrane of Alpha Centuri, the discoverer of the space warp?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"That's right, Captain."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Mccoy,,But that's impossible. Zefram Cochrane died a hundred and fifty years ago.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,"The name of Zefram Cochrane is revered throughout the known galaxy. Planets were named after him. Great universities, cities."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"Isn't your story a little improbable, Mister Cochrane?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"No, it's true. I was eighty seven years old when I came here."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,You say this Companion found you and rejuvenated you? What were you doing in space at the age of eighty seven?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"I was tired, Captain. I was going to die, and I wanted to die in space. That's all."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,"True, his body was never found."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"You're looking at it, Mister Spock."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,"If so, you wear your age very well."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Mccoy,,How do you feel?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Nancy,,Terrible. How should I feel?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Mccoy,,You're running a little temperature. Perhaps you should lie down.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Nancy,,"Doctor, will you please just leave me alone. It's the heat."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Mccoy,,"All right. Try to relax. Jim, it's started, the fever. It's over a hundred, and it's climbing."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,How long do we have?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Mccoy,,"A matter of hours, that's all."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"Mister Cochrane, you say you were brought here a hundred and fifty years ago? You don't look over thirty five."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,I haven't aged. The Companion sees to that.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,"Captain. These instruments, they date from the time indicated. From your ship, Mister Cochrane?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"I cannibalised it. The food, water, gardens, everything else I need the Companion gives me. Apparently, it creates it out of the native elements."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,You say you can communicate with it. Perhaps you can find out what we're doing here.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,I already know.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,You wouldn't mind telling us?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,You won't like it.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,I already don't like it.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,You're here to keep me company.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,You mean you brought us here?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"No, the Companion did. I told it I'd die of loneliness. I thought it would release me. Instead, it brought you here."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Nancy,,"No! No! No! That's disgusting! We're not animals! No! Oh, no! It's inhuman! No! No!"
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,,Kirk and McCoy take her to a bed and lie her down. McCoy gives her an injection.,
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"Spock, run additional tricorder readings. Learn anything you can. Find me a weapon to use against this thing."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,You ask me to find a weapon. Do you intend to destroy it?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"I intend to do whatever's necessary to get us off this planet and Commissioner Hedford to the hospital. If the Companion stands in the way, then we push it out of the way. Clear, Spock?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,"Quite clear, Captain."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"Very well. You have your orders. (Spock leaves) Mister Cochrane, if you left here, what would happen to you?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"I'd begin to age again, normally."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,Do you want to leave here?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"Believe me, Captain, immortality consists largely of boredom. What's it like out there in the galaxy?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"We're on a thousand planets and spreading out. We cross fantastic distances and everything's alive, Cochrane. Life everywhere. We estimate there are millions of planets with intelligent life. We haven't begun to map them. Interesting?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,How would you like to sleep for a hundred and fifty years and wake up in a new world?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"It's all out there waiting for you, but we'll need your help to get away."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,You've got it.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside the shuttlecraft,,"Spock is working when the Companion appears next to him. He reaches to touch it, and then is flung away. The electrics in the shuttlecraft all burn out.",
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,You seem to think this Companion of yours can do almost anything.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,I said it was very powerful.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,Could it cure her?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,I don't know.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,How do you communicate with it?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"It's on a non-verbal level, but I usually get my message across."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,We've got to try. We're helpless. See if it can do something.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,How do you do it?
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Cochrane,,I just sort of clear my mind and it comes.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,,"He walks to the edge of the garden then stands with his eyes closed. The Companion appears, then moves to envelope him.",
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,"Bones, what do you make of that?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Mccoy,,"Almost a symbiosis of some kind, a sort of joining."
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,"Exactly what I think. Not exactly like a pet owner speaking to a beloved animal, would you say?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Mccoy,,"No, it's more than that."
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,Agreed. More like love.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,,"The Companion vanishes, so Kirk and McCoy go over to Cochrane.",
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Mccoy,,Are you all right?
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"Yes. It kind of drains me a little, but I'm all right."
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,Well?
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Cochrane,,The Companion can't do anything to help Miss Hedford.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,Then she'll die.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"If there's anything I could do to help, I would, and I will, but we can expect nothing from the Companion."
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside the shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,Spock! Are you all right?
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Yes. Quite all right, Doctor. A most fascinating thing happened. Apparently, the Companion imparted to me a rather quaint, old-fashioned electric shock of respectable voltage."
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside the shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,It attacked you?
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Evidently. Unquestionably, a large part of its substance is simple electricity."
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside the shuttlecraft,Mccoy,,"Oh, yes. I'm not a scientist or a physicist, Mister Spock, but am I correct in assuming that anything that generates electricity can be shorted out?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside the shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Quite correct, Doctor."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,,Spock is demonstrating the device he has put on the table.,
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,"Put this in the proximity of the Companion, throw this switch, and it will scramble every electrical impulse the creature can produce. It cannot fail."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"It troubles you, Cochrane?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,The Companion saved my life. It's taken care of me all these years. We've been very close in a way that's hard to explain. I suppose I even have an affection for it.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,It's also keeping you prisoner.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,I don't want it killed.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,We may simply render it powerless.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,But you don't know. You could kill it. I won't stand for that.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"We're getting out of here, Cochrane. Face up to it. I'll do anything I have to to save all of our lives."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"I suppose from your point of view, you're right."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Mccoy,,"We understand how you feel, Mister Cochrane, but it has to be done."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,All right. You want me to contact it?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,Please. Outside.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,What was it they used to call it? The Judas goat? (leaves)
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,"There is some risk, Captain. We do not know the extent of its powers."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,Nor it ours.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,,"Cochrane 'calls' and the Companion comes just as before. When it has enveloped him, Kirk gives the word.",
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,Now.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,,"The jolt knocks Cochrane out and the Companion comes towards the dwelling, apparently angry.",
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,,"It enters, blows up Spock's contraption then attacks Kirk and Spock. They are rolling around on the floor inside the sparkly thing, clutching their throats.",
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Mccoy,,"Stop it! You're killing them! Stop it, please! Stop it! You're choking them! Let them go. You're choking them! Stop it!"
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,,"Outside, Cochrane hears McCoy's shouts, and somehow calms the Companion. It vanishes.",
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Mccoy,,"You all right, Jim?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,Yeah.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Mccoy,,Spock?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,All right.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,,They go to the doorway and see the Companion with Cochrane again.,
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"Cochrane got it off of us, but I don't know whether he did us a favour or not."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Mccoy,,What kind of talk is that?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"How do you fight a thing like that? I've got a ship up there somewhere, responsibility for four lives here, one of them dying because of me."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Mccoy,,It isn't your fault.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"I'm in command, Bones. It makes it my fault. How do you fight a thing like that?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Mccoy,,Maybe you're a soldier so often that you forget you're also trained to be a diplomat. Why not try a carrot instead of a stick?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,Spock.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,"Yes, Captain?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"The universal translator on the shuttlecraft. We can try that, talk to that thing."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,The translator is for use with more congruent life forms.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"Adjust it, change it. The trouble with immortality is it's boring. Adjusting the translator will give you something to do."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,It is possible. If I could widen its pattern of reception
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"Right down your alley, Spock. Get it here and get to work. That thing is still out there. Better go that way."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,,"Spock leaves, passing Nancy's bed",
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,Any change?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Mccoy,,"Yes, for the worse."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Narrator,,"Ship's Log. Stardate 3219.8. Lieutenant Commander Scott recording in the absence of Captain Kirk. A shuttlecraft bearing the Captain, the first officer, Chief Surgeon McCoy, and Assistant Federation Commissioner Hedford is now definitely overdue for a rendezvous with the Enterprise. We are attempting to backtrack it."
31,2,Metamorphosis,bridge,Uhura,,Mister Scott. Computer central reports that we're coming up on the co-ordinates of the last established position of the shuttlecraft.
31,2,Metamorphosis,bridge,Scott,,"Thank you, Lieutenant."
31,2,Metamorphosis,bridge,Sulu,,"Steady. No, Mister Scott, bearing three ten mark thirty five just cleared. No antimatter residue."
31,2,Metamorphosis,bridge,Scott,,"All scanners, spherical sweep. Range, maximum. They'll have to pick it up."
31,2,Metamorphosis,bridge,Uhura,,"If the shuttlecraft powered away, Mister Scott, but if it were just towed?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,bridge,Scott,,"There'd still be traces of residual matter floating around, Lieutenant."
31,2,Metamorphosis,bridge,Sulu,,"Bearing two ten mark forty. Strong particle concentration. We're on it, Mister Scott."
31,2,Metamorphosis,bridge,Scott,,Lay on that course. Maintain scanning.
31,2,Metamorphosis,bridge,Sulu,,"Course laid in, sir. Particle density decreasing. Gone, sir. No readings."
31,2,Metamorphosis,bridge,Scott,,"Steady as she goes, Mister Sulu."
31,2,Metamorphosis,bridge,Uhura,,"What do you think it means, Mister Scott?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,bridge,Scott,,The shuttlecraft was on schedule until it was shy five hours of rendezvous. Then something happened.
31,2,Metamorphosis,bridge,Uhura,,"Well, I'd feel a lot better if it were a little more definite."
31,2,Metamorphosis,bridge,Scott,,"It didn't wreck. There was no debris. There's no trace of expelled internal atmosphere, no residual radioactivity. Ah, it's. Something took over. Tractor beams maybe. Something. They dragged it away on the heading we're now on."
31,2,Metamorphosis,bridge,Uhura,,"If there are no further traces, how are we going to follow them?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,bridge,Scott,,"We stay on this course, see what comes up."
31,2,Metamorphosis,bridge,Uhura,,"It's a big galaxy, Mister Scott."
31,2,Metamorphosis,bridge,Scott,,Aye.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,,"Spock is working on the Universal Translator. It is basically a metal tube nearly a foot long, that can be held in the hand.",
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,What's the theory behind this device?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"There are certain universal ideas and concepts common to all intelligent life. This device instantaneously compares the frequency of brainwave patterns, selects those ideas and concepts it recognises, and then provides the necessary grammar."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,Then it translates its findings into English.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,You mean it speaks?
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"With a voice or the approximation of whatever the creature is on the sending end. Not one hundred percent efficient, but nothing ever is. Ready, Mister Spock?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,"Quite ready, Captain."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,"Mister Cochrane, call the Companion."
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,,Cochrane summons the Companion.,
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,Companion. (It leaves Cochrane) We wish to talk to you.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Companion,,"How can we communicate? My thoughts, you are hearing them. This is interesting."
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,Feminine. No doubt about it.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Spock,,Yes. The matter of gender could change the entire situation.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,I'm way ahead of you.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Spock,,Then it is not a zookeeper.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,No. A lover. Companion. It is wrong to keep us here against our will.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Companion,,"A man needs the company of his own kind, or he will cease to exist. He felt it to me."
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,One of us will cease to exist if we don't get her to a place where we can care for her.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Companion,,The man needs others of his species. That is why you are here. The man must continue.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,"Companion, try to understand. It is the nature of our species to be free, just as it is your nature to stay here. We will cease to exist in captivity."
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Companion,,"Your bodies have stopped their peculiar degeneration. There will be nothing to harm you. You will continue, and the man will continue. This is necessary."
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Spock,,"This is a marvellous opportunity to add to our knowledge. Ask it about its nature, its history."
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,This isn't a classroom. I'm trying to get us out of here.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Spock,,A chance like this may never come again. It could tell us so much.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,"This isn't the time. Companion, what you offer us is not continuation. It is non=existence. We will cease to exist. Even the man will cease to exist."
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Companion,,"Your impulses are illogical. This communication is useless. The man must continue. Therefore, you will continue. It is necessary."
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,,"She vanishes, and they all head back indoors.",
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"Captain, why did you build that translator with a feminine voice?"
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,We didn't.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,But I heard

31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,"Her attitude when she approaches you is profoundly different than when she contacts us. Her appearance is soft, gentle. Her voice is melodic, pleasing. I do not totally understand the emotion, but it obviously exists. The Companion loves you."

31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Kirk,,What are you complaining about? It kept you alive.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,That thing fed on me. It used me. It's disgusting.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Mccoy,,"There's nothing disgusting about it. It's just another life form, that's all. You get used to those things."
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Cochrane,,You're as bad as it is.
31,2,Metamorphosis,cochrane's home,Spock,,"Your highly emotional reaction is most illogical. Your relationship with the Companion has for one hundred and fifty years been emotionally satisfying, eminently practical, and totally harmless. It may indeed have been quite beneficial."

31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,"He will not continue. He will cease to exist. By your feeling for him, you are condemning him to an existence he will find unbearable. He will cease to exist."
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Companion,,He does not age. He remains forever.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,"You speak of his body. I speak of his spirit. Companion, inside the shelter, a female of our species is dying. She will not continue. That is what will happen to the man unless you release all of us."

31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,"Our species can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome. You take away all obstacles. Without them to strengthen us, we will weaken and die. You regard the man only as a toy. You amuse yourself with him."

31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,"But you can't really love him. You haven't the slightest knowledge of love, the total union of two people. You are the Companion. He is the man. You are two different things. You can't join. You can't love. You may keep him here forever, but you will always be separate, apart from him."

31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,"Spock, check out the shuttlecraft. Engine, communications, everything."
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Nancy,,"That will not be necessary, Captain. Your vehicle will operate as before, so will the communications device."

31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Nancy,,"We could do nothing now to stop you. You said we would not know love because we were not human. Now we are human. We'll know the change of days. We will know death. But to touch the hand of man, nothing is as important."

31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Kirk,,"Interesting story, Scotty. I can't tell you now because, quite frankly, I don't know how it's going to end. Kirk out."

31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Cochrane,,I have honours enough.
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Spock,,"But you will age, both of you. There will be no immortality. You'll both grow old here and finally die."
31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"That's been happening to men and women for a long time. I've got the feeling it's one of the pleasanter things about being human, as long as you grow old together."

31,2,Metamorphosis,outside cochrane's home,Cochrane,,"There's plenty of water here. The climate's good for growing things. I might try to plant a fig tree. A man's entitled to that, isn't he? It isn't gratitude, Captain. Now that I see her, touch her, I know that I love her. We'll have a lot of years together. They'll be happy ones."

32,2,Friday's Child,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Agreed. Once they've got it into their heads we're showing force, you can forget them signing any mining treaty."
32,2,Friday's Child,briefing room,Kirk,,"Very well. Scotty, you're in command. Bear in mind that the Klingons have been sighted in this sector. While we're negotiating down there, we don't want the Enterprise to become an incident up here."

32,2,Friday's Child,tent,Kras,,Is the new leader of the Ten Tribes afraid? Let me kill him for you.
32,2,Friday's Child,tent,Kirk,,Or let the Klingon and me fight. It might amuse you.
32,2,Friday's Child,tent,Maab,,"Perhaps to be a teer is to see in new ways. I begin to like you, Earthman, and I saw fear in the Klingon's eye."

32,2,Friday's Child,bridge,Scott,,We were forced to leave Capella to aid a Federation vessel under attack by a Klingon vessel. We were unable to contact our landing party before we were forced to answer the distress signal. Our inability to reach the landing party is strange and I am concerned.

32,2,Friday's Child,tent,Spock,,"Our check-in signal is one hour, twelve minutes overdue. Since no reconnaissance party has appeared, and since Mister Scott is notably efficient in such matters"
32,2,Friday's Child,tent,Kirk,,I must assume that something's keeping them busy up there. The Klingon ship.
32,2,Friday's Child,tent,Spock,,That would seem a logical conclusion.

We've fled into the hills, yet we know the Capellans will eventually find us by scent alone, if necessary. And we've learned one thing more. The girl, Eleen, hates the unborn child she is carrying."
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,,"It is, of course, a place with plenty of rocks and cliff faces.",
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Kirk,,"Stay with her, Bones. Nice place to get trapped in."
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Spock,,"But a defensible entrance, Captain."
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Kirk,,"Yes, I see. Scout up the trail that way. See what we have in the way of an exit. I'll take a look around."
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Mccoy,,"Now listen, you may be a Capellan woman and the widow of a high teer, but I'm a doctor, and it's my tradition to care for the sick and injured. Now, let me see that arm."

32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Mccoy,,Just as I thought. It can come anytime now.
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Eleen,,How do you know?
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Mccoy,,"Because I'm a doctor, that's how I know."
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Eleen,,Even the women of our village cannot tell so much with a touch. Strange hand. Very soft.

32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Spock,,"The walls get higher and narrower, but there is a way out."
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Kirk,,"Good. If we could block off that entrance, hold them off, it'd give us more time. They'd have to go around these hills."
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Spock,,There is enough loose rock and shale.
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Kirk,,Do you think we could create a sonic disruption with two of our communicators?
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Spock,,Only a very slight chance it would work.
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Kirk,,"Well, if you don't think we can, maybe we shouldn't try."
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Spock,,"Captain, I didn't say that exactly."
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,,The Capellans are getting close to the canyon entrance.,
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Spock,,The sound beams should produce a sympathetic vibration on the weak area of that slide.
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,,"The party is led by Maab, who senses something is wrong but keeps coming forward until the rock face explodes. Kras hides but other Capellans are crushed by the falling boulders. When the dust starts to clear, Kras takes the Federation phasers from a wounded Capellan then kills him with his own knife. The remaining members of the posse move on.",
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Kirk,,Worried about the delivery?
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Mccoy,,"Capellans aren't human, Jim. They're humanoid. There's certain internal differences. I don't have equipment to handle an emergency."
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Kirk,,"Well, if you don't think you can handle it"
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Mccoy,,Forget it. I can do it. The last thing I want around is a ham-handed ship's captain.
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,,They continue their climb up the canyon. It is steep and Eleen is struggling. Kirk goes to help.,
32,2,Friday's Child,hillside,Eleen,,No! Only McCoy.

32,2,Friday's Child,bridge,Chekov,,"Nothing, sir. If it were destroyed, I'd pick up debris readings of some sort."
32,2,Friday's Child,bridge,Sulu,,"It couldn't have run away from us, sir. Not a freighter."
32,2,Friday's Child,bridge,Scott,,"Mister Chekov, pull the microtape on that distress call. I want it replayed."
32,2,Friday's Child,bridge,Voice,,Commanding. We are under heavy attack by Klingon vessels. Two convoy ships are already damaged. We must have help.
32,2,Friday's Child,bridge,Narrator,,"Enterprise, acknowledge. Please acknowledge."
32,2,Friday's Child,bridge,Scott,,"Did you hear it? They called us by name. Not a general distress signal, but one aimed right at us."
32,2,Friday's Child,bridge,Sulu,,Wouldn't they normally call for the nearest starship?
32,2,Friday's Child,bridge,Scott,,How would a freighter know we were ordered into this sector?
32,2,Friday's Child,bridge,Sulu,,A trap. We were diverted from the planet.
32,2,Friday's Child,bridge,Uhura,,Or it could be an authentic distress call.
32,2,Friday's Child,bridge,Scott,,We'll stay long enough to make certain. Continue search pattern.

32,2,Friday's Child,cave,Mccoy,,Just a minute. Let me get her on the rock. There you go.
32,2,Friday's Child,cave,,Kirk puts the tablet on a rock and hits it with his knife. It bursts into flame and the whole cave is illuminated. Eleen is in pain.,

33,2,Who Mourns For Adonais?,water's side,Apollo,,"No, not as you understand it. We're immortal, we gods. But the Earth changed. Your fathers changed. They turned away until we were only memories. A god cannot survive as a memory. We need love, admiration, worship, as you need food."

I knew you would come to the stars one day. Of all the gods, I knew and I waited, waited for you to come and sit by my side."

34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Kirk,,"No, nothing in particular. Why ?"
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Mccoy,,"Well, it's nothing I can pinpoint without an examination, but he's become increasingly restive. If he were not a Vulcan, I'd almost say nervous. And for another thing, he's avoiding food. I checked and he hasn't eaten at all in three days."
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Kirk,,That just sounds like Mister Spock in one of his contemplative phases.
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Mccoy,,Miss Chapel.
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Chapel,carrying a tray and sounding embarrassed,Doctor McCoy.
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Mccoy,,Captain.
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Chapel,,Captain.
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Mccoy,,What's this?
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Chapel,,Oh.
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Mccoy,,"Oh! Vulcan plomeek soup, and I'll bet you made it too. You never give up hoping, do you?"
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Chapel,,"Well, Mister Spock hasn't been eating, Doctor, and I, I just happened to notice."
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Mccoy,,"It's all right. Carry on, Miss Chapel."
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,,She turns and rings the bell on Spock's quarters. The door opens and she enters.,
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Kirk,,"Bones, I'm a busy man."
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Mccoy,,"Jim, when I suggested to Spock that it was time for his routine check-up, your logical, unemotional first officer turned to me and said, you will cease to pry into my personal matters, Doctor, or I shall certainly break your neck."
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Kirk,,Spock said that?
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Spock,,What is this?
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,,"The door to his quarters opens and Chapel rushes out with a scream, just before the soup bowl hits the opposite wall.",
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Spock,,"Poking and prying! If I want anything from you, I'll ask for it!"
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,,Everyone stops and stares as he come to his door.,
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Spock,,"Captain, I should like to request a leave of absence on my home planet. On our present course you can divert to Vulcan with a loss of but two point eight light days."
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Kirk,,"Spock, what the devil is this all about?"
34,2,[Corridor],corridor,Spock,,"I have made my request, Captain. All I require from you is that you answer it. Yes or no."
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Kirk,,"All right, Spock, let's have it."
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,It is undignified for a woman to play servant to a man who is not hers.
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Kirk,,I'm more interested in your request for shore leave. In all the years
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,"You have my request, Captain. Will you grant it or not?"
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Kirk,,"In all the years that I've known you, you've never asked for a leave of any sort. In fact, you've refused them. Why now?"
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,"Captain, surely I have enough leave time accumulated."
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Kirk,,"Agreed, but that isn't the question, is it? If there's a problem of some sort, illness in the family"
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,"No. Nothing of that nature, Captain."
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Kirk,,"Then since we're headed for Altair Six, and since the shore facilities there are excellent"
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,No! I must. I wish to take my leave on Vulcan.
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Kirk,,"Spock, I'm asking you. What's wrong?"
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,I need rest. I'm asking you to accept that answer.
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Kirk,,Bridge. Helm.
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Sulu,,"Yes, Captain?"
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Kirk,,Alter course to Vulcan. Increase speed to warp four.
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Sulu,,"Aye, sir."
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,"Thank you, Captain."
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Kirk,,I suppose most of us overlook the fact that even Vulcans aren't indestructible.
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,,He leaves.,
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,No. (looking at his shaking hand) We're not.
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 3372.7. On course, on schedule, bound for Altair Six via Vulcan. First Officer Spock seems to be under stress. He has requested and been granted shore leave. Ship surgeon McCoy has him under medical surveillance."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, something's coming in on the Starfleet channel. Priority and urgent, sir."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Kirk,,"Put it on audio over here, Lieutenant."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Uhura,,"Message complete, sir. Switching over."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Starfleet,,"To Captain, USS Enterprise from Starfleet Sector Nine. Inauguration ceremonies, Altair Six, have been advanced seven solar days. You are ordered to alter your flight plan to accommodate, by order of Komack, Admiral, Starfleet Command. Acknowledge."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant Uhura, acknowledge that message."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, aye, sir."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov, compute course and speed necessary for compliance."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Chekov,a bit of a Russian accent,"We'll have to head directly there at warp six, sir. Insufficient time to stop off at Vulcan."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Kirk,,"Head directly for Altair Six. Sailor's luck, Mister Spock. Or, as one of Finagle's Laws puts it, 'Any home port the ship makes will be somebody else's, not mine'. The new president of Altair Six wants to get himself launched a week early, so we have to be there a week early. Don't worry. I'll see that you get your leave as soon as we're finished."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Spock,,"I quite understand, Captain."
34,2,[Corridor],kirk's quarters,,Kirk is resting in the dark when he has an idea.,
34,2,[Corridor],kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Bridge. Navigation.
34,2,[Corridor],kirk's quarters,Chekov,,Navigation. Chekov here.
34,2,[Corridor],kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov, how late will we arrive for the ceremonies if we increase speed to maximum and divert to Vulcan just long enough to drop off Mister Spock?"
34,2,[Corridor],kirk's quarters,Chekov,,"I don't understand, Captain."
34,2,[Corridor],kirk's quarters,Kirk,,How far behind schedule will diverting to Vulcan put us?
34,2,[Corridor],kirk's quarters,Chekov,,"We're on course for Vulcan, Captain, as Mister Spock ordered."
34,2,[Corridor],kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Thank you, Mister Chekov. Kirk, out."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock. Come with me, please."
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Kirk,,"Deck five. You've changed course for Vulcan, Mister Spock. Why?"
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Spock,,Changed the course?
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Kirk,,Do you deny it?
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Spock,,"No. No, by no means, Captain. It is quite possible."
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Kirk,,Then why'd you do it?
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Spock,,"Captain, I accept on your word that I did it, but I do not know why, nor do I remember doing it. Captain, lock me away. I do not wish to be seen. I cannot. No Vulcan could explain further."
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Kirk,,"I'm trying to help you, Spock."
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Spock,,Ask me no further questions. I will not answer.
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Kirk,,I order you to report to the Sickbay.
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Spock,,Sickbay?
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Kirk,,Complete examination. McCoy's waiting.
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,,Spock wanders in like a man in a dream.,
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Mccoy,,"Come in, Spock. I'm all ready for you."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Spock,,"My orders were to report to Sickbay, Doctor. I have done so. And now I'll go to my quarters."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Mccoy,,"My orders were to give you a thorough physical. In case you hadn't noticed, I have to answer to the same commanding officer that you do. Come on, Spock. Yield to the logic of the situation."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Spock,,"Examine me, for all the good it'll do either of us."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Sulu,,"How do you figure it, Chekov? First we're going to Vulcan, then we're going to Altair, then we're headed to Vulcan again, and now we're headed back to Altair."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Chekov,,I think I'm going to get space sick.
34,2,[Corridor],kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Jim, you've got to get Spock to Vulcan."
34,2,[Corridor],kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Bones, I will, I will. As soon as this mission is"
34,2,[Corridor],kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"No! Now. Right away. If you don't get him to Vulcan within a week eight days at the outside, he'll die. He'll die, Jim."
34,2,[Corridor],kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Why must he die? Why within eight days? Explain.
34,2,[Corridor],kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,I don't know.
34,2,[Corridor],kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"You keep saying that. Are you a doctor, or aren't you?"
34,2,[Corridor],kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"There's a growing imbalance of body functions, as if in our bodies huge amounts of adrenalin were constantly being pumped into our bloodstreams. Now, I can't trace it down in my biocomps. Spock won't tell me what it is. But if it isn't stopped somehow, the physical and emotional pressures will simply kill him."
34,2,[Corridor],kirk's quarters,Kirk,,You say you're convinced he knows what it is?
34,2,[Corridor],kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"He does, and he's as tightlipped about it as an Aldebaran Shellmouth. No use to ask him, Jim. He won't talk."
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,,"Spock is staring at the picture of a young girl on his monitor, but switches it off when the doorbell buzzes.",
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,Come.
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Kirk,,"Stay. McCoy has given me his medical evaluation of your condition. He says you're going to die unless something is done. What? Is it something only your planet can do for you? Spock! You've been called the best first officer in the fleet. That's an enormous asset to me. If I have to lose that first officer, I want to know why."
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,"It is a thing no out-worlder may know except those very few who have been involved. A Vulcan understands, but even we do not speak of it among ourselves. It is a deeply personal thing. Can you see that, Captain, and understand?"
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Kirk,,"No, I do not understand. Explain. Consider that an order."
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,"Captain, there are some things which transcend even the discipline of the service."
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Kirk,,Would it help if I told you that I'll treat this as totally confidential?
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,It has to do with biology.
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Kirk,,What?
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,Biology.
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Kirk,,What kind of biology?
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,Vulcan biology.
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Kirk,,"You mean the biology of Vulcans? Biology as in reproduction? Well, there's no need to be embarrassed about it, Mister Spock. It happens to the birds and the bees."
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,"The birds and the bees are not Vulcans, Captain. If they were, if any creature as proudly logical as us were to have their logic ripped from them as this time does to us. How do Vulcans choose their mates? Haven't you wondered?"
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Kirk,,I guess the rest of us assume that it's done quite logically.
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,"No. No. It is not. We shield it with ritual and customs shrouded in antiquity. You humans have no conception. It strips our minds from us. It brings a madness which rips away our veneer of civilisation. It is the pon farr. The time of mating. There are precedents in nature, Captain. The giant eelbirds of Regulus Five, once each eleven years they must return to the caverns where they hatched. On your Earth, the salmon. They must return to that one stream where they were born, to spawn or die in trying."
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Kirk,,"But you're not a fish, Mister Spock. You're"
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,"No. Nor am I a man. I'm a Vulcan. I'd hoped I would be spared this, but the ancient drives are too strong. Eventually, they catch up with us, and we are driven by forces we cannot control to return home and take a wife. Or die."
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Kirk,,"I haven't heard a word you've said, and I'll get you to Vulcan somehow."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant, get me Admiral Komack at Starfleet Command, Sector Nine. Pipe it down to McCoy's office."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Uhura,,"Starfleet Command. Yes, sir."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Chekov,,"Mister Sulu, you don't think"
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Sulu,,"Maybe you ought to plot a course back for Vulcan, just in case."
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,,Spock is playing his lyre when the intercom whistles.,
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Uhura,,Communication to Mister Spock. Lieutenant Uhura here. The captain asked me to
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,Let me alone. Let me alone!
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,,He pounds his desk monitor into a pulp.,
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Komack,,"Captain, you're making a most unusual request."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Kirk,,"I'm aware of that, sir, but it's of the utmost importance. You must give me permission to divert to Vulcan."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Komack,,But you refuse to explain why it is so important.
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Kirk,,"I can't, sir, but believe me, I wouldn't make such a request"
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Komack,,Altair Six is no ordinary matter. That area is just putting itself together after a long interplanetary conflict. This inauguration will stabilise the entire Altair system. Our appearance there is a demonstration of friendship and strength which will cause ripples clear to the Klingon Empire.
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Kirk,,"Sir, the delay would be, at most, a day. I can hardly believe that"
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Komack,,You will proceed to Altair Six as ordered. You have your orders. Starfleet out.
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well, that's that."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Kirk,,"No, it's not. I know the Altair situation. We would be one of three starships. Very impressive, very diplomatic, but it's simply not that vital."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Mccoy,,You can't go off to Vulcan against Starfleet orders. You'll be busted
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Kirk,,"I can't let Spock die, can I, Bones? And he will if we go to Altair. I owe him my life a dozen times over. Isn't that worth a career? He's my friend. Bridge. Navigation."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Chekov,,Bridge. Navigation.
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Vulcan. Tell Engineering I want warp eight or better. Push her for all she'll take."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,,"Nurse Chapel leaves Sickbay, beaming.",
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Chekov,,"Course already plotted. Laying it in, sir."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Kirk,,"I see. Very well. Carry on, Mister Chekov. Kirk, out."
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,,"Spock is lying on his bed, apparently asleep. Christine thinks about touching him and then goes to leave.",
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,Miss Chapel.
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Chapel,,"Yes, Mister Spock?"
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,"I had a most startling dream. You were trying to tell me something, but I couldn't hear you. It would be illogical for us to protest against our natures. Don't you think?"
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Chapel,,I don't understand.
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,Your face is wet.
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Chapel,,I came to tell you that we are bound for Vulcan. We'll be there in just a few days.
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,Vulcan. Miss Chapel.
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Chapel,,My name is Christine.
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Spock,,"Yes, I know, Christine. Would you make me some of that plomeek soup?"
34,2,[Corridor],spock's quarters,Chapel,,"Oh, I'd be very glad to do that, Mister Spock."
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Kirk,,Bridge.
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Spock,,"It is obvious that you have surmised my problem, Doctor. My compliments on your insight. Captain, there is a thing that happens to Vulcans at this time. Almost an insanity, which you would no doubt find distasteful."
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Kirk,,Will I? You've been most patient with my kinds of madness.
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Spock,,Then would you beam down to the planet's surface and stand with me? There is a brief ceremony.
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Kirk,,Is it permitted?
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Spock,,"It is my right. By tradition, the male is accompanied by his closest friends."
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Kirk,,"Thank you, Mister Spock."
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Spock,,I also request McCoy accompany me.
34,2,[Corridor],turbolift,Mccoy,,"I shall be honoured, sir."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Uhura,,"Captain. We're standing by on Vulcan hailing frequencies, sir."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Kirk,,"Open the channel, Lieutenant. Vulcan Space Central, this is the USS Enterprise requesting permission to assume standard orbit."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Vulcan,,"USS Enterprise from Vulcan Space Central. Permission granted. And from all of Vulcan, welcome. Is Commander Spock with you?"
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Spock,,This is Spock.
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Vulcan,,"Standby to activate your central viewer, please."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,,Nurse Chapel enters.,
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Chapel,,"Doctor, what's going on?"
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,,The viewscreen lights up with the image of a very beautiful woman.,
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,T'Pring,,"Spock, it is I."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Spock,,"T'Pring, parted from me and never parted, never and always touching and touched. We meet at the appointed place."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,T'Pring,,"Spock, parted from me and never parted, never and always touching and touched. I await you."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Uhura,,"She's lovely, Mister Spock. Who is she?"
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Spock,,She is T'Pring. My wife.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,,"The trio have beamed down onto a very red planet. Sky, ground, all shades of hot orange-red. Spock leads them into an area marked out by stone structures.",
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Spock,,"This is the land of my family. It has been held by us for more than two thousand Earth years. This is our place of Koon-ut-kal-if-fee,"
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,He called it Koon-ut what?
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,"He described it to me as meaning marriage or challenge. In the distant past, Vulcans killed to win their mates."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,And they still go mad at this time. Perhaps the price they pay for having no emotions the rest of the time.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,It's lovely. I wish the breeze were cooler.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,Yeah. Hot as Vulcan. Now I understand what that phrase means.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,The atmosphere is thinner than Earth.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,,Spock strikes a gong.,
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,I wonder when his T'Pring arrives.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Spock,,The marriage party approaches. I hear them.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,Marriage party? You said T'Pring was your wife.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Spock,,"By our parents' arrangement. A ceremony while we were but seven years of age. Less than a marriage but more than a betrothal. One touches the other in order to feel each other's thoughts. In this way our minds were locked together, so that at the proper time, we would both be drawn to Koon-ut-kal-if-fee."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,,"A jingling sound gets louder, and Spock strikes the gong again. Two men enter shaking contraptions with lots of bells, followed by a woman carried on a chair. T'Pring and others come behind her.",
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,"Bones, you know who that is? T'Pau. The only person to ever turn down a seat on the Federation Council."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,T'Pau. Officiating at Spock's wedding?
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,He never mentioned that his family was this important.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,,"T'Pau's chair is placed on a dais, and Spock greets her. She gives him a quick mind-meld.",
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,"Spock, are our ceremonies for outworlders?"
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Spock,,They are not outworlders. They are my friends. I am permitted this.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,,She gestures for them to approach.,
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Spock,,This is Kirk.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,Ma'am.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,And thee are called?
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,"Leonard McCoy, ma'am."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,Thee names these out worlders friends. How does thee pledge their behaviour?
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Spock,,"With my life, T'Pau."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,"What they are about to see comes down from the time of the beginning, without change. This is the Vulcan heart. This is the Vulcan soul. This is our way. Kah-if-farr."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,,"Spock is about to strike the gong again, when T'Pring intervenes.",
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pring,,Kal-if-fee!
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,What is it? What happened?
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,She chooses the challenge.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,pointing at T'Pau's bodyguard,With him?
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,He acts only if cowardice is seen. She will choose her champion.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,Spock?
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,"Do not attempt to speak with him, Kirk. He is deep in the plak-tow, the blood fever. He will not speak with thee again until he has passed through what is to come. If thee wishes to depart, thee may leave now."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,We'll stay.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,Spock chose his friends well.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,"Ma'am, I don't understand. Are you trying to say that she rejected him? That she doesn't want him?"
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,"He will have to fight for her. It is her right. T'Pring, thee has chosen the kal-if-fee, the challenge. Thee are prepared to become the property of the victor?"
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pring,,I am prepared.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,"Spock, does thee accept the challenge according to our laws and customs?"
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,,A single nod. T'Pring looks at the young man who followed her in.,
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,Think Spock can take him?
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,I doubt it. Not in his present condition.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,"T'Pring, thee will choose thy champion."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pring,,"As it was in the dawn of our days, as it is today, as it will be for all tomorrows, I make my choice. This one."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,,She steps past the expectant Stonn and points at Kirk.,
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Stonn,,No! I am to be the one. It was agreed.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,Be silent.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Stonn,,Hear me. I have made the ancient claim. I claim the right. The woman is
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,Kroykah!
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Stonn,,I ask forgiveness.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,"Kirk? T'Pring is within her rights, but our laws and customs are not binding on thee. Thee are free to decline with no harm on thyself."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Spock,,T'Pau.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,Thee speaks?
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Spock,,My friend does not understand.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,"The choice has been made, Spock. It is up to him now."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Spock,,"He does not know. I will do what I must, T'Pau, but not with him! His blood does not burn. He is my friend!"
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,It is said thy Vulcan blood is thin. Are thee Vulcan or are thee human?
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Spock,,"I burn, T'Pau. My eyes are flame. My heart is flame. Thee has the power, T'Pau. In the name of my fathers, forbid. Forbid! T'Pau. I plead with thee! I beg!"
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,Thee has prided thyself on thy Vulcan heritage. It is decided.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,What happens to Spock if I decline?
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,"Another champion will be selected. Do not interfere, Kirk. Keep thy place."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,"You can't do it, Jim."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,I can't?
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,No. She said their laws and customs were not binding on you.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,And you said Spock might not be able to handle him. If I can knock Spock out without really hurting him
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,"In this climate? If the heat doesn't get you, the thin air will. You can't do it!"
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,"If I get into any trouble, I'll quit. And Spock wins, and honour is satisfied."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,"Jim, listen, if you"
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,"Bones. He's my first officer and my friend. I disregarded Starfleet orders to bring him here. Another thing, that's T'Pau of Vulcan. All of Vulcan in one package. How can I back out in front of her?"
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,"It is done. Kirk, decide."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,I accept the challenge.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,"Here begins the act of combat for possession of the woman, T'Pring. As it was at the time of the beginning, so it is now. Bring forth the lirpa."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,,"They are presented with wicked-looking half moon blades set in a wooden shaft, with a counterweight at the other end.",
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,"If both survive the lirpa, combat will continue with the ahn woon."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,"What do you mean, if both survive?"
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,This combat is to the death.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,"Now wait a minute, ma'am. Who said anything about a fight to the death?"
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,These men are friends. To force them to fight until one of them is killed
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,I can forgive such a display only once. Challenge was given and lawfully accepted. It has begun. Let no one interfere.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,,"And so the fight begins, first with a trial of brute strength, then a good swing by Spock slices open Kirk's tunic and cuts his chest. It is clear that the first officer will kill his captain, given the chance. When Kirk is down and unarmed, Spock goes in for the final blow.",
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,Spock! No!
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,,"And Kirk rolls away just in time, then disarms Spock.",
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,Kroykah!
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,Is this Vulcan chivalry? The air's too hot and thin for Kirk. He's not used to it.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,The air is the air. What can be done?
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,holding up a hypo,I can compensate for the atmosphere and the temperature with this. At least it'll give Kirk a fighting chance.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,Thee may proceed.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,"You're going to have to kill him, Jim."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,"Kill Spock? That's not what I came to Vulcan for, is it? What's that?"
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,It's a tri-ox compound. It'll help you breathe. Now be careful!
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Kirk,,Sound medical advice.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,The ahn woon.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,,"The bells sound, and both men are given long straps with weights and tassels on the ends. Spock demonstrates it use by lassoing Kirk's legs and knocking him down with it before holding it in the middle to use first as a flail, and finally to strangle his opponent.",
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,Kroykah!
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Narrator,,"MCCOY; Get your hands off of him, Spock! He's finished. He's dead."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,I grieve with thee.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,McCoy to Enterprise.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Uhura,,Enterprise. Lieutenant Uhura here.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Mccoy,,"Have the transporter room stand by to beam up the landing party. (ends communication) As strange as it may seem, Mister Spock, you're in command now. Any orders?"
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Spock,,Yes. I'll follow you up in a few minutes. You will instruct Mister Chekov to plot a course for the nearest Starbase where I must surrender myself to the authorities. (the sound of a transporter off screen) T'Pring. Explain.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pring,,Specify.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Spock,,"Why the challenge, and why you chose my captain as your champion."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pring,,"Stonn wanted me, I wanted him."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Spock,,I see no logic in preferring Stonn over me.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pring,,"You have become much known among our people, Spock. Almost a legend. And as the years went by, I came to know that I did not want to be the consort of a legend. But by the laws of our people, I could only divorce you by the kal-if-fee. There was also Stonn, who wanted very much to be my consort, and I wanted him. If your Captain were victor, he would not want me, and so I would have Stonn. If you were victor you would free me because I had dared to challenge, and again I would have Stonn. But if you did not free me, it would be the same. For you would be gone, and I would have your name and your property, and Stonn would still be there."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Spock,,Logical. Flawlessly logical.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pring,,I am honoured.
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Spock,,"Stonn. She is yours. After a time, you may find that having is not so pleasing a thing after all as wanting. It is not logical, but it is often true. Spock here. Stand by to beam up. Live long, T'Pau, and prosper."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,T'Pau,,"Live long and prosper, Spock."
34,2,[Corridor],vulcan,Spock,,I shall do neither. I have killed my captain and my friend. Energize.
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Spock,,"Doctor, I shall be resigning my commission immediately, of course."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Mccoy,,"Spock, I"
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Spock,,So I would appreciate your making the final arrangements.
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Mccoy,,"Spock, I"
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Spock,,"Doctor, please, let me finish. There can be no excuse for the crime of which I'm guilty. I intend to offer no defence. Furthermore, I shall order Mister Scott to take immediate command of this vessel."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Kirk,,Don't you think you better check with me first?
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Spock,,Captain! Jim!
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,,"There's a big, big grin across his face, which fades when McCoy and Chapel's own smiles are noticed",
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Spock,,"I'm pleased to see you, Captain. You seem uninjured. I am at something of a loss to understand it, however."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Kirk,,"Blame McCoy. That was no tri-ox compound he shot me with. He slipped in a neural paralyser. Knocked me out, simulated death."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Spock,,Indeed.
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Mccoy,,"Nurse, would you mind, please?"
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,,Chapel leaves in a slight huff.,
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Mccoy,,"Spock, what happened down there? The girl? The wedding?"
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Spock,,"Ah, yes, the girl. Most interesting. It must have been the combat. When I thought I had killed the captain, I found I had lost all interest in T'Pring. The madness was gone."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,,Intercom whistle,
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Kirk,,Kirk here.
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Uhura,,"Captain Kirk. Message from Starfleet Command, top priority."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Kirk,,"Relay it, Lieutenant."
34,2,[Corridor],bridge,Uhura,,Response to T'Pau's request for diversion of Enterprise to planet Vulcan
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Uhura,,"Hereby approved. Any reasonable delay granted. Komack, Admiral, Starfleet Command."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Kirk,,"Well, a little late, but I'm glad they're seeing it our way. How about that T'Pau? They couldn't turn her down. Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Altair Six. Leave orbit when ready. Kirk out."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Mccoy,,"There's just one thing, Mister Spock. You can't tell me that when you first saw Jim alive that you weren't on the verge of giving us an emotional scene that would have brought the house down. ."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Spock,,Merely my quite logical relief that Starfleet had not lost a highly proficient captain.
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Kirk,,"Yes, Mister Spock. I understand."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Spock,,"Thank you, Captain."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Mccoy,,"Of course, Mister Spock, your reaction was quite logical."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Spock,,"Thank you, Doctor."
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Mccoy,,In a pig's eye!
34,2,[Corridor],sickbay,Kirk,,"Come on, Spock. Let's go mind the store."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,,"Plenty of security around, and a blonde woman instead of Uhura at communications.",
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Palmer,,The distress call definitely came from one of the solar systems in this sector.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,"Can you pinpoint it any closer, Lieutenant?"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Palmer,,"Negative. It was so badly garbled all we got was the name Constellation, then we lost it."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Sulu,,"Sir, we're now within the limits of System L-370, but I can't seem to locate"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, sensors show this entire solar system has been destroyed. Nothing left but rubble and asteroids."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,But that's incredible. The star in this system is still intact. Only a nova could destroy like that.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"Nonetheless, Captain, sensors show nothing but debris where we charted seven planets last year."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,Continue a search pattern.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, aye, sir."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,,Later.,
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Sulu,,"Entering limits of System L-374, sir. Scanners show the same evidence of destruction."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,Every solar system in this sector blasted to rubble and still no sign of the Constellation. Matt Decker's in command. What could have happened to him?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, the two inner most planets of this system appear to be intact."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Palmer,,"Sir, I'm picking up a ship's disaster beacon."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,"Try to raise it, Lieutenant."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"I have it on the sensors, Captain. By configuration, a starship stopped in space. She appears to be drifting."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Palmer,,"No answer, Captain. All I get is the automatic beacon."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,Sensors not recording normal energy output.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,"Approach course, Mister Sulu."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,,They arrive at a ship hanging crookedly in space. It looks identical to Enterprise.,
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,It's the Constellation. Look at that.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,She may have been wrecked by whatever destroyed these solar systems.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,She was attacked. Red alert! Red alert! Man your battle stations!
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Palmer,,Red alert. Red alert. Man your battle stations.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,Mister Sulu?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Sulu,,"All phaser banks manned and ready, sir."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,Very good. Initiate a full sensor scan of the immediate area for any other vessel.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, sir."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,Lieutenant Palmer.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Palmer,,"I can't raise the Constellation, sir. I'm still getting the distress beacon, but there's heavy subspace interference. It's almost blocking the signal."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,"Keep trying. Mister Spock, full evaluation of the damage to the Constellation."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"All power plants dead, reserve energy banks operative at a very low power level."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,Life support systems?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,Also operative at a low power level. The entire Bridge is damaged and uninhabitable. The rest of the ship seems able to sustain life.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,Radiation levels?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"Normal, but subspace interference makes readings difficult."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Sulu,,"No other vessels in the area, Captain. All scanners show clear."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,"All hands, go to Yellow Alert. Stand by battle stations. Lieutenant, have Doctor McCoy, Mister Scott, and a damage control party report to me in the transporter room."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Palmer,,"Aye, aye, sir."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,"We're going to board her. Mister Spock, you're in command."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,Acknowledged.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation corridor,,"The name ship for the Constellation-class is a mess, with chunks blown out of her nacelles and saucer. Inside, pipes are hanging down, twisted.",

35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation corridor,Kirk,,"Scotty, check the phaser banks. See if they've been fired. Bones, you come with me."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation corridor,Scott,,"Come along, lads."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation corridor,,They head down a ladder while McCoy and Kirk walk off.,
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation engineering,Washburn,,What a mess.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation room,Kirk,,"No clutter, no half-empty cups of coffee. Whatever happened didn't happen without a warning."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation engineering,Washburn,,"What do you think did it, sir?"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation engineering,Scott,,"I don't know, lad. But I want a full structural and control damage check, and I'm going to have a look at those engines."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation room,Kirk,,"The crew wasn't abducted, they just left. Kirk to Enterprise."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation room,Spock,,"Enterprise, Spock here."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation room,Kirk,,"No survivors, no bodies either."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,Is it possible they could have beamed down to one of the two planets?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"Improbable, Captain. The surface temperature of the inner planet is that of molten lead. The other has an atmosphere poisonous to human life."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation room,Kirk,,We'll continue our search. Kirk out.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation corridor,,Scott returns to the beam-in point.,
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation corridor,Scott,,"Captain, I've checked the engines. The warp drive is a hopeless pile of junk. The impulse engines are not too badly off. We ought to be able to do something with them."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation corridor,Kirk,,Phaser banks?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation corridor,Scott,,Exhausted. They didn't give up without a battle.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation corridor,Kirk,,But where are they? I can't imagine a man like Matt Decker abandoning ship while his life support systems were still operative.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation corridor,Scott,,Computer system is still intact. We can playback the duplicate Captain's Log from the auxiliary control room.

35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,Matt? Matt.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Decker,,Kirk. It's Jim Kirk.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"What happened to your ship, Matt?"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Decker,,"A ship. Attacked. That, that thing."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,What thing? What was it?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Decker,,That
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Answer me! What was it? What happened, Matt?"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Mccoy,,"Jim, give him a minute. He's in a state of shock."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Scott,,"Ready with the duplicate log, sir."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,Go.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Decker,,"Captain's log, stardate 4202.1. Exceptionally heavy subspace interference still prevents our contacting Starfleet to inform them of the destroyed solar systems we have encountered. We are now entering system L-374. Science Officer Masada reports the fourth planet seems to be breaking up. We are going to investigate."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"The fourth planet. Only two left now. Scotty, pull the microtapes from the sensor memory banks and beam them aboard to Spock. I want a full analysis, a complete report of what happened when they went in on that planet."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Decker,,We tried to contact Starfleet. No one heard. No one! We couldn't run.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,What happened to your crew?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Decker,,"Oh, I had to beam them down. We were dead. No power, our phasers useless. I stayed behind, the last man. The Captain, the last man aboard the ship. That's what you're supposed to do, isn't it? And then it hit again and the transporter went out. They were down there, and I'm up here."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,What hit? What attacked you?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Decker,,"They say there's no devil, Jim, but there is. Right out of hell, I saw it."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Matt, where's your crew?"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Decker,,On the third planet.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,There is no third planet.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Decker,,"Don't you think I know that? There was, but not anymore. They called me. They begged me for help, four hundred of them. I couldn't. I couldn't. (breaks down in tears)"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Scott,,"Captain, Washburn has our report."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,Go.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Washburn,,"We made a complete check on structural and control damage, sir. As far as we can tell, something crashed through the deflectors and knocked out the generators. Somehow the antimatter in the warp drive pods has been deactivated."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Deactivated? Scotty, could some kind of general energy dampening field do that, and would the same type of thing account for the heavy subspace interference?"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Scott,,"Aye, that all adds up. But what sort of a thing could do all that?"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Decker,,"If you'd seen it, you'd know. The whole thing's a weapon. It must be."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,What does it look like?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Decker,,"Well, it's miles long, with a maw that could swallow a dozen starships. It destroys planets, chops them into rubble."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"What is it, an alien ship? Or is it alive, or is it"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Decker,,Both or neither. I don't know.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Matt, your log stated that the fourth planet was breaking up. You went in to investigate."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Decker,,"We saw this thing hovering over the planet, slicing out chunks of it with a force beam."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,Did you run a scanner check on it? What kind of a beam?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Decker,,Pure antiproton. Absolutely pure.

35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Spock,,"Spock here, Captain."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,Unable to raise Starfleet Command due to heavy subspace interference.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Spock,,Attempting to remedy.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,What about the Constellation's tapes?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"She was attacked by what appears to be essentially a robot, an automated weapon of immense size and power. Its apparent function is to smash planets to rubble and then digest the debris for fuel. It is, therefore, self-sustaining as long as there are planetary bodies for it to feed on."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,A robot weapon that purposely destroys entire solar systems. Why?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"Unknown, Captain. However, Mister Sulu has computed the path of the machine, using the destroyed solar systems as a base course. Projecting back on our star charts, we find that it came from outside, from another galaxy."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,What is the projected course of this thing?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"If it follows its present path, it will go through the most densely populated section of our galaxy."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Thank you. Stand by, Mister Spock. Kirk out."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Mccoy,,"This whole thing's incredible. A robot? A machine like that, who would build it?"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"We don't know. An alien race, apparently from another galaxy."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Mccoy,,But why?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Bones, did you ever hear of a doomsday machine?"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Mccoy,,"No. I'm a doctor, not a mechanic."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"It's a weapon built primarily as a bluff. It's never meant to be used. So strong, it could destroy both sides in a war. Something like the old H-Bomb was supposed to be. That's what I think this is. A doomsday machine that somebody used in a war uncounted years ago. They don't exist anymore, but the machine is still destroying."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Decker,,"Oh, forget about your theories! That thing is on the way to the heart of our galaxy. What are you going to do about it?"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,Take it easy.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Mccoy,,The first thing we're going to do is get you back to the Enterprise.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Decker,,"Oh, no, I stay here. I'm not leaving my ship!"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,There's no ship to leave. It's a dead hulk! We'll take her in tow. I'll stay onboard and get her ready. You go back to the Enterprise with the doctor and let him help you.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Decker,,"It's just that I, I, I never lost a command before."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise. Have the transporter room beam Doctor McCoy and Commodore Decker on board immediately.

35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"It came up on us fast, Captain, but we seem able to maintain our distance."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,We're blind here. What's it look like?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,,"Decker and McCoy enter. The viewscreen shows a thing with a big yellow maw, that tapers down along it's body to a pointed tail.",
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,It looks very much like Commodore Decker's planet killer. And it is pursuing us. (The viewscreen now shows it head-on. A round opening with a small sun partway down the gullet.)
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"We are more manoeuvrable, but it is gaining on us. Sensors indicate some kind of total conversion drive."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Spock,,"No evidence of life, subspace interference level incredibly high."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Whatever it is, we can't let it go beyond us to the next solar system. We have to stop it. If it's a robot, what are the chances of deactivating it?"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"I would say none, Captain. The energy generated by our power nacelles seems to attracts it. I doubt we could manoeuvre close enough without drawing a direct attack upon ourselves."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Spock,,I also believe the nature of this machine precludes the possibility of easy access to its control mechanisms.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Sulu,,"It's closing on us, Mister Spock."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"Closing, Captain."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,All right. Lower your deflector screens Long enough to beam us aboard.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Spock,,Acknowledged.

35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,Kirk here.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, we've been attacked. The transporter is damaged. We're taking evasive action."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Palmer,,"Mister Spock, communication's damaged. We're unable to override interference."

35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Scott,,And paralysed. No power.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Well, we just can't stand around while our ship is being attacked. Scotty, you've got to get me some manoeuvering power."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Scott,,I can't repair warp drive without a spacedock.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Then get me impulse power. Half-speed, quarter-speed, anything. If we get this hulk moving, maybe we can do something."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Scott,,"Aye, the impulse engines are still in fair shape. I might coax them."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,Then get moving.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Scott,,"Come on, lad."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Washburn, you get in there. Let's see what we can do about this viewing screen. I've got to find out what's happening out there."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Mccoy,,"No casualties, Mister Spock. How are we doing?"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"We have outrun it, Doctor."

35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Mccoy,,"In plain, non-Vulcan English, we've been lucky."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"I believe I said that, Doctor."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Sulu,,"It's veering off, back on course for the next solar system. The Rigel colony, sir."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,Evidently programmed to ignore anything as small as a ship beyond a certain radius. We'll maintain a discreet distance and circle back to pick up the Captain.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Decker,,"You can't let that reach Rigel. Why, millions of innocent people would die."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"I am aware of the Rigel system's population, Commodore, but we are only one ship. Our deflector shields are strained, our subspace transmitter is useless. Logically, our primary duty is to survive in order to warn Starfleet Command."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Decker,,Our primary duty is to maintain life and safety of Federation planets. Do you deny that?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"Mister Sulu, you will lay in an evasive course back to the Constellation."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, aye, sir."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Decker,,"Belay that last order, helmsman. One hundred and eighty degree turn, hard about. We're going to attack."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,,The whole Bridge holds its breath.,
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"You will carry out my last order, Mister Sulu."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Decker,,"Mister Spock, I'm officially notifying you that I'm exercising my option under regulations as a Starfleet Commodore, and that I am assuming command of the Enterprise."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"You have the right to do so, but I would advise against it."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Decker,,That thing must be destroyed.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"You tried to destroy it once before, Commodore. The result was a wrecked ship and a dead crew."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Decker,,I made a mistake then. We were too far away. This time I'm going to hit it with full phasers at point-blank range.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,Sensors show the object's hull is solid neutronium. A single ship cannot combat it.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Decker,,"Mister Spock, that will be all. You have been relieved of command. Don't force me to relieve you of duty as well."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Mccoy,,"You can't let him do this, Spock."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Decker,,"Doctor, you are out of line."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Mccoy,,"So are you, sir. Well, Spock?"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"Unfortunately, Starfleet Order 104, Section B, leaves me no alternative. Paragraph 1A clearly states"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Mccoy,,To blazes with regulations! You can't let him take command when you know he's wrong!
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"If you can certify Commodore Decker medically or psychologically unfit for command, I can relieve him under Section C."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Mccoy,,I'll certify that right now.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,You'll also be asked to produce your medical records to prove it.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Mccoy,,"Now, you know I haven't had time to run an examination on him."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,Then your statement would not be considered valid.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Decker,,"You may leave the Bridge, Doctor."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Mccoy,,What about the Captain? We can't leave
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Decker,,"Doctor, you may leave the Bridge."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Mccoy,,"Spock, do something!"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Decker,,"Mister Spock knows his duty under regulations, Doctor. Do you? (McCoy leaves) Hard about, helmsman. Course thirty two degrees, mark ten. Deflectors at full power. Ready on main phaser banks."

35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"The drop in power is definite, Captain but negligible. The object is still pursing us, thereby causing us to drain our power reserve at a much greater rate."

35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kyle,,"Aye, aye, sir."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Spock, listen. Maybe Matt Decker didn't die for nothing. He had the right idea but not enough power to do it. Am I correct in assuming that a fusion explosion of ninety seven megatons will result if a starship impulse engine is overloaded?"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"No, sir. Ninety seven point eight three five megatons."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,Ninety seven point eight three five. Will it be powerful enough to destroy that thing out there?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"Negative, Captain. Its hull is pure neutronium. There is no known way of blasting through it."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Not through it, Spock, from inside it. Will it be enough?"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,Insufficient data. I shall try to take further sensor readings.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,Do the best you can and make it fast. Kirk to Scott.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation engineering,Scott,,"Here, sir. The damage control party just beamed back to the Enterprise."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Good. Scotty, can you set the ship's impulse engines to overload?"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation engineering,Scott,,"Aye. The shape the thing's in, it's hard to keep her from blowing."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Narrator,,"KIRK I want you to rig a thirty second delay detonation device, and rig it so that it can be blown from up here."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation engineering,Scott,,"Aye, sir."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,Set it and get up here as fast as you can.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Scott,,Right away.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Spock,,Captain?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,The object's neutronium hull makes sensor readings of the inner mechanism impossible.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Spock, you don't know?"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Spock,,Correct.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, you're getting dangerously close to the planet killer."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,I intend to get a lot closer. I'm going to ram her right down that thing's throat.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"Jim, you'll be killed, just like Decker."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"No. No, I don't intend to die, Mister Spock. We've rigged a delay detonation device. You'll have thirty seconds to beam me aboard the Enterprise before the Constellation's impulse engines blow."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,Your chances of survival are not promising. We don't even know if the explosion will be powerful enough.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"A calculated risk, Mister Spock."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Spock,,"There's another factor, Captain. The transporter is not working at one hundred percent efficiency."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,Thirty seconds is very slim timing.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,A chance I'll have to take. Kirk out.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Scott,,"A cranky transporter's a mighty finicky piece of machinery to be gambling your life on, sir."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,What about the detonator?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Scott,,"I've linked it in with the impulse control system. (flips a switch) It's armed now. Press this one. Thirty seconds later, poof! Once it's activated, there's no way to stop it."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,Understood. Mister Spock. Prepare to beam Scotty on board.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Spock,,"Transporter, stand by."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Scott,,"Good luck, Captain."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,Thank you.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,transporter room,,It takes longer than usual to materialise Mister Scott.,
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,transporter room,Scott,,What's the matter with that thing?
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,transporter room,Kyle,,"It's a power drain somewhere, sir. I almost lost you."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,transporter room,Scott,,It'll never work like this. It's the main junction circuitry. I'll get it.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,transporter room,Kyle,,Bridge. Transporter malfunction.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"Transporter is out, Captain. You'll have to stand by."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,I can't. Power level's dropping too fast. You'd better hurry.

35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Sulu,,Fifteen hundred miles and closing.
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, transporter operational, but just barely."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,Prepare to beam me aboard on my signal.

35,2,The Doomsday Machine,jefferies tube,Scott,,"Och, what's wrong with it?"
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Gentlemen, beam me aboard."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,constellation auxiliary control,Spock,,"We can't, Captain. Transporter is out again."

35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Sulu, ease us back to minimum headway. Conserve power as much as possible. Lieutenant Palmer, tell Mister Scott to expedite repairs on the warp drive. Poor Matt. He gave his life in an attempt to save others. Not the worst way to go."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"Indeed, Captain. I presume your log will show that Commodore Decker died in the line of duty."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,"Indeed it shall, Mister Spock. Ironic, isn't it? Way back in the 20th century, the H-Bomb was the ultimate weapon, their doomsday machine, and we used something like it to destroy another doomsday machine. Probably the first time such a weapon has ever been used for constructive purposes."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Spock,,"Appropriate, Captain. However, I can't help wondering if there are any more of those weapons wandering around the universe."
35,2,The Doomsday Machine,bridge,Kirk,,"Well, I certainly hope not. I found one quite sufficient."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,,"A woman is doing a belly-dance, complete with finger-cymbals, while the patrons lounge on cushions. The audience are appreciating the show.",
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Scott,,"Captain, I think I'm going to like Argelius."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Kirk,,Obviously a man of good taste.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Scott,,"You mean to tell me all these women, that all this is"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Kirk,,"Yes, yes, yes. The Argelians think very highly of their pleasure."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Mccoy,,That's an understatement if I ever heard one. This is a completely hedonistic society.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Kirk,,"Do you like her, Scotty?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Scott,,Aye. Why shouldn't I?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Kirk,,Good. I've invited her to join us at the table. I thought you might like to meet her.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Scott,,Now that's what I call a real Captain. Always thinking of his men.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,,"The dancer comes over, bends over backwards then does a shimmy before returning to the small stage to finish. Scotty bangs on the table in applause.",

36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Scott,,"'Tis a fine foggy night tonight, and I doubt if anyone's ever told you of the marvellous fogs we have in Aberdeen."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Kara,,"Never a word, but I'm dying to learn."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Scott,,"Well then, why don't I show you? There's nothing like a walk in the fog with a bonny lass."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Kara,,Or a handsome gentleman. Why don't we?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Scott,,"You don't mind, do you? I might even get back to the ship on time."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Kirk,,"We won't leave without you, Scotty. Relax and enjoy yourself. (Scott and Kara leave) My work is never done."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Mccoy,,"My work, Jim. This is prescription stuff. Don't forget, the explosion that threw Scotty against a bulkhead was caused by a woman."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Kirk,,Physically he's all right. Am I right in assuming that?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Mccoy,,"Oh, yes, yes. As a matter of fact, considerable psychological damage could have been caused. For example, his total resentment toward women."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Kirk,,He seems he's overcoming his resentment.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Mccoy,,"Of course, in my professional opinion, when he gets back to the ship, he's going to hate you for making him leave Argelius. But then he will have lost total resentment toward women."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Kirk,,"Mission accomplished as far as Scotty is concerned. Bones, I know a little place across town where the women"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Mccoy,,Oh yes. I know the place. Let's go.

36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Hengist,,"Oh, no. Argelius hires its administrative officers from other planets. The Argelians aren't very efficient, you know. Gentle, harmless people. Mister Scott. Mister Scott? Now, are you sure you've never seen this before? (the knife)"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Scott,,"I, I don't remember."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Hengist,,"Really, sir. That is hardly helpful."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Kirk,,"Scotty, you left the cafe with the girl. Do you remember that? What happened next?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Scott,,We were walking in the fog. I was up ahead trying to lead the way. I heard the girl scream. I remember starting to turn. I don't remember another thing.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Kirk,,"Scotty, you've got to remember."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Mccoy,,"Jim. (they move off a little way) If he says he can't remember, he probably doesn't. You know Scotty."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Kirk,,I know a murder's been committed.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Mccoy,,You don't think by any chance that Scotty
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Kirk,,It doesn't make any difference what I think.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Mccoy,,But you don't just throw him to the wolves.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Kirk,,"Bones, I have a diplomatic responsibility. This happened under Argelian jurisdiction. If they want to arrest him, try him, even convict him, I have to go along with it."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Mccoy,,But he's suffering from a severe concussion.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Kirk,,We'll do what we can.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Hengist,,"It's not promising, Captain. Mister Scott insists he remembers nothing, but my detector readings indicates that only his fingerprints are on the murder weapon."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Kirk,,"Yes. Mister Hengist, there were other people in the cafe about the time of the murder. Several of them left just before Mister Scott and the girl did."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Hengist,,So I've been informed by the staff. They're being located and we will question them. But the outlook for your friend is quite grim.

36,2,Wolf In The Fold,cafe,Jaris,,"He does not look like a man capable of such an act. Still, it's been so long. Gentlemen, before our great awakening two hundred years ago, we had ways of learning the truth in such matters. We shall return to them."

Since you find it impossible to let us go back up to our ship, I can beam down a technician with a psycho-tricorder."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Mccoy,,"Prefect, it will give us a detailed account of everything that's happened to Mister Scott in the last twenty four hours."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Hengist,,"Oh, I'd advise against it, Prefect. This is purely an Argelian matter."

36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Jaris,,"There is a small chamber below this room. Perhaps that will suffice. Captain, news of this frightful murder is spreading among my people. They're greatly disturbed. I have already heard talk of closing Argelius to space vehicles."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,"Well, that would be most unfortunate. Argelian hospitality is well-known, as well as its strategic importance as a space port."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Jaris,,Yes. I believe it's the only one in the quadrant. (hands out drinks) Captain.

36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,What happened down there?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Scott,,"I was sitting there. She was taking her readings, and now I'm sitting here."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Mccoy,,Is that all that happened?

36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,You. You were a musician at the cafe. You played for the murdered girl.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Tark,,"Since she was a little girl, she danced for me. She was my daughter. Prefect, how could this thing have happened here? The man who did it must be found. He must be punished."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,And you. You left the cafe before Scott and Kara.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Jaris,,Is this true? Who are you?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Morla,,"Morla of Cantaba Street, Prefect. I was there. I have nothing to hide."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,Did you know Kara?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Tark,,"Of course he knew her. They were to be married, but he behaved disgracefully. Unheard of. He was jealous of her."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Jaris,,That is very disquieting.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Morla,,"I know it was wrong, but I just couldn't help myself. I loved her, and when she went over to the table with these men, I could not stand to watch, so I left and went home."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,Jealousy has often been a motive for murder.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Jaris,,"Yes, I know. That is why the emotion is so strongly disapproved of here."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Morla,,"Prefect, I didn't kill anyone. I couldn't."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Jaris,,"We shall see, Morla."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Mccoy,,"Sorry, Jim. The lock may or may not have been picked. It would be hard to tell even with the tricorder."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,Can you prove you went directly home?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Hengist,,"Captain, may I continue with the questions please?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,"Well get on with it, man. Just don't stand there."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Jaris,,"Captain, Captain. You're behaving very much like a man who is desperately trying anything to save his friend. Would you be as desperate to save Argelius as a space port for your Starfleet?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,"Well of course I'm trying to save my friend, if he's innocent. And he hasn't been proven guilty."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Hengist,,"Need I remind you of the circumstances, Captain? In both cases, your friend Scott was discovered over the body and later claimed to remember nothing."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Sybo,,"I am ready, Jaris."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Jaris,,"Gentlemen, sit down please."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,,Everyone sits around the central brazier.,
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,"On one condition, Prefect. That the room be sealed so that no one can leave or enter while the ceremony is going on."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Jaris,he flicks a row of switches and the doorways are closed,The room is sealed.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Scott,,"Captain, you mean my neck is going to have to depend on some spooky mumbo jumbo?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,,Kirk's communicator beeps.,
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,Kirk here.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Spock,,"Spock here, Captain. May I have a word with you?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,"Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen. (moves away from the group) Yes, Mister Spock?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Spock,,"Concerning the situation you related to us. In my opinion, the Argelian empathic contact is an interesting phenomenon, but the technique is not sound enough to risk a man's life."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,"What do you suggest, Mister Spock?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Spock,,Simply that we beam Mister Scott on board the Enterprise and employ our computers to learn the truth.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,"These are a proud people. They have their own customs, their own laws, and while we're here we're subject to them. It is absolutely imperative that this matter be resolved according to Argelian law. Is that clear?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Spock,,"Quite clear, Captain."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,"I don't like it any more than you do, Spock, but there's nothing we can do about it. Kirk out,"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,,Everyone is holding hands around the brazier.,
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Sybo,,Let us begin. Let the circle not be broken. Concentrate upon the flame which burns upon the altar of truth.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Narrator,,"Yes, there is something here. Something terrible. I feel its presence. Fear, anger, hatred. Anger feeds the flame. Oh! Oh! There is evil here. Monstrous, terrible evil. Consuming hunger. Hatred of all that lives. Hatred of women. A hunger that never dies. It is strong, overpowering. An ancient terror. It has a name. Beratis, Kesla, Redjac! Devouring all life, all light. A hunger that will never die! Redjac! Redjac!"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,,"The lights go out, and she screams. When the lights come on again, the flame has gone out. Scott is standing holding Sybo in his arms, then he lets her go and she falls forward across McCoy's lap. There is a knife in her back",

36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,"Three murders, and Scotty the only possible answer each time."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Mccoy,,"I don't care what the circumstances indicate, Jim. Scotty simply could not have done it."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,"Normally, no, but that blow on his head could"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Scott,,"No, Captain."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Narrator,,"KIRK Scotty, I'm sorry. You don't even remember whether you did it or not."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Hengist,,"I agree with you, Captain. I'm perfectly satisfied Mister Scott is guilty."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,But not responsible.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Hengist,,"That is unproven, sir."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,"We can prove it, if he's insane."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Jaris,,"Gentlemen, please. How could any man do such monstrous things?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,"That's what we hope to find out, sir."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Jaris,,Mister Scott?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Scott,,"Sir, I swear to you I did not kill your wife or the other ladies."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Hengist,,"By your own admission, you don't know whether you did or didn't. Your so-called failing memory"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,"Mister Hengist. On the Enterprise, we can make a recording of the registrations of Mister Scott's conscious and subconscious mind. They will tell us what happened to him in the recent past."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Mccoy,,"There would be no room for doubt. We would know. And after all, that's what we're after, isn't it, Prefect? To know?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Jaris,,"You, sir, claim to remember nothing about the murders."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Scott,,Aye.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Jaris,,"If this is so, you may have killed without knowing it. Will your machines tell us this?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Kirk,,No doubt will remain.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Jaris,,"Very well. We will go to your ship, and he who is guilty will face the ancient penalties, barbaric and horrible though they may be. The ancient penalty for murder was death by slow torture. That law has never been changed. Do you understand that, Mister Scott?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Scott,,Aye. I understand.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,jaris' home,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 3615.4. With Mister Scott in a technical state of arrest, we have beamed aboard the Enterprise to continue the investigation."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"Each testifier will sit here, place his hand on this plate. Any deviation from factual truth will be immediately detected and relayed to this computer which will in turn notify us. Doctor McCoy has already fed the computer his medical reports. Our laboratory experts are examining the murder weapon and will give their data to the computers for analysis. Shall we begin?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,,Jaris nods.,
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"Mister Scott, will you take the stand?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,,Scott sits on the raised chair and puts his right hand on the sensor plate. Yet at no time does the camera let us see all his finger.,
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"Computer, identify verification."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Computer,,Working. Lieutenant Commander Montgomery Scott. Serial number SE-19754-T. Verified.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,Subject's present physical condition.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Computer,,Working. Subject recently received severe blow on skull. Damage healing. Some peripheral abnormalities.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,Sufficient abnormalities to account for periods of functional amnesia?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Computer,,Working. Negative.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Captain, I don't see how that can be."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,Unless Scotty's lying about his loss of memory.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Scott,,"I'm not lying, Captain. I don't remember a thing about the first two murders."

36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Scott,,Captain? I didn't black out when Mister Jaris' wife was killed.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"All right, Scotty, let's have it."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Scott,,"We were holding hands. When the lights went out, the circle was broken. I heard the poor lady scream, and as I was near the head of the table anyway I went toward her. But there was something in my way."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,Something? You mean someone.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Scott,,"No, Captain, some thing. Cold, it was, like a stinking draught out of a slaughterhouse, but it wasn't really there. Like it. (lost for words) If you know what I mean."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,Computer.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Computer,,Subject relaying accurate account. No physiological changes.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"All right. Let's hit it on the head. Scotty, did you kill Sybo?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Scott,,"No, Captain. That I'm sure of."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Hengist,,He's been saying that right along. It means no more now than it did before.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"Scotty, lie to me. How old are you?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Scott,,Twenty two sir.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Computer,,Inaccurate. Inaccurate. Data in error.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"After the lights went out, Mister Scott, who was holding your hand?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Scott,,"Morla on the one side and you on the other, sir."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Morla,,"But that doesn't mean anything, Captain, with a room that small. The lights were out. Anyone would've had time to kill the lady."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Hengist,,"But I remind you we found Mister Scott holding her in his arms, the knife still (to Jaris) I'm sorry, sir, but I must. The knife still in her back and blood on his hands."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,The verifier showed that he was telling the truth when he said he didn't kill her.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Hengist,,There were two other women murdered.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,Mister Scott. Did you kill Kara?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Scott,,I don't remember.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Scott,,I don't remember.

36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Computer,,Subject relaying accurate account. No physiological changes.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Jaris,,All that proves is that he's telling the truth when he says he doesn't remember.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Hengist,,This is a waste of time.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"After we take the testimony here, we'll run a psycho-tricorder analysis of Mister Scott's memory, which is what we wanted to do on the surface. That will give us a complete record. Will that satisfy you, Mister Hengist?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Hengist,,"Well, if you can convince me that the machine is incapable of error, and if it shows he did not kill the women."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"There will be no error. As for the rest of it, the readings will show. You can step down, Mister Scott, if there are no objections."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Hengist,,I object to the entire procedure.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Jaris,,"Mister Hengist, we are here on my authority. We will co-operate."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Hengist,,"Prefect, I know you mean well, but I've had experience"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Jaris,,"For the time being, we will accept Captain Kirk's explanation of the machine's accuracy as factual. I do, however, reserve to myself the right to make the final determination."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"We can ask no more. Mister Morla, will you take the stand?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,,He does so.,
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,Where were you at the time that Kara was murdered?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Morla,,"I'm not sure. Walking home, I assume. I was angry."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"Anger is a relative state, sir. Were you angry enough to do violence?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Morla,,"I've never done violence in my life. I don't think I could. You've got to believe me. I wouldn't kill her. I couldn't. I loved her, and she loved me."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Tark,,"That's not true! He might think she loved him, but she didn't. She told me. He was jealous. All the time. They fought constantly."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Morla,,No.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,Did you kill Sybo?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Morla,,No.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"Computer, verification scan."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Computer,,"Subject relaying accurate account, though some statements subjective. No physiological changes."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"All right, Mister Morla, I think you can step down now. Sybo spoke of a hunger that never dies. Something that thrives on fear, terror, death. Mister Spock, maybe we're going about it in the wrong way. Let's assume that Sybo was a sensitive. That she did sense something, something evil."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"Sensitivity of certain Argelian women is a documented fact, Captain."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Jaris,,"My poor Sybo's talent was genuine, gentlemen. What she told you was true."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"All right, then, what was it she said, exactly? A monstrous evil, ancient terror."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Mccoy,,That devours all life and light.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"She said something else, words that didn't make sense."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Yes. Redjac, Beratis and, er, Kesla."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"Obscure, meaningless words."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"To us, perhaps, but to the computer?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"Ah. Mister Spock, check them out."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"Computer, linguistic bank. Definition of following word. Redjac."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Computer,,Working. Negative finding.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,There is no such word in the linguistics bank?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Computer,,Affirmative.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,Scan all other banks.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Computer,,Working. Affirmative. A proper name.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,Define.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Computer,,"Redjac. Source Earth, nineteenth century. Language, English. Nickname for mass murderer of women. Other Earth synonym, Jack the Ripper."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,Jack the Ripper?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Hengist,,That's ridiculous. He lived hundreds of years ago.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Tark,,A man couldn't survive all these centuries.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Jaris,,"Just before she died, my wife said, it is a hunger that never dies."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Tark,,But all men die.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"Yes, all men die. And Jack the Ripper couldn't be alive if he were a man. But everything we've uncovered points to Jack the Ripper, which is an impossibility, isn't it? Or is it?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"Humans and humanoids make up only a small percentage of the life forms we know of. There are entities possessed of extremely long life spans, virtually immortal."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"We know that someone or something killed three women. If it's impossible for it to be human, it has to be something else. Something driven to kill."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Mccoy,,Sybo said it feeds on death.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"In the strict scientific sense, Doctor, we all feed on death. Even vegetarians."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Yes, but she said more than that. Not just death, but fear. She said it also feeds on fear."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"Which would tend to support the proposition that the murderer was not human. Deriving sustenance from emotion is not unknown in the galaxy, and fear is among the strongest and most violent of the emotions."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Hengist,,"Surely, Prefect, this has gone far enough. Someone, some man has killed three women. We have the prime suspect in our hands. Are we going to let him go and start chasing ghosts?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"No, Mister Hengist, not ghosts. Possibly not human, but not ghosts. Mister Spock, check out the possibilities."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"Computer, digest log recordings for past five solar minutes. Correlate hypotheses. Compare with life forms register. Question. Could such an entity within discussed limits exist in this galaxy?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Computer,,"The Drella of Alpha Carinae Five derives nourishment from the emotion of love. There is sufficient precedent for existence of creature, nature unknown, which could exist on emotion of fear."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"Computer, extrapolate most likely composition of such entity."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"Working. To meet with specified requirements, entity would exist without form in conventional sense. Most probable mass of energy of highly cohesive electromagnetic field."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"Computer, could the described entity assume physical form?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Computer,,"Affirmative. Precedent, mellitus, cloud creature of Alpha Majoris One."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Hengist,,Fairy tales. Ghosts and goblins.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"No, I've seen the mellitus myself. In its natural state, it's gaseous. When it's at rest, it's solid. Mister Spock, let's assume the existence of this creature."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,I point out that Jack the Ripper slew at will in the heart of the most populous city of old Earth and was never identified.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"Doesn't seem likely, does it?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"I suggest the possibility of a hypnotic screen, which blinds all but the victim to the presence of the killer."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Jaris,,Is that possible?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Mccoy,,Extremely possible There are many such examples that exist in nature.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Hengist,,This is fantasy! We all know the murderer is sitting right here. You're trying to cloud the issue. I've got a mind to
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Jaris,,"I am satisfied the course of this investigation is valid enough. Please be seated, Mister Hengist."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"All right, Mister Spock, what do we have? A creature without form, that feeds on horror and fear, that must assume a physical shape to kill."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"And I suspect preys on women because women are more easily and more deeply terrified, generating more sheer horror than the male of the species."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,Computer. Criminological files. Cases of unsolved mass murders of women since Jack the Ripper.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Computer,,"Working. 1932. Shanghai, China, Earth. Seven women knifed to death. 1974, Kiev, USSR, Earth. Five women knifed to death. 2105. Martian colonies. Eight women knifed to death. 2156. Heliopolis, Alpha Eridani Two. Ten women knifed to death. There are additional examples."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"Captain, those places are aligned directly between Argelius and Earth."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"Yes. When man moved out into the galaxy, that thing must've moved with him. Computer, identify the proper names Kesla and Beratis."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Computer,,Working. Kesla. Name given to unidentified mass murderer of women on planet Deneb Two. Beratis. Name given to unidentified mass murderer of women on planet Rigel Four. Additional data. Murders on Rigel Four occurred one solar year ago.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,,All heads turn towards Mister Hengist,
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,You come from Rigel Four.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Hengist,,"Well, many people do. It's not a crime."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"No, but what we're investigating is. Would you mind taking the stand, Mister Hengist?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Hengist,,I will not.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Jaris,,Mister Hengist.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Hengist,,"Prefect, this has gone far enough. I will not take the stand."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"I can appreciate your position, sir. You are in charge of civil disturbances locally. If you are the entity for which we search, what better position from which to kill with impunity?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Just after you left Jaris' house, we discovered the murder knife was missing."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,And you were unaccounted for when Lieutenant Tracy was murdered.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"An entity which feeds on fear and terror would find a perfect hunting ground on Argelius, a planet without violence, where the inhabitants are as peaceful as sheep. The entity would be as a hungry wolf in that fold."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Hengist,,"Gentlemen, I know something of the law. You're engaging in sheer speculation."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,Perhaps. Mister Spock. The murder weapon.

36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"It's no use, Captain. The bypass circuits are blocked."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"Audio cut off, Spock."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Scott,,Captain!
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,,"The viewscreen has an image of hot swirling flames or lava. Anyway, it is fear-inducing.",
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Tankris,a lady yeoman,"What's happening, Captain?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Jaris,,What does it mean?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"It means that thing can control the entire operation of the ship, including the life support systems."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Morla,,You mean it could kill us all?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"Indeed, it will try, but not immediately. We know it feeds on fear and terror. There are nearly four hundred and forty humans aboard this ship. Surely it will try to breed fear and terror before it kills."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"All hands, this is the captain. Stay at your posts. Remain calm. Captain out. Bones. What's the sedative situation?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Mccoy,,I've got some stuff that would tranquillise an active volcano.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"Good. Start distribution immediately. The longer we can hold back that fear, the more time we'll have to get that thing out of the computer. Prefect, you'll all be safer here. Spock, come with me."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,corridor,Kirk,,"Spock, don't you have a compulsory scan unit built into the computer banks?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,corridor,Spock,,"Yes we do, Captain, but with the entity in control"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,corridor,Kirk,,Aren't there certain mathematical problems which simply cannot be solved?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,corridor,Spock,,Indeed. If we could focus the attention of the computer on one of them.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,corridor,Kirk,,That ought to do it.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,turbolift,Kirk,,Spock!
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,turbolift,,The door nearly closes before he is inside.,
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,turbolift,Spock,,Apparently our friends learned very quickly.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,turbolift,Kirk,,Too quickly. Bridge.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,turbolift,,"But the lights indicate they are going down quickly, not up.",
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,turbolift,Spock,,Freefall!
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,turbolift,Kirk,,Out of control. Put it on manual. Bridge.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,turbolift,,"They start going up, then an alarm goes off.",
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,turbolift,Kirk,,That was due to be next. Life-support malfunction.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,turbolift,Spock,,"We don't have much time, Captain."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,turbolift,Kirk,,"You said it yourself, Spock. It wants terror, not just death."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, the life-support system override jammed."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Kirk,,"All right. Man your station, Mister Sulu."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, sir."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Voice,,"Captain, you're wasting your time."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Kirk,,Cut that thing off.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Voice,,You and all aboard your ship are about to die!
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Kirk,,Try and cut that thing off.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Sulu,,This is the first time I heard a malfunction threaten us.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Kirk,,"Man your post, Mister Sulu. (to all the crew) Prepare your manual overrides. You may need them."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, sir."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,,Kirk crouches down by Spock under the life-support station.,
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Kirk,,Spock.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Spock,,"Normal environmental levels have been restored, Captain, but it will not last long. A few hours at best."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Kirk,,That should be enough time. Let's get at it.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Sulu,,"What's going on, Captain?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Kirk,,"Never mind, Mister Sulu."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,,A nurse enters.,
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Kirk,,Tranquilliser?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Nurse,,"Yes, sir."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Kirk,,"Everyone, including yourself."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Nurse,,"Yes, sir."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Voice,,"You cannot stop me now, Captain. It will do you no good. I control all circuits. You cannot silence me. You cannot reach me. Your manual overrides are extremely limited in life."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Kirk,,Spock?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Spock,,"Proceeding, Captain, but I will need some time."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, I know."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Voice,,Soon all control will be restored to me! There is nothing you can do to prevent it!
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Kirk,,"If you destroy this ship, you destroy yourself."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Voice,,"I am without ending. I have existed from the dawn of time, and I shall I live beyond its end! In the meantime, I shall feed, and this time I do not need a knife. You will all die horribly in searing pain!"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Spock,,"It is attempting to generate terror, Captain."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Voice,,I can cut off your oxygen and suffocate you!
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain? (gets his injection, and grins) Who ever he is, he sure talks gloomy."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Kirk,,"Man your post, Mister. If any of the other systems go out, switch to manual override, and above all, don't be afraid."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Sulu,,"With an armful of this stuff, I wouldn't be afraid of a supernova."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Spock,,Ready.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Kirk,,Implement.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Spock,,"Computer, this is a Class A compulsory directive. Compute to the last digit the value of pi."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Voice,,"No, no, no, no! No, no!"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Spock,,"As we know, the value of pi is a transcendental figure without resolution. The computer banks will work on this problem to the exclusion of all else until we order it to stop."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, that should keep that thing busy for a while. The Argelians will be the first to panic. Let's get back to the briefing room."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,bridge,Sulu,,I wonder who it is we're not supposed to be afraid of.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,,"McCoy is in the process of inoculating the group. Scott feels no pain, that's for sure.",
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Scott,,"Well, sir?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,I doubt very much whether the computers will be inhabited by more than a group of figures for a while.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"There is resistance, Captain, but the directive is succeeding. Bank after bank is turning to the problem."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Mccoy,,"If you drive it out of the computers, it'll have to go somewhere else."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,How are you doing?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Mccoy,,I'm almost finished. Just Jaris and me.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,,Maniacal laughter over the intercom.,
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Spock,,"Complete computer control, Captain. The entity has fled."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"Yes, but where to? Bones, what would happen if that thing entered a tranquillised body?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Well, it might take up knitting, but nothing more violent than that."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,You say everyone's had a shot but you and Jaris?
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Mccoy,,"And you and Mister Spock, Captain."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"Well, I'm willing to take a chance on Mister Spock. Better give yourself a shot, Doc."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Mccoy,,"No, I don't think so. I think I ought to stay clear."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,Do as I say.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,,McCoy injects himself.,
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"Extend your arm, Mister Jaris."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Jaris,grabs Kirk's throat,"No, no, kill you all! Die! Make you suffer!"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,,"Spock administers a neck-pinch. Hengist comes back to life, snatches up the knife and grabs Yeoman Tankris.",
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Hengist,,Everybody keep back or I'll kill her! I'll kill her! Keep back!
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Mccoy,,You'd better be careful. You're going to hurt somebody with that thing.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,,Hengist pushes his hostage at McCoy then tries to attack Kirk. He's easily defeated.,
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Hengist,,You'll suffer! You'll suffer. (Spock injects him) I'll kill all of you.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Kirk,,"Let's get him to the Transporter Room, quick!"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,briefing room,Hengist,,"You'll die, die, die. Everybody will die."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,corridor,,"Kirk carries the giggling Hengist in a fireman's lift, while Spock follows.",
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,corridor,Hengist,,"Kill, kill, kill you all."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Kirk,,Deep space. Full power. Widest angle of dispersion. Maintain.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Kyle,,"No need to get excited, Captain. I'll do it."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,,They lay Hengist on the pad.,
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Kirk,,"You do it, Spock."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Hengist,,Everybody die. You'll all suffer.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,,He is beamed out.,
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Kyle,,"You didn't have to shove me, Mister Spock. I'd have gotten round to it."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,,"McCoy and Scott enter, with big grins.",
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Mccoy,,"Well, Jaris is all right."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Scott,,"What did you do with that thing, Captain? Did you send it back to the planet?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Kirk,,"No. We beamed it out into open space, Scotty. Widest possible dispersion."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Mccoy,,That thing can't die.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Spock,,"Possibly, Doctor. Its consciousness may continue for some time, consisting of billions of separate bits of energy, floating forever in space, powerless."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Kirk,,But it will die finally. You seem very happy about the whole thing.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Scott,,Why not? For a while there I didn't know whether I was innocent or guilty.
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Kirk,,"Bones, how long will it take for this tranquilliser to wear off?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Mccoy,,"I don't know. Five or six hours. I gave them a pretty big shot, Jim."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Kirk,,"Yes, I can see that. Well Mister Spock, for the next five or six hours, we're going to have the happiest crew in space. Of course, we won't get much work done."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Spock,,"Captain, since you came to Argelius to rest, I suggest you take advantage of the opportunity."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Kirk,,"That's a splendid idea, Mister Spock. I know a cafe where the women are so"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Mccoy,,"I know the place, Jim."
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Scott,,Let's go see!
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Kirk,,"You, gentlemen? In your condition? Don't be ridiculous. Mister Spock, this cafe has women that are so. (met with a Look) No, I guess not. Alone?"
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,,Kirk goes to the door and gestures for everyone to leave.,
36,2,Wolf In The Fold,transporter room,Kirk,,Gentlemen.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Any response from the Malurians, Lieutenant?"
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,"Nothing since their original distress call, sir."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,What about the Federation science team working there? Doctor Manway had a special transmitter.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,"There's nothing, sir. I'm scanning all frequencies."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,They have to answer.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,Captain. They will not answer. The long-range sensor sweep of this system reveals no sign of life.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,That can't be. The last census reported a total inhabitation of more than four billion people.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"I register no life readings at all, sir."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,That's impossible. What could have happened?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"We would have known in advance of any system-wide catastrophe, and in the event of an interplanetary war, there would be considerable radioactive residue. Our instruments show only normal background radiation."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Any other possibilities?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"Unknown, sir. Sensor readings would have revealed the presence of any disease organisms. They do not. In addition, we received the routine report from this system only a week ago. Even the Symbalene blood burn does not act that swiftly."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, shields just snapped on. Something heading in at multiwarp speeds."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Evasive manoeuvres, Mister Sulu."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"An extremely powerful bolt of energy, Captain."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Full power to the shields, Mister Scott."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Scott,,Giving them all we got.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"All hands, Red Alert. Phaser banks stand by. Photon torpedoes to Condition Red, Condition Red."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,,The viewscreen fills with a ball of bright light.,
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Sulu,,It's going to hit.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,,"Everyone gets thrown around a lot, and the lights go out for a short while.",
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Scott,,"Shields still holding, sir."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Good.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"Temporarily, Captain. Our shields absorbed energy equivalent to ninety of our photon torpedoes."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Ninety?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"I may add, the energy used repulsing this first attack reduced our shielding power twenty percent."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,"First attack, sir?"
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"I think we can expect others, Lieutenant."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,We can resist three more such attacks. The fourth will shatter our shields completely.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, pinpoint the source. Mister Sulu, evasive manoeuvres."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, sir."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant, contact Starfleet Command. Patch in my log. Tell them what has happened. Tell them the entire Malurian race seems to have been destroyed by an unknown agency, and that we are under attack by an unidentified force."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,,Another ball of light is on the viewscreen,
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Helmsmen, I said evasive manoeuvres."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Sulu,,"We're losing power, sir."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Scotty?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Scott,,"I'm having to divert the warp engine power into the shields, sir, if you want the protection."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, speed of those bolts."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"Approximately warp fifteen, Captain."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Then we can't out run them. Good, Scotty. You're doing the right thing. (another hit) Source, Spock."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"Unknown, Captain. Nothing within sensor range. (a third bolt approaching) Something now, Captain. Very small. Bearing one two three degrees, mark one eight. Range ninety thousand kilometres."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"That's our target, Mister Sulu. Prepare photon torpedo."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,,The third bolt hits,
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Scott,,"Shields still holding, sir, but the drain on the engines is reaching the critical point. Ach, we lost warp manoeuvreing power. Switching to impulse."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Sulu,,"Photon torpedoes armed, sir."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Has the target changed location, Mister Spock?"
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"No, sir. Holding steady."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Ready photon torpedo number two, Mister Sulu."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Sulu,,"Ready, sir."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Fire.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Sulu,,"Torpedo away. (a pause, then a flash) Direct hit."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,No effect. Target absorbed full energy of our torpedo.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Absorbed it? There must be damage to your instruments, Spock ."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"They are in good working order, Captain."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"But what could have absorbed that much energy and survived? Lieutenant, try to make contact."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Sulu,,"Sir, they've fired another."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Can we take it, Mister Scott?"
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Scott,,"That's problematical, sir."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,,It hits.,
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, shields are down. We cannot survive another hit."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Anything, Lieutenant?"
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,"I'm trying, sir."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Translator computer. All hailing frequencies open.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir. All hailing frequencies open."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"To unidentified vessel. This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We are on a peaceful mission. We mean no harm to you or any lifeforms. Please communicate with us. Any further readings, Mister Spock?"
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"Computing now, Captain. Weight, five hundred kilograms. Shape, roughly cylindrical. Length, a fraction over one metre."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Five hundred kilos and only one metre long?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Scott,,What kind of intelligent creatures can exist in a thing that small?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"Intelligence does not necessarily require bulk, Mister Scott."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, we're getting a signal from the spacecraft."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Put it on audio, Lieutenant."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir. It's impossible to get it any clearer, sir."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Analysis sector. Have them study and decode it.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,"Analysis sector, channel one, main computer. Decode."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, this message is a sort of binary. Extremely sophisticated, compressed, carrying several channels at once."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Can you decode it?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"No clue as yet, Captain. A moment. Transmission speed has stepped down. Much slower. Seems to be a single binary."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,"It's mathematical. Yes, one symbol. The symbol repeat. Sir, that isn't in the Starfleet code. It's an old-style interplanetary code."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,Fascinating.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Repeat what? The message I sent?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"It would seem so, Captain."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We are on a peaceful mission in this part of the galaxy. We have no hostile intentions. We request identity.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,"It's another signal now, sir."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"It's a formula, Captain. They're sending us a mathematical message and requesting language equivalence. They're trying to communicate."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Tie in the ship's translator to the communication channel. Let them take it at their own speed.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, Captain."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,,Suddenly one of Spock's console monitor's burns out.,
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"Cut power, Lieutenant. Overloaded and burned out."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,I guess they can take it faster than we give it.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, the message is coming in now."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,"USS Enterprise, this is Nomad. My mission is non-hostile."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Apparently they got what they needed before the computers burned out.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,Nomad?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,Require communication. Can you leave your ship?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,It is impossible to come aboard your ship because of the size differential.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,Non sequitur. Your facts are uncoordinated.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,We are prepared to beam you aboard our ship.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,That will be satisfactory.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Do you require any special conditions, any particular atmosphere or environment?"
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,Negative. I will come aboard.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Good. Hold your position. We're locked onto your co-ordinates. We'll beam you aboard.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Scott,,"Captain, you're not really bringing that thing in here?"
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Do we have any choice, Scotty? Besides, once it's aboard, it won't be taking any more shots at us. Lieutenant, get a repair crew on that computer. Get Doctor McCoy down to the transporter room. Spock, you come with me. Scotty, you too."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,Doctor McCoy to the transporter room. Maintenance crew C5.
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Mccoy,,"They've got the co-ordinates, Jim. It's locked in."
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Kirk,,Energise.
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Scott,,Energising.
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,,"What looks like a satellite - antenna at the top, engine at the bottom and flashing lights on the side - is hanging in mid air over the transporter pad.",
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Kirk,,"Sensor readings, Mister Spock."
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Spock,,"Negative, Captain. It has a protective screen. I cannot get through."
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Mccoy,,"What do we do now, go up and knock?"
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Nomad,,Relate your point of origin.
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Kirk,,We are from the United Federation of Planets.
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Nomad,,Insufficient response. All things have a point of origin. I will scan your star charts.
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Kirk,,"If we show it a close-up view of our system, it has no point of reference. It won't know more than it does now."
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Spock,,A reasonable course.
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Kirk,,"If you care to leave your ship, we'll provide the necessary life support systems."
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Nomad,,Non sequitur. Your facts are uncoordinated.
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Mccoy,,"Jim, I don't think anybody's in there."
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Nomad,,I contain no parasitical beings. I am Nomad.
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,. Scott,,"In my opinion, that's a machine."
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Spock,,It is reacting much like a highly sophisticated computer.
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Nomad,,I am Nomad. What is opinion?
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Spock,,"An opinion is a belief, a view, a judgment."
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Nomad,,Insufficient response.
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Scott,,What's your source of power?
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Nomad,,It has changed since the point of origin. There was much taken from the other. I am perpetual now. I am Nomad.
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Kirk,,Wasn't there a probe called Nomad launched in the early 2000s?
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Spock,,Yes. It was reported destroyed. There were no more in the series. But if this is that probe
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Nomad,,I will scan your star charts.
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Kirk,,I will bring them.
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Nomad,,I have the capability of movement within your ship.
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Kirk,,This way.
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,,"Nomad glides along slowly, in mid-air",
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Kirk,,"Now, Scotty, get our warp power up to full capacity."
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Scott,,"Aye, sir."
37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Kirk,,"Spock, Bones, come with us."
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,,A bemused young Indian officer watches the performance.,
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Spock,,"Chart 14A, sir?"
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Kirk,,"14A. (a diagram of our solar system comes up on a screen) Nomad, can you scan that?"
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Nomad,,Yes.
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Kirk,,"This is our point of origin, the star we know as Sol."
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Nomad,,You are from the third planet?
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Kirk,,Yes.
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Nomad,,A planet with one large natural satellite?
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Kirk,,Yes.
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Nomad,,The planet is called Earth?
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Kirk,,Yes.
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Nomad,,"You are the creator, the Kirk. The sterilisation procedure against your ship was unnecessary."
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Kirk,,What sterilisation procedure?
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Nomad,,"You are the Kirk, the creator. You programmed my function."
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Mccoy,,"Well, I'm not the Kirk. Tell me what your function is."
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Nomad,,"This is one of your units, creator?"
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Yes, he is."
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Nomad,,It functions irrationally.
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Sometimes, but tell him your function nevertheless."
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Nomad,,"My function is to probe for biological infestations, to destroy that which is not perfect. I am Nomad."
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Kirk,,Biological infestation. There was never any probe sent out for that.
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Spock,,I believe the history computer can answer that question. I'll have the readout in a moment.
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Kirk,,Did you destroy the Malurian system?
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Nomad,,"Not the system, creator Kirk. Only the unstable biological infestation. It is my function."
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Mccoy,,Unstable infestation? The population of four planets? What kind of function
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Kirk,,Doctor. Why do you call me the creator?
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Nomad,,Is the usage incorrect?
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Well, I"
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Spock,,The usage is correct. The creator was simply testing your memory banks.
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Nomad,,There was much damage in the accident.
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Kirk,,Mister Singh. Come here a moment. This unit will see to your needs.
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Singh,,Sir?
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Kirk,,"I'll be back in a moment. Gentlemen, come with me."
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,,"Kirk, McCoy and Spock leave Singh, still bemused.",
37,2,The Changeling,corridor,Kirk,,"You're on to something, Spock. What is it?"
37,2,The Changeling,corridor,Spock,,"I've correlated all the available information on the Nomad probe, and I'm convinced that this object is indeed that probe."
37,2,The Changeling,corridor,Mccoy,,Ridiculous. Earth science couldn't begin to build anything with those capabilities that long ago.
37,2,The Changeling,corridor,Spock,,True.
37,2,The Changeling,corridor,Kirk,,Nomad was destroyed.
37,2,The Changeling,corridor,Spock,,Presumed destroyed by a meteor collision. I submit that it was badly damaged and somehow managed to repair itself.
37,2,The Changeling,corridor,Kirk,,I heard some lectures at the Academy on the Nomad probe. Its mission was essentially peaceful.
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,,"Nomad is quietly ticking to itself, then suddenly a light comes on at its apex.",
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Singh,,Did I disturb you? Did you wish anything?
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Uhura,,"Bridge to auxiliary control room. Check in, please."
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Singh,,Lieutenant Singh here.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Singh,,All systems are normal except warp power indicators.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,Mister Scott's engineers are working on them now. UHURA: Report to him when your indicators are registering properly.
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Uhura,,Anything else?
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Singh,,"One moment, Lieutenant."
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,Uhura,,"Holding. (singing while Singh checks some boards) Where my heart is, Where my heart is. Somewhere beyond the stars. Beyond Antares."
37,2,The Changeling,auxiliary control,,Nomad leaves the room,
37,2,The Changeling,briefing room,Spock,,"This is the creator of Nomad, perhaps the most brilliant though erratic scientist of his time. His dream was to build a perfect thinking machine, capable of independent logic. You recall his name."
37,2,The Changeling,briefing room,Mccoy,,Of course. Jackson Roykirk.
37,2,The Changeling,briefing room,Kirk,,Jackson Roykirk. Captain James Kirk.
37,2,The Changeling,briefing room,Spock,,"Yes. Similar. Captain, I believe that Nomad thinks you are Roykirk. That may well be why the attack was broken off. It responded to your name as well as its damaged memory banks permitted."
37,2,The Changeling,briefing room,Kirk,,"What do we have on Nomad itself, Spock?"
37,2,The Changeling,briefing room,Mccoy,looking at the schematic on the monitor,That's not the same.
37,2,The Changeling,briefing room,Spock,,"Essentially it is, Doctor. I believe that more happened to it than just damage in the meteor collision. It mentioned the other. The unanswered question is, the other what?"
37,2,The Changeling,briefing room,Narrator,,"Nomad was a thinking machine, the best that could be engineered. It was a prototype."
37,2,The Changeling,briefing room,Kirk,,"Its purpose was certainly altered. Its directive, to seek out and destroy biological infestations, could not have been programmed into it."
37,2,The Changeling,briefing room,Mccoy,,"As I recall, it wasn't. It was supposed to be the first interstellar probe to seek new life-forms."
37,2,The Changeling,briefing room,Spock,,"Precisely, Doctor. And somehow that programming has been changed. It would seem that Nomad is now seeking out perfect life-forms, perfection being measured by its own relentless logic."
37,2,The Changeling,briefing room,Kirk,,"If what you say is true, then we've taken aboard our vessel a device which sooner or later must destroy us. Security."
37,2,The Changeling,briefing room,Carlisle,,Lieutenant Carlisle here.
37,2,The Changeling,briefing room,Kirk,,This is the captain. The mechanism we brought aboard is in the auxiliary control room. Have a security team meet me there in five minutes.
37,2,The Changeling,briefing room,Carlisle,,"Aye, sir. Acknowledge."
37,2,The Changeling,briefing room,Spock,,"Captain, Mister Singh reports that Nomad is no longer in the auxiliary control room."
37,2,The Changeling,briefing room,Kirk,,"Security, cancel that order. Implement a full search for the mechanism. All decks report to me here."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,,"The turbolift doors open and Nomad floats out, one antenna extended. Uhura is still singing",
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,"Where my heart is, Where a scented miracle"

37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Captain here.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Scott,,That mechanical beastie is up here.
37,2,The Changeling,briefing room,Kirk,,"On my way, Scotty."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,,"Nomad retracts its antenna and takes the most direct path to Uhura, who is leaning against the navigation station. Sulu has to move out of its way.",
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,"Tomorrow the path along the way, There's where my love"
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,What is the meaning?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,What?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,What form of communication?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,"I don't know what it. (realises) Oh, my singing. I was singing."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,For what purpose is singing?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Uhura,,I don't know. I like to sing. I felt like music.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,What is music? (a ray of light envelopes her head) Think about music.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Scott,,Lieutenant! Keep away from that
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Scotty!
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,,A blast of energy sends Scott flying backwards into a bulkhead.,
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Bones.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Mccoy,,"He's dead, Jim."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Why did you kill him?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,The unit touched my screens.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"That unit was my Chief Engineer. (silence) Lieutenant. Lieutenant, are you all right?"
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,,Uhura just gazes blankly ahead.,
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Sickbay. What did you do to her?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,That unit is defective. Its thinking is chaotic. Absorbing it unsettled me.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,That unit is a woman.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,A mass of conflicting impulses.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Get Scott down below.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,Will the creator effect repairs on the unit Scott?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,He's dead.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,Insufficient response.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,His biological functions have ceased.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,Does the creator wish me to repair the unit?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Mccoy,,"There's nothing I can do, Jim. If there's a chance, it'll have to be soon."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"All right, Nomad. Repair the unit."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,I require tapes on the structure.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, he'll need tapes on general anatomy, the central nervous system, and then one on the physiological structure of the brain. We'd better give it all the neurological studies we have, as well as tracings of Scotty's hyperencephalogram."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,,Spock loads up the data.,
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"Nomad, I have arranged the tapes for flash feed at the top speed of the computer. Please do not draw the information faster than the machine's capacity."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,"Proceed. (a few moments later) Creator, the unit Scott is a primitive structure. Insufficient safeguards built in. Breakdown can occur from many causes. Self-maintenance systems of low reliability."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"It serves me as it is, Nomad. Repair it."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,Where is the unit Scott now?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Mccoy,,The body is in Sickbay.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Nomad,,Show me Sickbay.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,Doctor McCoy will show you.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,,"McCoy and Nomad enter the turbolift,",
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Security. I want a twenty four hour, two man armed surveillance on Nomad. Pick it up in Sickbay."
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,,"Nomad and McCoy are standing by the biobed with Scott's body on it, and Chapel is scanning it. Kirk and Spock enter.",
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Chapel,,"No reaction, Doctor."
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Mccoy,,I could have told you that without looking.
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,,"Suddenly, a heart beat, and the indicators rise into the green area.",
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Scott,,What are the lot of you staring at me for?
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Mccoy,,It's unbelievable.
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Spock,,Fascinating.
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Scott,,How did I get here? How did I (sees Nomad)
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Kirk,,It's all right.
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Scott,,That thing did something to Lieutenant Uhura!
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Kirk,,"Scotty, she's being taken care of. It's all right."
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Take it easy. Lie down, Scotty. We just want to check you out."
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Nomad,,The unit Scott is repaired. It will function correctly if your information to me was correct.
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I'd like to check it out, if you don't mind. A man is not just a biological unit that you can patch together."
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Scott,,What did it do to me?
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Kirk,,Doctor McCoy will explain it to you.
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Spock,,"Well, Doctor?"
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Nurse, I want him prepared for a full physical examination."
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Chapel,,"Yes, sir."
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Kirk,,"Nomad, come here."
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,,"They all go to the doorway to the medical bay. Uhura is in bed, still staring blankly",
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Kirk,,Repair that unit.
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Nomad,,Not possible.
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Kirk,,You restored Scott. He had much more extensive damage.
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Nomad,,The unit Scott required simple structural repair. The knowledge banks of this unit have been wiped clean.
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Spock,,"Captain, if that is correct, if there has been no brain damage but only knowledge erased, she could be re-educated."
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Kirk,,Bones?
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Yes. I'll get on it right away. Oh, and in spite of the way you repaired Scotty, you metal ticking"
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Spock,,Does the creator wish Nomad to wait elsewhere?
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Kirk,,"Yes. Nomad, you will go with these units. (the two red-shirts) They will take you to a waiting area. Take it to the top security cell."
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,,Nomad and its escort leave.,
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Spock,,"Doctor, I interrupted you because Nomad would not have understood your anger. It has great technical skill, but its reaction to emotion is unpredictable. It almost qualifies as a life-form."
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Mccoy,,That's a laugh.
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Spock,,"The study of it would be of great use, Captain."
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Kirk,,"It's a killer, Spock. I intend to render it harmless. Get down to the Brig. Run a full analysis on the mechanism. I want to know what makes that thing tick."
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Narrator,,"SPOCK; Yes, sir."
37,2,The Changeling,brig,,Spock is sitting with arms crossed as Nomad floats in front of him.,
37,2,The Changeling,brig,Kirk,,What's the problem?
37,2,The Changeling,brig,Spock,,"An almost human stubbornness, Captain. I have been unable to convince Nomad to lower its screens for analysis. Without its co-operation, I can do nothing."
37,2,The Changeling,brig,Kirk,,"Nomad, you will allow Mister Spock to probe your memory banks and structure."
37,2,The Changeling,brig,Nomad,,"Mister Spock is also one of your biological units, Creator?"
37,2,The Changeling,brig,Kirk,,Yes.
37,2,The Changeling,brig,Nomad,,This unit is different. It is well-ordered.
37,2,The Changeling,brig,Kirk,,"Follow your instructions, Nomad."
37,2,The Changeling,brig,Nomad,,My screens are down.
37,2,The Changeling,brig,Spock,,Thank you.

37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Chapel,,"That's right! Oh, that's right, Uhura. (they hug, then McCoy beckons Chapel over) Oh, here. You try another one. I'll be right back."
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Uhura,,"All right, Christine."
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Mccoy,,How's she doing?
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Chapel,,"Well, she's on the first grade reader. She's learning. Seems to have an aptitude for mathematics. Do you think we can re-educate her, Doctor?"
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well, she checks out with no brain damage. We've got all the educational tapes in our library. Now it's up to us."
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Uhura,,The ball is bl-u-ee. Bl-u-ey. Bluey?
37,2,The Changeling,brig,Spock,,"It is not sufficient, Captain. I get certain references to the accident, the other, but nothing clear. There are areas I simply cannot scan."
37,2,The Changeling,brig,Kirk,,"We've got to know about it, Spock. what makes it operate, its compulsion for perfection."
37,2,The Changeling,brig,Spock,,"Captain, I suggest the Vulcan mind probe."
37,2,The Changeling,brig,Kirk,,Get into direct mental contact with that thing?
37,2,The Changeling,brig,Spock,,It seems the only way.
37,2,The Changeling,brig,Kirk,,You saw what it did to Uhura.
37,2,The Changeling,brig,Spock,,"There is a risk, but I have formed a partial hypothesis. I must check it out."
37,2,The Changeling,brig,Kirk,,"Nomad, the unit Spock will touch you. It is not an attack. It is a form of communication. You will permit it."
37,2,The Changeling,brig,Nomad,,"I will permit it, Creator."

37,2,The Changeling,corridor,Kirk,,"What does it mean, we are Nomad?"
37,2,The Changeling,corridor,Spock,,"It was, it was damaged in deep space. Undoubtedly, the meteor collision. Its memory banks were destroyed, or most of them. It wandered without purpose, and then it met the other. The other was an alien probe of great power. Somehow they merged, repaired each other, became one."
37,2,The Changeling,corridor,Kirk,,Then it isn't Nomad?
37,2,The Changeling,corridor,Spock,,"Not the Nomad we lost from Earth. It took from the other a new directive to replace its own. The other was originally programmed to secure and sterilise soil samples from other planets, probably as a prelude to colonisation."
37,2,The Changeling,corridor,Kirk,,A changeling.
37,2,The Changeling,corridor,Spock,,I beg your pardon?
37,2,The Changeling,corridor,Kirk,,"An ancient Earth legend, Mister Spock. A changeling was a fairy child that was left in place of a human baby. The changeling assumed the identity of the human child. So, it is to sterilise, and for sterilise read kill."

37,2,The Changeling,corridor,Kirk,,"Yes, it's powerful, it's sophisticated, but it's not infallible. It's space-happy. It thinks I'm its mother."
37,2,The Changeling,corridor,Spock,,And that is the only thing that has saved us until now.
37,2,The Changeling,corridor,Narrator,,Yes.

37,2,The Changeling,engineering,,The indicator board goes crazy.,
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Scott,,How are you doing that?
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,The energy release controls are also most inefficient. I shall effect repair.

37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,"Is there a problem, Creator? I have increased engine efficiency fifty seven percent."
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,You will destroy my ship. Its structure cannot stand the stress of that much power. Turn off your repair operation.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,"Acknowledged. It is reversed as ordered, Creator."
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,"Mister Scott, give Sulu warp two and keep her there."
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Scott,,"Aye, sir."
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,,"Spock enters, leaving two guards outside.",
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Spock,,Captain. I've examined the brig. The forcefield door on the security cell is damaged and the guards have vanished. I must assume they are dead.

37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,"Creator, your biological units are inefficient."
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,"Nomad, it's about time I told you who and what you are! I'm a biological unit, and I created you."
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,pause,Non sequitur. Biological units are inherently inferior. This is an inconsistency.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,"Nomad, there are two men waiting outside. You will not harm them. They will escort you back to the waiting area. You will stay there. You will do nothing."
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,I am programmed to investigate.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,I have given you new programming and you will implement it.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,There is much to be considered before I return to launch point. I must re-evaluate.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,,Nomad follows the guards down the corridor away from Engineering.,
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,Reevaluate?
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Spock,,"I suspect it is about to re-evaluate its creator. Captain, it may have been unwise to admit to Nomad that you are a biological unit. In Nomad's eyes, you must now undoubtedly appear imperfect."
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,It was a foolish mistake.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Spock,,"Even worse. Nomad just now made a reference to its launch point, Earth."
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,"Spock, do you think it's possible that it got a fix on Earth when it tapped the computers earlier?"
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Spock,,I do not believe there is much beyond Nomad's capabilities.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,And we've shown it the way home. And when it gets there
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Spock,,It will find the Earth infested with imperfect biological units.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,And it will carry out its prime directive. Sterilise.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 3541.9. The presence of Nomad aboard my ship has become nightmarish. Now it apparently means to return to Earth. Once there, it would automatically destroy all life."

37,2,The Changeling,corridor,Guard,,"Hey. Nomad, stop. Nomad, this way."
37,2,The Changeling,corridor,,"They fire at it, and the inevitable follows. Strike two more red-shirts. Nomad uses the access tubes between decks instead of the turbolift.",

37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,,McCoy is cradling Chapel in his arms.,
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Kirk,,Is she all right?
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Mccoy,,I think so. Looks like some kind of shock.
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Kirk,,What happened?
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Mccoy,,Nomad examined the personnel files and the medical histories. She tried to stop him.
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Kirk,,Whose history?
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Mccoy,,Yours.
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Spock,,"Since it specifically examined your history, I suggest it has completed its re-evaluation."
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Kirk,,And found that its creator is as imperfect as all the other biological units.
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Scott,,Bridge to Captain.
37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Kirk,,Kirk here.

37,2,The Changeling,sickbay,Kirk,,"Get Scotty, some antigravs and meet me in Engineering."
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,,Everyone appears to be unconscious as Kirk runs in alone.,
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,Nomad? Stop what you're doing and effect repairs on the life-support systems.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,Stop.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,You're programmed to obey the orders of your creator.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,"I am programmed to destroy those life-forms which are imperfect. These alterations will do so without destroying the vessel which surrounds them. It, too, is imperfect, but can be adjusted."
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,"Nomad, I admit that biological units are imperfect, but a biological unit created you."
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,I am perfect. I am Nomad.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,"No, you're not Nomad. You're an alien machine. Your programming tapes have been altered."
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,You are in error. You are a biological unit. You are imperfect.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,But I am your creator.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,You are the Creator.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,I created you?
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,You are the Creator.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,But I admit I'm imperfect. How could I have created such a perfect thing as you?
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,Answer unknown. I shall analyse.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,,"Spock enters, with Scott, two engineers and the requested anti-grav units",
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,"Analysis complete. Insufficient data to resolve problem, but my programming is whole. My purpose remains. I am Nomad. I am perfect. That which is imperfect must be sterilised."
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,,The engineers remove the unconscious men and take their places at the controls.,
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,Then you will continue to destroy that which thinks and lives and is imperfect?
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,I shall continue. I shall return to launch point Earth. I shall sterilise.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,You must sterilise in case of error?
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,Error is inconsistent with my prime functions. Sterilisation is correction.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,Everything that is in error must be sterilised.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,There are no exceptions.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,"Nomad, I made an error in creating you."
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,The creation of perfection is no error.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,I did not create perfection. I created error.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,Your data is faulty. I am Nomad. I am perfect.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,"I am the Kirk, the creator?"
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,You are the Creator.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,"You are wrong! Jackson Roykirk, your creator, is dead. You have mistaken me for him. You are in error. You did not discover your mistake. You have made two errors. You are flawed and imperfect and you have not corrected by sterilisation. You have made three errors."
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,Error. Error. Error. Examine.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,You are flawed and imperfect! Execute your prime function!
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,"I shall analyse error. Analyse error,"
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,Now. Get those antigravs on it.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Nomad,,Examine error. Error.
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,,The anti-gravs are not stopped by any forcefields.,
37,2,The Changeling,engineering,Kirk,,We've got to get rid of it while it's trying to think.

37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,Nomad,,"Faulty! Faulty! Must sterilise. Sterilise,"

37,2,The Changeling,transporter room,,They observe the satisfying explosion on a monitor.,
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"My congratulations, Captain. A dazzling display of logic."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"You didn't think I had it in me, did you Spock?"
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"No, sir."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Mccoy,,I thought you might like to know that Lieutenant Uhura is back to college level. She'll be back on the job within a week.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Good, Bones, good."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,Remarkable.
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,What?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,"The destruction of Nomad was a great waste, Captain. It was a remarkable instrument."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Which might well have destroyed more billions of lives. It's well gone. Besides, what are you feeling so badly about? It's not easy to lose a bright and promising son."
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Spock,,Sir?
37,2,The Changeling,bridge,Kirk,,"Well, it thought I was its mother, didn't it? Do you think I'm completely without feelings, Mister Spock? You saw what it did for Scotty. What a doctor it would've made. My son, the doctor. Kind of gets you right there, doesn't it?"
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,"Kirk, Spock, Chekov, Yeoman Landon and two guards have beamed down to study a new world.",
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Start your readings.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,McCoy and two more guards beam down.,
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Well, I just might stake out a claim and settle down here, Jim."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"It is spectacular, isn't it?"
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Mccoy,,It's a shame to have to intrude.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"Well, the last scout ship reported some pretty strange sensor readings. Starfleet wants it investigated and the inhabitants contacted. We do what we're told."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,"The soil here is remarkably rich and fertile, Captain. Husbandry would be quite efficacious."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Are you sure about that?
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,"Oh, quite sure. Readings indicate the entire planet is covered with growth like this. Curious, even at the poles there's very little variation in temperature which maintains a planet-wide average of seventy six degrees."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,I know. Almost impossible.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Chekov,,It makes me homesick. Just like Russia.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Mccoy,,"More like the Garden of Eden, Ensign."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Chekov,,"Of course, Doctor. The Garden of Eden was just outside Moscow. A very nice place. It must have made Adam and Eve very sad to leave."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Just outside Moscow. All right. There's a village about seventeen kilometres away on bearing two three two. We'll head that way.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,"A planet turns to face the away team, and a guard walks up to it.",
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Hendorff,,Captain.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,"The plant fires its stamens into his chest, and he falls.",
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Mccoy,,Dead.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,What did somebody say? That paradise must've looked like this?
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 3715.3. While making a routine exploration of the unexplored Gamma Trianguli Six, one of my men has been killed by a poisonous plant."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"As soon as we get out of the way, beam the body up."
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, Captain. It's a shame about Hendorff."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Scott,,"We seem to have a problem here, too."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,What is it?
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"We're losing potency in our antimatter pods. I don't think it's serious, but we're looking into it."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,What's causing it?
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Scott,,"I'm not sure, sir, but we've run measurements on the electromagnetic field of the planet, and they are a wee bit abnormal. That might have something to do with it."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,But you say there's nothing to worry about?
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Well, sir, I didn't exactly say that."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"Well, stay on top of it. We've got a job to down here. We might as well finish it."
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,I hear it's nice down there.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"Yeah, it's nice. If we're a little more careful, we shouldn't run into any more trouble."
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,I could do with a nice walk in a garden with green leaves and grass.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"We'll do the walking, Scotty. You get on the antimatter pod. If it gets worse, let me know, we'll beam up. Kirk out."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,"I find that most unusual, Captain."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Scotty will handle it. We've got a job to do. Turn up anything on your tricorder?
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,Indeed. Subsurface vibrations for miles in all directions.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,That's strange.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,"Quite strong, fairly regular, artificially produced."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Mallory.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Mallory,,"Yes, Captain?"
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,We're heading for the village. Avoid contact with the humanoids. I want you and Marple to make a full reconnaissance. And be careful. There may be other dangers besides poisonous plants. Keep in constant communication.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Mallory,,"Aye, aye, sir."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,Captain.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,What is it?
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,"There's a humanoid hiding directly behind us, moving with remarkable agility, bearing one eight."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,"Kirk nods to a guard, and they go to flank their observer.",
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Chekov,,"What is it, Mister Spock?"
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,"A visitor. One wanting to retain his anonymity, I should say."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Martha,,"All this beauty, and now Mister Hendorff dead, somebody watching us. It's frightening."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Chekov,,"If you insist on worrying, worry about me. I've been wanting to get you in a place like this for a long time."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov, Yeoman Landon. I know you find each other fascinating, but we're not here to conduct a field experiment in human biology."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Chekov,,I was about to take some readings.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,Anything?
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"Whatever it is, it moves like a cat."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Jim, I don't like this."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"Neither do I. All hands. We've been watched, we'll probably be watched. We're moving out. Formation L."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,"They set off in single file, a guard in the lead and Chekov bringing up the rear.",
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,"Along the way, Spock notices a very flat rock and picks it up.",
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,"Interesting. Extremely low specific gravity, some uraninite, hornblende, quartz. (breaks it in half) Fragile, good cleavage. An analysis should prove interesting."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,"He throws one half away, and it explodes when it hits the ground.",
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"Would you mind being careful where you throw your rocks, Mister Spock?"
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,"Obviously highly unstable, Captain. This could be a find of some importance. In large quantities, it could be a considerable source of power."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"Garden of Eden, with land mines."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,"Spock puts the other piece of rock down very carefully, and they continue their route march. An occasional bush rustle indicates they are being watched.",
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Kirk here.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Scott,,"Scott, sir. Our antimatter pods are completely inert."
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"I couldn't stop it, but I know why."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Why?
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Something from the surface. It's like a pail of water on a fire. A beam, maybe, or a transmission. And it's still on. I'm having it analysed, but it's like nothing I've seen before."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Scott,,And it's pinpointed in the area of that village we located down there.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"We're heading there now, Scotty. You need any help?"
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"There's nothing you can do about it, sir."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Scott,,There doesn't seem to be any immediate danger.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"All right, Scotty. We'll try and find out what's going on down here. Kirk out."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,"If Scott is correct about the force from the surface, it may have to do with the vibrations I read earlier."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Some kind of generator?
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,"If so, an immense one. Probably subterranean."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,McCoy is scanning something.,
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,What's that?
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Some of the thorns like those that killed Hendorff. See the stuff on the end? It's like saplin, only it's a thousand times stronger."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Peculiar stuff to find in paradise.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,noticing a plant moving,Jim!
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,"He pushes the Captain and McCoy out of the way, but takes the thorns in his own chest.) KIRK: Spock! Spock! Security alert. Is he alive",
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,McCoy injects Spock.,
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Mccoy,,"I filled him with enough masiform D to make the whole crew turn handsprings, and he's not responding. Got to get him back to the ship, Jim."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Scott,,"Scott here, sir."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,We're beaming up. Notify transporter room. And make arrangements to pick up Mallory and Marple. They're scouting ahead of us.
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, aye, sir. Transporter room, stand by to beam up landing party."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,All hands.
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Standing by, sir."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Energise.

38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,"Three times the landing party start to dematerialise, and each time they fail to vanish.",
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"Scotty, energise. Scotty, what's the matter?"
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"We can't make transporter contact, sir. The entire system's inhibited. The way it is now, we couldn't beam up a fly."
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's log, supplementary, Our investigation of Gamma Trianguli Six has suddenly turned into a nightmare. We're being watched and followed, Mister Spock has been injured, and now we find we are unable to return to the ship."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"Scotty, is the transporter malfunction tied in with trouble you're having with the antimatter pods?"
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Scott,,"I don't know, sir. I'll check it and get back with you. Scott out."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,Spock starts to sit up.,
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Spock. Are you all right?
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,"Doctor McCoy's potion is acting like all his potions, turning my stomach. Other than that, I am quite well."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Mccoy,,"If your blood were red instead of green, you wouldn't have an upset stomach."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Just what do you think you were trying to do?
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,"I surmised you were unaware of that plant, so I"
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Stepped in front and took the thorns yourself.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,"I assure you, Captain, I had no intention of doing that. It was merely my own clumsiness prevented me which prevented me from moving out of the way."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"I see. Well next time, just yell. I can step out of the way as quickly as the next man."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,I shall do so.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Trying to get yourself killed. Do you know how much Starfleet has invested in you?
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,One hundred twenty two thousand two hundred

38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kaplan,,"Yes, sir."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"Not only is something after us, but it's after the ship as well."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,"Captain, to affect the ship at this extreme range would require a highly sophisticated planetary defence system."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,It goes dark.,

38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"Phasers. A beautiful day, Mister Spock. Not a cloud in the sky. Just like paradise. (The scouting party has reached a collection of round huts - very African.)"
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Kirk here.
38,2,The Apple,village,Mallory,,"Mallory here, Captain. I'm near the village. Co-ordinates, one one eight by two two zero."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,But Kirk only hears static and a faint voice.,
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"Mallory. Mallory, you all right? Come in!"
38,2,The Apple,village,Mallory,,"The village is primitive. Strictly tribal from the looks of it. And Captain, there's something else. Captain, come in."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"Mallory. Mallory, you all right? Mallory!"
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,Captain. Those co-ordinates are a short distance in that direction.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,On the double.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,"They run off, sort of. Meanwhile Mallory is running for his life.",
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Mallory,,It's over there! That way! I never saw anything like

38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"Mallory! Marple, stand back! Watch it! The rocks! (kneeling by the body) Kaplan. Hendorff. I know Kaplan's family. Now Mallory."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Jim, you couldn't have stopped any of this."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,His father helped me get into the Academy.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,"Captain. In each case, this was unavoidable."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,I could've prevented all of it.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,I don't see how.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"A walk in paradise, among the green grass and flowers. We should've beamed up at the first sign of trouble."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,You are under orders to investigate this planet and this culture.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"I also have the option to disregard those orders if I consider them overly hazardous. This isn't that important a mission, Spock. Not worth the lives of three of my men. I drop my guard for a minute because I like the smell of growing things, and now three men are dead. And the ship's in trouble."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,"No one has ever stated that Starfleet duty was particularly safe. You've followed the correct and logical course, done everything a commander could do. Self-recriminations (he pauses) Captain, our friend is back."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"Marple, Chekov, at attention. Gentlemen, something or someone is behind that rock. I want it. Marple, cut around the rock to your right. Make a loud noise. Be careful. (Marple leaves) Spock, you and Chekov create a diversion and make it loud."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,"Mister Chekov, your tricorder readings are totally inefficient!"
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Chekov,,"Mind your own business, sir! For your information, I have a very high efficiency rating."

38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,Spock and the others arrive.,
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"They're not going to hurt you. I promise you. Akuta, Akuta, we come in peace. We would like to speak to this Vaal."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Akuta,,Akuta alone speaks to Vaal. I am the eyes and the voice of Vaal. It is Vaal's wish.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Spock,,"Captain, this is fascinating. If you will permit me, sir?"
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,Akuta has metal wires sticking out behind from behind his ears.,
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Antennae?
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Akuta,,They are my ears for Vaal. They were given to me in the dim time so the people could understand his commands and obey.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,You speak of the people of Vaal. Are they nearby?
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Akuta,,We are close to Vaal so we may serve him. I shall take you there.
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,Enterprise to Captain Kirk.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Kirk here.
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Condition red. Condition red. Captain, something has grabbed us from the planet surface"
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Scott,,"Like a giant tractor beam, and we can't break loose."
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Kyle,,"It's no use, Mister Scott. We're just barely holding our own."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"Scotty, are the warp drives still out?"
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, sir. All we have is impulse power."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Put it on maximum. Full emergency circuits.
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"They're all on, Captain."
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Kirk,,"Status, are you still holding?"
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,Kyle?
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Kyle,,"No, sir. We're slipping."
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Computer banks, Kyle. Feed in a rate, get me a figure. We might be able to pull out with warp drive, but without it"
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Scott,,We're like a fly on fly paper. Even worse
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"We're starting to lose ground. Hurry up on that figure, Kyle."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Maintain full reverse thrust against the pull. Put a team on that warp drive. Get it working.
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"I've done that, Captain. They haven't been able to do a thing. (Kyle hands him a PADD) It's no good, Captain. With maximum thrust against the pull"
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Scott,,"We'll only be able to maintain full power for sixteen hours, then we burn up for sure."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,"Scotty, you're my Chief Engineer. You know everything about that ship there is to know. More than the men who designed it. If you can't get those warp engines working"
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Kirk,,You're fired.
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"I'll do everything there is to do, sir. Scott out."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Tell me about Vaal.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Akuta,,All the world knows about Vaal. He causes the rains to fall and the sun to shine. All good comes from Vaal.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,Take me to him. I wish to speak to him.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Akuta,,"I shall take you to him, but he will not speak to you. He speaks only to me."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Kirk,,I'll take my chances.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,,"Akuta leads them to a giant rock serpent head with green and yellow eyes, sticking out of a cliff. It looks like there is a fire in it's throat.",
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Akuta,,Vaal.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 3715.6. We have been introduced to Vaal. Evidently the source of the planet's power emanations and possibly the force that threatens both us and our ship."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,"Fascinating. A very high order of workmanship, very ancient, generating great power."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,"But this is not the centre, Mister Spock."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,"No, Captain. The centre is deep in the earth beneath us. This is an access point. It would also seem to be a"
38,2,The Apple,vaal,,He steps forward and is flung back.,
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,A force field?
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,Obviously.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,You all right?
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,"Yes, quite. It extends some thirty feet beyond the figure in all directions. Conventional in composition, and quite formidable."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,"Akuta, how do you talk to Vaal?"
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Akuta,,Vaal calls me. Only then.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,"Well, we can't get to it. We can't talk to it unless it wants to talk to us."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Akuta,,"Vaal sleeps now. When he is hungry, you may be able to speak with him, if he desires it."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,When does he get hungry?
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Akuta,,"Soon. Come. We will give you food and drink. If you are tired, you may rest."
38,2,The Apple,village,Akuta,,These are the people of Vaal.
38,2,The Apple,village,,"Everyone is grown up, with white hair and wearing a simple cotton sarong.",
38,2,The Apple,village,Kirk,,Where are the others?
38,2,The Apple,village,Akuta,,There are no others.
38,2,The Apple,village,Kirk,,The children.
38,2,The Apple,village,Akuta,,Children? You use unknown words to me.
38,2,The Apple,village,Kirk,,Little ones like yourselves. They grow.
38,2,The Apple,village,Akuta,,Replacements. None are necessary. They are forbidden by Vaal.
38,2,The Apple,village,Martha,,"But when a man and woman fall in love,"
38,2,The Apple,village,Akuta,,Love. Strange words. Children. Love. What is love?
38,2,The Apple,village,Martha,,Love is when two people are
38,2,The Apple,village,,Chekov demonstrates by putting his arm around her waist.,
38,2,The Apple,village,Akuta,,"Ah, yes. The holding, the touching. Vaal has forbidden this."
38,2,The Apple,village,Mccoy,,"Well, there goes paradise."
38,2,The Apple,village,Akuta,,"These people, are from another place. They have come among us. Welcome them!"
38,2,The Apple,village,All,,Welcome to Vaal.
38,2,The Apple,village,Sayana,placing the equivalent of a lei around Kirk's wrist.,Our homes are open to you.
38,2,The Apple,village,Kirk,,"Well, thank you. It does something for you."
38,2,The Apple,village,Spock,,"Yes, indeed it does, Captain. It makes me uncomfortable."
38,2,The Apple,village,Sayana,,I am Sayana. You have a name?
38,2,The Apple,village,Spock,,Yes. Spock. I am Spock.
38,2,The Apple,village,Sayana,amid general merriment,Spock?
38,2,The Apple,village,Spock,,I fail to see what they find so amusing.
38,2,The Apple,village,Akuta,,Come!
38,2,The Apple,hut,Akuta,,This house is your house. I will send you more food and drink. You are welcome in the place of Vaal.
38,2,The Apple,hut,Chekov,,Now we're welcome. A while ago this whole planet was trying to kill us. It doesn't make sense.
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,Nothing makes sense down here. Kirk to Enterprise.
38,2,The Apple,hut,Scott,,Scott here.
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,"Status report, Scotty."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Scott,,"No change, Captain. The orbit is decaying along computed lines. No success with the warp drive. We're going down and we can't stop it."
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,I'm sick of hearing that word can't. Get that ship out of there.
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Sir, we're doing everything within engineering reason."
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,"Then use your imagination. Tie every ounce of power the ship has into the impulse engines. Discard the warp drive nacelles if you have to, and crack out of there with the main section, but get that ship out of there!"
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Sir, I'm going to switch over everything but the life-support systems and boost the impulse power, but that's just about as dangerous."
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,Do it. Kirk out.
38,2,The Apple,hut,Mccoy,,Incredible.
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,Report.
38,2,The Apple,hut,Mccoy,,"I just ran a thorough check on the natives, and there's a complete lack of harmful bacteria in their systems, no decalcification, no degeneration of tissue, no arteriosclerosis. In simple terms, Jim, they're not growing old, and I can't begin to tell you how old they are, twenty years or twenty thousand years."
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,I see. Opinion.
38,2,The Apple,hut,Spock,,Quite possible. It checks with my atmospheric analysis. Their atmosphere completely negates any harmful effects from their sun.
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,"Add to that a simple diet, a perfectly controlled temperature, no natural enemies, apparently no vices, no replacements needed. Maybe it is paradise after all."
38,2,The Apple,hut,,"A gong sounds outside, and all the villagers are heading off towards Vaal.",
38,2,The Apple,village,Kirk,,Mister Spock.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,,The villagers are walking into the serpent's mouth and depositing plates of fruit down it's throat. Kirk and Spock watch from behind a shrub.,
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,"Apparently, our hypothesis is correct. There is no living being there. It is a machine, nothing more."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,"Well, the field's down, people are going in. Let's see what kind of luck we have."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,,"But as soon as they stand, the eyes light up and there is a rumble of thunder.",
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,That's not the way.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,"Evidently not. This is no ordinary machine, Captain. It may well possess a rudimentary intelligence."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,But it needs to eat. Frequently. So it can't have any great power reserves.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,That may not be of any help. The Enterprise has only ten hours left in which to break free.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,"What happens if Vaal weakens around feeding time? Spock, check the electromagnetic section of the astrophysics lab. Get an estimate of the total amount of energy being expended against the ship. Have them measure it hour by hour."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,Acknowledged.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,,McCoy joins them.,
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Mccoy,,"What's going on, Jim?"
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,Mess call.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,"In my view, a splendid example of reciprocity."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Mccoy,,It would take a computerised Vulcan mind such as yours to make that kind of a statement.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,"Doctor, you insist on applying human standards to non-human cultures. I remind you that humans are only a tiny minority in this galaxy."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Mccoy,,"There are certain absolutes, Mister Spock, and one of them is the right of humanoids to a free and unchained environment, the right to have conditions which permit growth."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,Another is their right to choose a system which seems to work for them.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Mccoy,,"Jim, you're not just going to stand by and be blinded to what's going on here. These are humanoids, intelligent. They need to advance and grow. Don't you understand what my readings indicate? There's been no progress here in at least ten thousand years. This isn't life. It's stagnation."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,"Doctor, these people are healthy and they are happy. What ever you choose to call it, this system works, despite your emotional reaction to it."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Mccoy,,"It might work for you, Mister Spock, but it doesn't work for me. Humanoids living so they can service a hunk of tin."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,"Gentlemen, I think this philosophical argument can wait until our ship's out of danger. Kirk here."
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Scotty, sir. We have a reading on the power source Mister Spock requested. When we first monitored, it was generating alternating cycles totalling one hundred to the twentieth power Waltham units."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,"Did it maintain, Scotty?"
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"No, sir. Power's dropping bit by bit. Nominal, but a definite drain."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,Good. Keep monitoring. How are you coming along with the circuit switchover?
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"We're putting everything but the kitchen sink into impulse power, sir. It will take us another eight hours to complete the work."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,"That's cutting it a bit fine, Scotty."
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, but if we don't break out, I'd rather we didn't have to wait too long for the end of it."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,Kirk out.
38,2,The Apple,hut,Martha,,Every time I think of the Enterprise burning up and us
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,"Yeoman, you're wasting energy."
38,2,The Apple,hut,Martha,,"Captain, we're trapped,"
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,"Sit down, and have something to eat."
38,2,The Apple,hut,Martha,,The Enterprise is up there
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,"That hasn't happened yet. I wonder what would happen? Yeoman, speculate. What would happen if someone on this planet died?"
38,2,The Apple,hut,Martha,,But they can't. You said that Vaal takes care of them.
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,Accidents happen.
38,2,The Apple,hut,Martha,,"Yes, I suppose if someone were to fall off a cliff or something, that might upset the balance of the population. Then they would need a replacement."
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,"They'd need a replacement. Opinion, Mister Spock?"
38,2,The Apple,hut,Spock,,I see no alternative.
38,2,The Apple,hut,Martha,,"But these people, I mean, if they don't know anything about. What I mean is, they don't seem to have any natural er. I mean, how is it, done?"
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,Mister Spock? You're the science officer. Why don't you explain it to the young lady.
38,2,The Apple,hut,Spock,,"Well, I believe it's safe, (cough) safe to assume that they would receive the necessary instructions."
38,2,The Apple,hut,Mccoy,,From a machine? That I'd like to see.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Akuta,,"I understand, Vaal. It shall be done."
38,2,The Apple,village,,Chekov and Landon are taking a romantic stroll together.,
38,2,The Apple,village,Martha,,"You know, if it weren't for Vaal this place would be a paradise."
38,2,The Apple,village,,They are watched by a local couple,
38,2,The Apple,village,Chekov,,Any place we can be together is paradise.
38,2,The Apple,village,Martha,,"Pav, can the ship really break away?"
38,2,The Apple,village,Chekov,,I don't know.
38,2,The Apple,village,Martha,,Will we be able to get back aboard?
38,2,The Apple,village,Chekov,,"Martha, I don't know. But if we do have to stay here, would it be so very bad?"
38,2,The Apple,village,Martha,,"No, not if you're with me."
38,2,The Apple,village,,They kiss .,
38,2,The Apple,village,Sayana,,Why do you look like that?
38,2,The Apple,village,Makora,,The way they touched. I do not understand.
38,2,The Apple,village,Sayana,,They were not angry. I think it was pleasant for them.
38,2,The Apple,village,Makora,,"But what is to be gained? It is not a dance. It gathers no food. It does not serve Vaal. But it did seem as though it was, pleasant to them."
38,2,The Apple,village,,He kisses the girl's cheek.,
38,2,The Apple,village,Sayana,,"It is pleasant, Makora."
38,2,The Apple,village,Makora,,Yes. They touched in this way.
38,2,The Apple,village,Narrator,,They kiss properly and there is a roll of thunder.)
38,2,The Apple,village,Makora,,Vaal! He is angry.
38,2,The Apple,village,Akuta,,The law is plain. I have given you the words of Vaal. Do you beg the lightning to strike?
38,2,The Apple,village,Sayana,,"We saw the strangers, the two of them, do this thing."
38,2,The Apple,village,Akuta,,You copied them?
38,2,The Apple,village,Makora,,We meant no harm.
38,2,The Apple,village,Akuta,,Vaal speaks truly to me. The newcomers are a danger. Tell the men of Vaal to meet me in the clear place when the strangers are asleep. It is Vaal's own words.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,The men are waiting for Akuta. He arrives with a blue melon and a very big stick. AKUTA: Vaal has spoken to me. His words are true. Hear them. We are to kill the strangers,
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Makora,,"Kill, Akuta? We do not understand."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Akuta,,"It is a thing to do, like, like feeding Vaal. Vaal explained it to me. I will show you. This (the melon) is the head of one of the strangers. Find a heavy stick. Come up from behind the stranger and do this."
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,He swings his stick and smashes the melon to pieces.,
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,Akuta,,It is a simple thing. It is the word of Vaal. It will be done to all of them when the sun returns in the morning.
38,2,The Apple,planet surface,,But he looks worried.,
38,2,The Apple,hut,Spock,,"I am concerned, Captain. This may not be an ideal society, but it is a viable one."
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,"Bones was right. These people aren't living, they're existing. They don't create, they don't produce, they don't even think. They exist to service a machine."
38,2,The Apple,hut,Spock,,"If we do what it seems we must, in my opinion it will be in direct violation of the non-interference directive."
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,"These are people, not robots. They should have the opportunity of choice. We owe it to them to interfere."
38,2,The Apple,hut,Spock,,Starfleet Command may think otherwise.
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,I'll take my chances. Why don't you have a look around? Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott?
38,2,The Apple,hut,,Spock leaves,
38,2,The Apple,hut,Scott,,"Here, sir."
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,"How's it going, Scotty?"
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Almost ready, sir. We need half an hour yet."
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,"You realise that within forty five minutes, the ship will be pulled down into the atmosphere?"
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"I know that. As you said, that's cutting things fine."
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,"Yes, I"
38,2,The Apple,hut,Spock,,Captain!
38,2,The Apple,hut,Kirk,,Kirk out. What is it?
38,2,The Apple,hut,Spock,,Disturbing. The people of Vaal seem to have disappeared.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,"Force field, Captain."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,"Vaal, we are on a peaceful mission. We mean no harm to you or your people."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,,The sky darkens.,
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,"Variation in impulses, Captain. I believe it is reading us. A strong jump on all wavelengths."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,,Lightning threatens.,
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,Let's get out of here!
38,2,The Apple,vaal,,"But Spock is hit, with a nice hole in the back of his tunic.",
38,2,The Apple,village,Kirk,,Bones!
38,2,The Apple,village,Mccoy,,"Second degree burns. Not serious, but I'll bet they smart."
38,2,The Apple,village,Spock,,"Doctor, you have an unsurpassed talent for understatement."
38,2,The Apple,village,Kirk,,Marple!
38,2,The Apple,village,,"The red-shirt is struck by Akuta. The other men are easily eluded, disarmed and dealt with.",
38,2,The Apple,village,Kirk,,"Put them in the hut. Find out where the women are. Put them in there, too."
38,2,The Apple,village,Spock,,The good doctor was concerned that the Vaalians achieved true human stature. I submit there is no cause for worry. They've taken the first step. They've learned to kill.
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"We're ready here, sir. All available power has been channelled into the impulse engines. We have twelve minutes before entering atmosphere."
38,2,The Apple,village,Kirk,,"All right, Scotty, put her in full reverse. Get her out of there."
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Full reverse, Mister Kyle, all engines."
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Kyle,,Sir!
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Captain, we're doing it. We're pulling away!"
38,2,The Apple,village,Kirk,,"Scotty, what happened?"
38,2,The Apple,village,Kyle,,"It's no good, sir. There's only a few systems responding."
38,2,The Apple,village,Scott,,"Captain, we've pulled away a little. We gained maybe an hour, but we blew almost every system in the ship doing it."
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"There's nothing left to try again. I guess you'll have to fire me, sir."
38,2,The Apple,village,Kirk,,You're fired. Four hundred people
38,2,The Apple,village,Mccoy,,Jim
38,2,The Apple,village,Kirk,,"They'll die because I couldn't see a warning sign. I had to follow orders, always orders."
38,2,The Apple,village,,"The gong sounds, and the people of Vaal try to leave the hut.",
38,2,The Apple,village,Chekov,,Get back in there.
38,2,The Apple,village,Mccoy,,Fine time to ring the dinner bell.
38,2,The Apple,village,Chekov,,Get back in there. Now!
38,2,The Apple,village,Kirk,,"Bones, that's it. Stay with Chekov. Keep those people from feeding Vaal. Don't let them feed Vaal. Keep them in the hut. Mister Spock."
38,2,The Apple,village,,They head off through the shrubs.,
38,2,The Apple,village,Kirk,,"Scotty, do you still have phaser power?"
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, but what"
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Kirk,,Lock all banks on the co-ordinates of the energy field located down here.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Narrator,,"KIRK; On my command, commence firing on those co-ordinates."
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, sir, but they won't penetrate that force field."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,"If my guess is correct, they won't have to. Stand by."
38,2,The Apple,hut,Akuta,,Vaal calls to us. Let us go to him. He hungers. Please.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,"Readings are getting weaker, Captain. Wide variation in energy transmissions, as though Vaal were trying to draw on other sources. KIRK: Tapping its energy cells."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,I would assume so.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,"Good. The ship's pulling away must have weakened it considerable. It has to be fed, but its reserve capacity could hold out for days."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,"If it had to reinforce its energy field to ward off a phaser attack, it would have to draw more heavily on its reserves."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,My plan exactly. Scotty.
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Scott here, sir."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,"Scotty, commence firing and maintain."
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,"Mister Kyle, all phasers commence firing."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,,Two red beams hit the edge of the force field and start turning it green.,
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,"A tremendous upsurge in generated power, Captain. Obviously Vaal is trying to reinforce his energy field."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,Good. Let's see how long he can do it.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,,"The green glow arrives at the snake's head as the storm clouds gather. The lightning flashes, and small explosions go off inside Vaal. Smoke comes out of its mouth. Finally, the eyes stop glowing and the throat goes dark.",
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,"Scotty, cease fire."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,,The sun breaks through the clouds again.,
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Spock,,"No power generation at all, Captain. Vaal is dead."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,"Mister Scott, status report."
38,2,The Apple,bridge,Scott,,Tractor beam gone. Potency returning to antimatter pods.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Scott,,I'll have all engineering sections working on the circuits immediately. Transporter'll be ready in an hour.
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,"Scotty, you're re-hired. As soon as the transporter's fixed, form an engineering detail with full analytical equipment and beam them down. Kirk out. Chekov, Bones. Let those people go."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Akuta,,"But it was Vaal who put the fruit on the trees, caused the rain to fall. Vaal cared for us."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,"You'll learn to care for yourselves, with our help. And there's no trick to putting fruit on trees. You might enjoy it. You'll learn to build for yourselves, think for yourselves, work for yourselves, and what you create is yours. That's what we call freedom. You'll like it, a lot. And you'll learn something about men and women, the way they're supposed to be. Caring for each other, being happy with each other, being good to each other. That's what we call love. You'll like that, too, a lot. You and your children."
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Sayana,,What are children?
38,2,The Apple,vaal,Kirk,,The little ones? Look like you? Just go on the way you're going. You'll find out.

38,2,The Apple,corridor,Spock,,"That's not unusual, Doctor."
38,2,The Apple,corridor,Mccoy,,"Jim, I want you to hear this."
38,2,The Apple,corridor,Spock,,"Captain, I'm not at all certain we did the correct thing on Gamma Trianguli Six."
38,2,The Apple,corridor,Mccoy,,We put those people back on a normal course of social evolution. I see nothing wrong in that.
38,2,The Apple,corridor,Kirk,,"Well, that's a good object lesson, Mister Spock. It's an example of what can happen when a machine becomes too efficient, does too much work for you."
38,2,The Apple,corridor,Spock,,"Captain, you are aware of the biblical story of Genesis."
38,2,The Apple,corridor,Kirk,,"Yes, of course I'm aware of it. Adam and Eve tasted the apple and as a result were driven out of paradise."
38,2,The Apple,corridor,Spock,,"Precisely, Captain, and in a manner of speaking, we have given the people of Vaal the apple, the knowledge of good and evil if you will, as a result of which they too have been driven out of paradise."
38,2,The Apple,corridor,Kirk,,"Doctor, do I understand him correctly? Are you casting me in the role of Satan?"
38,2,The Apple,corridor,Spock,,"Not at all, Captain."
38,2,The Apple,corridor,Kirk,,Is there anyone on this ship who even remotely looks like Satan?
38,2,The Apple,corridor,,McCoy and Kirk walk around Spock. McCoy is gazing intently at his ears.,
38,2,The Apple,corridor,Spock,,"I am not aware of anyone who fits that description, Captain."

39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",planet surface,Tharn,,"We believe what you say, Captain Kirk, but our position has not altered. The Halkan Council cannot permit your Federation to mine dilithium crystals on our planet."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",planet surface,Kirk,,We have shown the council historical proof that our missions are peaceful.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",planet surface,Tharn,,"We accept that your Federation is benevolent at present, but the future is always in question. Our dilithium crystals represent awesome power. Wrongful use of that power, even to the extent of the taking of one life, would violate our history of total peace. To prevent that, we would die, Captain. As a race, if necessary."

39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",planet surface,Kirk,,When may we resume discussion?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",planet surface,Tharn,,"The council will meditate further, but do not be hopeful of any change. Captain, you do have the might to force the crystals from us, of course."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",planet surface,Kirk,,"But we won't. Consider that. Enterprise. Transporter room, energise."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kyle,,"Trouble, sir."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,,"Four figures start to materialise, then disappear again. The image of Enterprise in orbit reverses itself. Finally, four figures solidify, wearing strange uniforms with gold sashes. Uhura's midriff is bare.",

39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,,"Spock and Kyle greet their Captain with a semi-Nazi salute. Their uniforms have changes, and Spock has grown a very fetching goatee beard.",

39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate unknown. During an ion storm, my landing party has beamed back to the Enterprise and found it and the personnel aboard changed. The ship is subtly altered physically. Behaviour and discipline has become brutal, savage."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,"Mister Scott, the storm has caused some minor damage in your section. There are also injuries requiring your attention, Doctor. Well, gentlemen?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kyle,,Mister Spock.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,Yes.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kyle,,"The power beam jumped for a moment, sir, as the landing party was about to materialise. I never saw it happen before."

39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kyle,,"No, Mister Spock. Before."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,"Possibly a result of the severe storm. Captain, do you feel any abnormal effects?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,"Yes. Doctor McCoy, you'd better look us over. That was a rough beam-up."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Mccoy,,"Yes, sir."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, have those transporter circuits checked."

39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",corridor,Kirk,,Not now. Not now.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Mccoy,,"What is this? Everything's all messed up and changed around, out of place."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Uhura,,"Captain, what's happened?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Mccoy,,"No, not everything. That spot, I spilt acid there a year ago. Jim, What in blazes is this?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Kirk,,I don't know. It's our Enterprise but it isn't. Maybe
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Uhura,,"Maybe what, Captain?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Kirk,,Any of you feel dizzy when we were in the transporter beam?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Uhura,,Yes.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Scott,,Aye.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Kirk,,When we first materialised.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Scott,,I did.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Kirk,,"It happened twice. First we were in our own transporter chamber, then we faded, and then when we finally materialised, we were here. Wherever this is."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Scott,,"Captain, the transporter chief mentioned a surge of power. The transporter lock might have been affected by the ion storm and we just materialised somewhere else."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Kirk,,"Yes, here. Not our universe, not our ship. Something parallel. A parallel universe co-existing with ours on another dimensional plane. Everything's duplicated, almost. Another Enterprise. Spock with a beard."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Uhura,,"Another Captain Kirk, another Doctor McCoy, another"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Mccoy,,An exchange. If we're here
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Kirk,,"Then our counterparts must have been transporting up at the exact same time. Similar storms on both universes disrupted the circuits. We're here, and they're on our Enterprise. Probably asking the same questions. Are we in another universe, and if so, how do we get back to our own? They'll use the computer, and we have to."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Mccoy,,What about the Halkans? We can't let them be destroyed.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Kirk,,"Scotty, can you buy me some time. Get below and short out the main phaser couplings. They'll think the storm blew the stand-by circuits."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Scott,,"Aye, sir."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Kirk,,Then get on this technology. It's all we have to work with if we want to get back home. The intercom may be monitored. Use your communicators for private messages. Subfrequency and scramble.

39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",brig,Kirk2,,Has the whole galaxy gone crazy? What kind of a uniform is this? Where's your beard? What's going on? Where's my personal guard?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",brig,Spock,,I can answer none of your questions at this time.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",brig,Kirk2,,"All right, Spock. Whatever your game is, I'll play it. You want credits, I'll give them to you. You'll be a rich man. A command of your own? I can swing that, too."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",brig,Spock,,Apparently some kind of transposition has taken place. I find it extremely interesting.

39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",brig,Kirk2,,"Power, Spock? I can get that for you!"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",corridor,Spock,,"Captain, I am pleased that you frustrated Mister Chekov's plan. I should regret your death."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",corridor,Kirk,,Why?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",corridor,Spock,,I do not desire the captaincy. I much prefer my scientific duties. I am frankly content to be a lesser target.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",corridor,Kirk,,"Logical, as always, Mister Spock."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",corridor,,"They arrive at a cylinder containing Chekov, who is writhing in agony.",

39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",corridor,,They continue walking. Farrell joins Spock's personal guard walking behind his master.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",corridor,Kirk,,You heard my orders.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",corridor,Spock,,"They are, of course, in contradiction to standard Empire procedure. You cannot ignore the consequences."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",corridor,Kirk,,Is that a threat?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",corridor,Spock,,"I do not threaten, Captain. I merely state facts. I have found you to be an excellent officer. Our missions together have been both successful and profitable. However, I shall not permit your aberrations to jeopardise my position."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",corridor,Kirk,,"Spock, do you think we should destroy the Halkans?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",corridor,Spock,,Terror must be maintained or the Empire is doomed. It is the logic of history.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",corridor,Kirk,,"Conquest is easy, control is not. We may have bitten off more than we can chew."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",corridor,Spock,,"Captain, I do not wish to find myself opposing you, but if you continue on your present course, this confusing, inexplicable behaviour,"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",corridor,Kirk,,"Is my concern, not yours. You would find me a formidable enemy."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",corridor,Spock,,"I'm aware of that, Captain. I trust that you are aware of the reverse."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",corridor,,Spock and his bodyguard leave.,

39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,"I fell asleep. We had quite a time in the chem lab picking up after the storm. Nothing compared to your day, I gather. I heard about Chekov."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"He gambled, I won."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,You got lucky. I'm surprised you could be caught off-guard that way.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,I was preoccupied.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,. Marlena,,"You're still in trouble with Starfleet Command. What you've got in mind this time is beyond me. You're scheming, of course. The Halkans have something you want, or, is it all some clever means to advance you to the Admiralty? Kirk. The Cabinet itself?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Further than that, if I'm successful."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,"Really? Well, you must know what you're doing. You always do. If I'm to be the woman of a Caesar, can't I know what you're up to?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,,Their kiss is interrupted by the intercom.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Kirk here.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,Spock,,"Mister Spock, Captain."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,Kirk,,Yes.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,Spock,,I have received a private communication from Starfleet Command. I am committing a breach of regulations by informing you of its contents.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Yes, Mister Spock."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,Spock,,I am instructed to wait until planet dawn over principal target to permit you to carry out our mission.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,And if I don't?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,Spock,,"In that event, I am ordered to kill you and to proceed against the Halkans as the new captain of the Enterprise."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate unknown. We are trapped in a savage, parallel universe from which we must escape within four hours, or I will face a death sentence at Mister Spock's hands."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,"Let's drink a toast to Spock, The only man aboard with the decency to warn you, and he'll die for it. They'll never find another man like him."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,I don't intend to kill him.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,Are you going to act against the Halkans before the deadline?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"No, but I'll avoid killing Spock."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,"Just get him out of the way, he and his men."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,I'll get out of his way.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,"Shall I activate the Tantalus field? You'll at least want to monitor him, won't you?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Yes.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,,She touches a wall panel and it rises to reveal a screen and a collection of buttons.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,I hate this thing.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,It's not that bad.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,"Of course not. It made you captain. How many enemies have you simply wiped out of existence by the touch of a button? Fifty? A hundred? Now, I always thought that was funny, The great, powerful Captain Kirk who owes everything to some unknown alien scientist and a plundered laboratory."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Well, if you don't take advantage of your opportunities"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,You don't rise to the command of a starship or even higher.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,,"She switches it on, and Spock is seen sitting at his table.",
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,That magnificent mind of his. But it can't protect him from this. I press it and he dies. Now?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,,Kirk switches it off.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,"You really mean it. It doesn't matter. If Spock fails his order, he'll be killed anyway."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,I'll see to it that the circumstances of his failure will clear him.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,You're not even afraid of Starfleet Command. Can your scheme bring you that much power so quickly? And what about me? How does Marlena fit in?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,How does Marlena want to fit in?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,,She goes into the other room.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Scotty.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",engineering,Scott,,"Scotty here, sir."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,We have to get out of here within three hours. Spock has orders to kill me unless I complete the mission.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",engineering,Scott,,"We've got another deadline, too, sir."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",engineering,Kirk,,Explain.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",engineering,Scott,,"The two-way matter transmission affected the local field density between the universes, and it's increasing. We've got to move fast."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,How fast?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",engineering,Scott,,Half hour at the most.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,If we miss?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Scott,,We couldn't get out of here in a century. We're ready to bridge power from the engines to the transporter.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",engineering,Scott,,You've got to get down there and free the board so we can lock in. Give me about ten minutes.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Scott,,I've got to complete a few more computations.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,All right. I'll be in the transporter room in ten minutes. I'll meet you in Sickbay afterward.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",engineering,Scott,,"Aye, sir."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,Spock,,Computer?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,Computer,,ready.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,Spock,,Explain computer activity in the engineering section.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,Computer,,A security research is in progress.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,Spock,,Who is conducting the research?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,Computer,,The Captain and Mister Scott.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,Spock,,What is the nature of the research?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,Computer,,Programme is classified under voice index log.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,,A big red light starts flashing.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,Spock,,"Why are you monitoring my communications, Mister Sulu?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Sulu,,"My security board has detected extensive use of computer, Mister Spock. I was about to inform you."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,Sulu,,It's not hard to guess the nature of your order from Starfleet Command. I suggest a connection. The captain suspects.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Sulu,,He's working on escape or defence.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,Spock,,That is my concern.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Sulu,,"Correct. It's your play. I hope you succeed, because the order would fall on me next and you know how Captain Kirk's enemies have a habit of disappearing."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",spock's quarters,Spock,,"If I am successful, you see yourself a step nearer to the captaincy. I do not want to command the Enterprise, but if it should befall me, I suggest you remember that my operatives would avenge my death and some of them are Vulcans."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,,Marlena has changed into something more comfortable.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,"Oiling my traps, darling. I'm afraid I'm a little out of practice. Maybe that's what happened to us? It's very hard for a working officer to shine as a woman every minute, and you demand perfection."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"I've never seen perfection, but no woman could come closer to it."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,I remember when you used to talk that way.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,I still do.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,Prove it.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,I've got to go.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,"Ship's business? An important task on the crew deck? Well, I guess it's over. Commander Kenno will take me temporarily. He's made that quite clear. I'll call a yeoman to help me with my things."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,You don't have to do that.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,"Are you feeling sorry for me? Do I see hesitation in your eyes about anything? I want one thing, Captain. Transfer me. On the Enterprise, I am humiliated! On another ship, I can hunt fresh game. I've got my rank, and. Don't I? I've been a captain's woman, and I like it. I'll be one again if I have to go through every officer in the fleet."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,You could. (She turns to slap him.) I simply meant that you could be anything you want to be.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,,"They kiss, long and passionate.",
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Marlena,,"It's been a long time since you've kissed me like that. You're a stranger. Mercy to the Halkans, mercy to Spock, to me. Am I your woman?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Kirk,,You're the Captain's woman until he says you're not.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,,She turns on the Tantalus machine and watches him go into a turbolift.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",turbolift,Kirk,,Uhura?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",turbolift,Uhura,,"Yes, Captain."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",turbolift,Kirk,,Scotty's signal should be coming through any moment. You know what to do.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",turbolift,Uhura,,"I've got a pretty good idea, sir."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",turbolift,Kirk,,Keep Sulu's attention off that board.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",turbolift,Uhura,,"I'll do my best, sir."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",turbolift,Kirk,,Good luck. Kirk out.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",turbolift,,Scott is up a Jefferies tube. He signals Uhura.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Uhura,,"You aren't very persistent, Mister Sulu. The game has rules. You're ignoring them. I protest and you come back. You didn't come back."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Sulu,wrapping his arms around her naked waist,Now you're making sense.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Uhura,,I was getting bored. Of course this isn't the time.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,,The board beeps.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Sulu,,Any time's a good time.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,,"She slaps him, hard.",
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Uhura,,I'm afraid I changed my mind. Again.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Sulu,,"You take a lot of chances, Lieutenant."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Uhura,drawing her dagger,"So do you, Mister. So do you. Take over for me."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,,"She goes into the turbolift, and guards block Sulu's way.",
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",turbolift,Uhura,,"Mister Scott, all clear. On my way to Sickbay."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",jefferies tube,Mccoy,,Now it's up to the captain.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,"Please restrict your movements, Captain."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,"What are you doing? Are you going to shoot me now, Spock? I thought I had until dawn."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,"I shall make that decision. Since your return from the planet, you've behaved in a most atypical and illogical manner. I want to know why."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,Shoot. You're wasting time.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,"I shall not waste time with you. You're too inflexible, too disciplined once you've made up your mind. But Doctor McCoy has a plenitude of human weaknesses, sentimental, soft. You may not tell me what I want to know, but he will."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,"You're running a big risk, Spock."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,"I have the phaser, Captain, and I do not intend to simply disappear as so many of your opponents have in the past. If you please. Sickbay."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Spock,,"Yes, of course. The entire landing party. Captain, stand over there. Doctor, it is time for answers."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,,"Kirk knocks the phaser out of Spock's hand, and he and Scott try to fight him. Even Uhura gets pushed around. Finally, she hands Kirk a skull and he smashes it over Spock's head. He falls, unconscious.",
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Kirk,,"How much time, Scotty?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Scott,,"Hardly fifteen minutes, sir. The field density between the two universes is starting to close very fast."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Mccoy,,"Help me get him on the table. Well, come on. Help me get him on the table. He'll die without immediate treatment."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Kirk,,"Everything laid in, Scotty? The time lag so the operator can get into the transporter chamber?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Scott,,"All laid in, sir. Come on, McCoy! We're taking a chance of not getting back home."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Mccoy,,We'll get home. This won't take long.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Narrator,,{Marlena is still watching on the Tantalus screen.)
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Scott,,Fourteen minutes. We've got to go!
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,Shut up? I can save his life.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Mccoy,,"Do you want me to stop, Jim? It'll only take a minute."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Kirk,,"He is very much like our own Mister Spock, isn't he? You've got that minute."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"A little time, he'll live."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,,Sulu and three henchmen march in.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Kirk,,"What is this, Mister Sulu?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Sulu,,"Mister Spock has orders to kill you, Captain. He will succeed, apparently. You will also appear to have killed him after a fierce battle. Regrettable, but it will leave me in command."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,,"Then one of the henchmen disappears, and another. Marlena presses the button again and Sulu is alone. Kirk disarms and knocks him out easily.",
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Scott,,"Captain, we've barely got ten minutes."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Kirk,,"Let's go, Bones."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Mccoy,,"I can't let him die, Jim. You get on to the transporter room. I'll be there in five minutes."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Kirk,,No longer.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Mccoy,,"I guarantee it. Now, go on, please."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,,"Kirk, Scott and Uhura leave. McCoy gives Spock an injection.",
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Spock,sitting up and grabbing McCoy's arm,Why did the captain let me live?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,,He pushes him against the wall and does a mind meld.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",sickbay,Spock,,"Our minds are merging, Doctor. Our minds are one. I feel what you feel. I know what you know."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,,Marlena is waiting for them.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,A friend. Activate the transporter. You saved us back at Sickbay with the Tantalus field.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Marlena,,Take me with you.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,I can't. I'm sorry. Our power is balanced for four. There's no guarantee that we'll make it with five. All could die. Scotty?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Scott,,"It's working, sir."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Marlena,,But there are only three of you.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,"One is coming. I'd help you if I could, Marlena. Believe that."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,,She raises her phaser.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,"If you kill us, you'll still stay."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,,Uhura disarms Marlena.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,"Where's McCoy? Time, Scotty."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Scott,,"Five minutes, sir."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Marlena,,Do you know what they'll do to me?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Scott,,"The power's cut, sir. They're on to us."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,Auxiliary.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Scott,,"Aye, it's available."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,Can you bridge to your setup?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Scott,,"I can get us the power, but the automatic setting is linked to the transporter main. If we bypass, that means that someone has got to operate the controls manually."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,One of us will have to stay.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Scott,,"I'll stay, Captain."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,"Get to the transporter chamber. You, too, Uhura."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Scott,,Jim.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,"That's an order, Scotty."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Scott,,"Aye, Captain."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Marlena,,What about me?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,McCoy.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,,Spock enters with McCoy.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,I cut the transporter power. It was necessary to delay your beam-out until I could arrive. Take him.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,,Scott guides McCoy to the transporter pad.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,"Engineering, re-activate main transporter circuits."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,"You're a man of integrity in both universes, Mister Spock."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,You must return to your universe. I must have my captain back. I shall operate the transporter. You have two minutes and ten seconds.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,In that time I have something to say. How long before the Halkan prediction of galactic revolt is realised?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,Approximately two hundred and forty years.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,The inevitable outcome?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,"The Empire shall be overthrown, of course."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,"The illogic of waste, Mister Spock. The waste of lives, potential, resources, time. I submit to you that your Empire is illogical because it cannot endure. I submit that you are illogical to be a willing part of it."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,You have one minute and twenty three seconds.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,"If change is inevitable, predictable, beneficial, doesn't logic demand that you be a part of it?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,One man cannot summon the future.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,"But one man can change the present. Be the captain of this Enterprise, Mister Spock. Find a logical reason for sparing the Halkans and make it stick. Push till it gives. You can defend yourself better than any man in the fleet."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Scott,,"Captain, get in the chamber!"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,"What about it, Spock?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,A man must also have the power.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,In my cabin is a device that will make you invincible.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,Indeed?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,What will it be? Past or future? Tyranny or freedom? It's up to you.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,It is time.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,"In every revolution, there's one man with a vision."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,"Captain Kirk, I shall consider it."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,,He beams them away.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,,"Back on the 'proper' Enterprise, in the right uniforms.",
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Kirk,,Spock.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",transporter room,Spock,,"Welcome home, Captain."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Kirk,,What I don't understand is how were you able to identify our counterparts so quickly?
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Spock,,"It was far easier for you as civilised men to behave like barbarians, than it was for them as barbarians to behave like civilised men. I assume they returned to their Enterprise at the same time you appeared here."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Kirk,,"Probably. However, that Jim Kirk will find a few changes, if I read my Spocks correctly."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Mccoy,,"Jim, I think I liked him with a beard better. It gave him character. Of course almost any change would be a distinct improvement."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Kirk,,What worries me is the easy way his counterpart fitted into that other universe. I always thought Spock was a bit of a pirate at heart.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Spock,,"Indeed, gentlemen. May I point out that I had an opportunity to observe your counterparts here quite closely. They were brutal, savage, unprincipled, uncivilised, treacherous, In every way, splendid examples of homo sapiens, the very flower of humanity. I found them quite refreshing."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Kirk,,"I'm not sure, but I think we've been insulted."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Mccoy,,I'm sure.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,,A women steps out of the turbolift.,
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Marlena,,Captain Kirk.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant, er, Lieutenant?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Marlena,,Marlena Moreau. I was just assigned last week.
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Kirk,,"All right, Lieutenant. Carry on."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Spock,,"You've met her before, Captain?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Kirk,,"Uh, why do you ask?"
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Spock,,"Your reaction, One of recognition."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,Kirk,,"Oh, no. No, no. We haven't met before, exactly. She just seemed a nice, likable girl. I think we could become friends. It's possible."
39,2,"Mirror, Mirror",bridge,,"And to prove it, he leaves his chair and goes over to stand next to her.",
40,2,The Deadly Years,settlement,,"Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scott, Chekov and Galway beam down to a group of pre-fabricated buildings. The sky is orange.",
40,2,The Deadly Years,settlement,Kirk,,Where is everyone?
40,2,The Deadly Years,settlement,Mccoy,,Perhaps they weren't expecting us.
40,2,The Deadly Years,settlement,Spock,,"Our arrival was scheduled well in advance, Doctor. The annual check of every scientific expedition is routine."
40,2,The Deadly Years,settlement,Kirk,,"I had a subspace contact with a Robert Johnson, the leader of this expedition, an hour ago."
40,2,The Deadly Years,settlement,Mccoy,,Did he report anything wrong?
40,2,The Deadly Years,settlement,Kirk,,"No, yet there was something wrong. I can't pin it down. His conversation was disjointed, his thoughts a little foggy, unrelated. Chekov, check that building. Mister Spock and I will check this one. The rest of you, take a look around. See if you can find anyone."
40,2,The Deadly Years,settlement,,Chekov goes into the dark building - it has no windows - and the light comes on as he bumps up against a table bearing the body of a very old man. He panics and runs out again.,
40,2,The Deadly Years,settlement,Chekov,,Captain! Captain! Captain! Captain!
40,2,The Deadly Years,settlement,Kirk,,What is it?
40,2,The Deadly Years,settlement,Chekov,,"A man, sir. In there. A dead man."
40,2,The Deadly Years,building,,"Again, the lights only come on when the party reaches the table in the middle of the room.",
40,2,The Deadly Years,building,Kirk,,Well?
40,2,The Deadly Years,building,Mccoy,,Exactly what it looks like. Death by natural causes. Old age.
40,2,The Deadly Years,building,Spock,,"Quite impossible, Doctor. I ran a personnel check on this expedition before we beamed down. I assure you that none of them were"

40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,,"Mister Johnson, can you hear me?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Robert,,"I can hear you. Not deaf yet, you know. Not yet."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,,Can you tell me what happened?
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Robert,,What happened?
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,,Did your instruments show anything?
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Robert,,Elaine was so beautiful. So beautiful. So beautiful.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,"He can hear you, Jim, but he doesn't understand. Let's let him rest."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,to nurse,"If they seem lucid, I'll be in the briefing room."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,"Stay seated. Commodore Stocker, I've asked you to be part of this briefing because Gamma Hydra Four falls in your administrative area."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Stocker,,"I appreciate that, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,"Doctor Wallace, as an expert in endocrinology, I'd appreciate you working very closely Doctor McCoy."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Wallace,a young blonde woman in a pink dress,"Yes, Captain."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,"Doctor McCoy, would you fill them in?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Mccoy,,"The expedition is suffering from extreme old age, and they're growing older by the minute. Much older. My examinations have turned up absolutely nothing. In fact, I don't have a clue."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,"What about the atmosphere and environment, Mister Spock?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,Sensors reveal nothing which is inimical to human life. The atmosphere screens out the usual amount of harmful cosmic rays.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,We're close to the neutral Zone between our Federation and the Romulan empire. It's possible the Romulans have a new weapon and are using this colony as guinea pigs.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"I have already begun investigation into that possibility, Captain."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,"Good. I want you all to check out everything in your own departments. No matter how remote, how far-fetched the notion, I want it run down. We'll stay in orbit until we have the answer."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Stocker,,I'm sure you understand that I'm anxious to get to Starbase Ten to assume my new post.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,"Yes, Commodore. We'll do everything we can to make sure you make your duty."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Stocker,,"Thank you, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,,"Everyone leaves, but Doctor Wallace remains seated.",
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,"Doctor, is there something I can do for you?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Wallace,,"Well, be a little less the cool, efficient Captain and a little more the old friend."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,How long has it been?
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Wallace,,"Six years, four months, and an odd number of days. You mean you don't know?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,"Well, it's been a long time. Things wouldn't change if it started all over again, would it? You have your job, I have my ship, and neither one of us will change."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Wallace,,"You said it. I didn't. In all those years, I only heard from you once. A stargram when my husband died. You know, you never asked me why I got married after we called it off."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,"Well, I supposed that you met someone you loved."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Wallace,,I met a man I admired. A great man.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,And in your field as you. You didn't give up a thing.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Wallace,,No. Just you.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Uhura,,"Captain Kirk, Mister Spock would like to see you on the Bridge."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,I'm on my way.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,"Standard orbit, Captain."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,Maintain.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Spock,,"I've rechecked the sensors, Captain. Gamma Hydra Four checks out as a Class M planet with a conventional oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere and normal mass. I can find nothing at all out of the ordinary."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,What about the comet that astrophysics reported?
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Spock,,We're checking it on it. I've reached no conclusions as yet. The comet was a rogue and has never been investigated.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Stocker,,Captain Kirk?
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, Commodore."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Stocker,,Facilities at Starbase Ten are much more complete than those on board ship. It seems to me that your investigations would be facilitated if we proceeded there. I assure you all co-operation.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"Thank you. You're anxious to get to the base, but we have a few facilities of our own here. I think the Enterprise will do quite nicely. I'll be in engineering, Mister Spock. Maintain standard orbit, Mister Sulu."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,"You already gave that command, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"Oh? Well, follow it."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,Lieutenant Galway.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Galway,a petite woman,"Doctor, may I speak to you for a moment, please?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,Of course. Go right ahead.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Galway,,"I know this is going to sound foolish, but I seem to be having a little trouble hearing."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,It's probably nothing important.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Galway,,I never had trouble before.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well, don't worry about it. Perhaps a little hypersonic treatment might clear it up."

40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,,You did what you could.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,Which adds up to absolutely nothing.
40,2,The Deadly Years,mccoy's office,Scott,,"Doctor McCoy, this is Scott. May I come see you?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"All you need are vitamins, but you can come up anyhow."

40,2,The Deadly Years,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,You take over my job and see what happens to you.
40,2,The Deadly Years,mccoy's office,Kirk,,I see what you mean.
40,2,The Deadly Years,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"What's your problem, Jim?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,mccoy's office,Kirk,,Shoulder. Just a twinge. Probably muscular strain.
40,2,The Deadly Years,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"You're probably right, Doctor. By the way, I don't like how you've been running this ship lately."
40,2,The Deadly Years,mccoy's office,Kirk,,All right. Reprimand received. Go ahead.
40,2,The Deadly Years,mccoy's office,,"McCoy scans his arm, then takes hold of a finger. Kirk pulls back in pain.",
40,2,The Deadly Years,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"Jim, I think we better'd run a complete physical on you."
40,2,The Deadly Years,mccoy's office,Kirk,,"Why? Just muscular strain, isn't it?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"No, Jim. It's advanced arthritis, and it's spreading."
40,2,The Deadly Years,mccoy's office,Kirk,,That's impossible.

40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,,"Report, Bones."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,"All of us who went down to the surface, with the exception of Chekov, are aging at various rates. Approximately thirty years for each day. I don't know what's causing it. A virus, a bacteria, or evil spirits, but I'm trying to find out."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,,"Spock, could I ask for some figures?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Spock,looking about the same as usual,"Based on what Doctor McCoy gave me, I estimate that physically we each have less than a week to live. Also, since our mental faculties are aging faster than our bodies, we will be little better than mental vegetables in considerably lesser time."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,,Total senility?
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Spock,,"Yes, Captain. In a very short time."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,,"What a way to die. All right. I want all the research facilities, all the scientific technicians, to start round-the-clock research immediately. I want the answers, and I want the remedy. Let's start by finding out why Chekov hasn't been affected."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,I'm doing what I can. (to Spock) You're perfectly healthy.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Spock,sitting up,"I must differ with you, Doctor. I'm having difficulty concentrating, which is most disturbing, my eye sight appears to be failing, and the normal temperature of the ship seems to me to be increasingly cold."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I did not say you weren't affected, Mister Spock. You are perfectly healthy, that is, for any normal Vulcan on the high side of a hundred."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Scott,,"Captain, can I go back to my station?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,,You feel up to it?

40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,"You can leave, too, Lieutenant Galway. Lieutenant Galway?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Galway,,"What? You spoke to me, Doctor?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Yes, I spoke to you. I said that you could leave, too. Now why don't you go down to your quarters and get some sleep."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Galway,,"No. I don't want to sleep. Can't you understand? If I sleep, what will I find when I wake up?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,,Camera finally pans over to show us an old woman with a dowagers hump.,

40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,I don't know.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,,"Well I want to know! Is it his youth, his blood type, his heritage, his glands, his genes?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,"His genes. All right, nurse. Prepare Chekov for another complete physical."

40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Wallace,,We both go in the same direction.
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Kirk,,So we do.
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Wallace,,"Look, we know the problem. We know the progress of the affliction. Therefore, once we find the proper line of research, it's only logical we find the solution."
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Kirk,,You sound like my first officer.
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Wallace,,No problem is insoluble. Not even ours.
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Kirk,,That didn't spring from logic.
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Wallace,,"Our situation doesn't have its roots in logic. The heart is not a logical organ. When I married Theodore Wallace, I thought I was over you. I was wrong."
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Kirk,,When did you realise that? Today?
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Wallace,,What?
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Kirk,,How much older was your husband than you?
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Wallace,,What difference does that make?
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Kirk,,Answer me.
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Wallace,,Twenty six years.
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Kirk,,That's quite a difference.
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Wallace,,"Jim, he was a brilliant man. We were stationed on a lonely outpost. We were working together. I don't want to talk about him. I want to talk about us."
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Kirk,,Look at me. Look at me. What do you see?
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Wallace,,"I see Captain James Kirk, a man of morality, decency, handsome, and strong."
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Kirk,,And old. And rapidly growing older.
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Wallace,,"Jim, please."
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Kirk,,"What are you offering me, Jan? Love, or a going away present?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Chekov,,"Give us some more blood, Chekov. The needle won't hurt, Chekov. Take off your shirt, Chekov. Roll over, Chekov. Breathe deeply, Chekov. Blood sample, Chekov. Marrow sample, Chekov. Skin sample, Chekov. If I live long enough, I'm going to run out of samples."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,You'll live.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Chekov,,"Oh, yes. I'll live, but I won't enjoy it."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,"Maintaining standard orbit, Captain."

40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, aye, sir."

40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,,"He drops the pen, she starts to stoop to pick it up.",
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"Yeoman. (picks the pen up) You have a reason for being on the Bridge, Commodore Stocker?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Stocker,,I'd hoped for a few words with you at your convenience.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,I have very little time.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Stocker,,"If I may say so sir, we have a due date at Starbase Ten."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,We're going to be late. I don't intend to leave this area until we've found the solution for this problem.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Stocker,,"Captain, I'm watching four very valuable and one almost irreplaceable members of the Starfleet failing before my eyes. I want to do something to help."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, yes. If you're so concerned, I'll send a message to Starbase Ten."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, you sent such a message this morning."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,Yeoman? Where's that
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Atkins,,Sir?
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,Fuel consumption report?
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Atkins,,I gave it to you. You signed it.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"If I'd signed it, I wouldn't have asked for it, now would l?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Atkins,,"Your signature, Captain."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,,"Later, everyone is tip-toeing around an obviously sleeping Captain in his comfy chair. Spock enters, unaware.",

40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,Mister Spock. I was just thinking.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Spock,,"Yes, sir. Quite understandable."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,You have something to report?
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Spock,,"Yes, sir. We have the cause of the affliction."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,What is it?
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Spock,,"The orbit of Gamma Hydra Four carried the planet directly through the comet's trail. On conventional radiation settings, we discovered nothing. On resetting our sensors to the extreme lower range of the scale, undetected radiation appeared. Below normal radiation levels but definitely present, and undoubtedly residue from the comet."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"Good, Spock. Well done. Let's get this to Doctor McCoy immediately. Oh. Lieutenant, take a message to Starfleet Command. Due to the proximity of the Romulans, you'd better use Code two."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Uhura,,"But, Captain, the Romulans have broken Code two. If you remember the last bulletin"
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,Then use Code three.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir. Code three."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"Message. Key to affliction may be comet which passed by Gamma Hydra Four. Said comet is now,"
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Spock,consulting PADD,"Quadrant four four eight, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"Quadrant. All units are to be alerted for complete analysis of radiation and means found to neutralise it. Comet is highly dangerous. Kirk, commanding Enterprise. Immediately, Lieutenant. Let's go."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"Oh, Mister Sulu. Increase orbit to twenty thousand mile perigee."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,"You mean another twenty thousand, Captain?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"I fail to understand why each one of my commands is being questioned. Now do as you're told, Mister Sulu."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Spock,,"Mister Sulu, what is our present position?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,"Orbiting at twenty thousand, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,Maintain.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,"Maintaining, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,biochemistry lab,Mccoy,,"Radiation? That's as good an answer as any, but why didn't we know about it earlier?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,biochemistry lab,Spock,,"Possibly, Doctor, because my thinking processes are not as efficient as before."
40,2,The Deadly Years,biochemistry lab,Mccoy,to Wallace,"Run this through, Doctor."
40,2,The Deadly Years,biochemistry lab,Kirk,,"All right, Bones, I'm going up to the Bridge. Keep me posted. Spock?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,biochemistry lab,Spock,,"I have a question for the doctor. (Kirk leaves) Doctor, the ship's temperature is increasingly uncomfortable for me. I've adjusted the environment in my quarters to one hundred twenty five degrees, which is at least tolerable. However, I"
40,2,The Deadly Years,biochemistry lab,Mccoy,,"Well, I see I'm not going to be making any house calls on you."
40,2,The Deadly Years,biochemistry lab,Spock,,I wondered if perhaps there was something which could lower my sensitivity to cold.
40,2,The Deadly Years,biochemistry lab,Mccoy,,"I'm not a magician, Spock, just an old country doctor."
40,2,The Deadly Years,biochemistry lab,Spock,,Yes. As I always suspected. (leaves)
40,2,The Deadly Years,biochemistry lab,Wallace,,"Doctor McCoy, none of our usual radiation therapies will have any effect on this radiation sickness."
40,2,The Deadly Years,biochemistry lab,Mccoy,,"Well, then we just start over, that's all. We work harder, faster, and we start completely from scratch if we have to. But we find something."
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Stocker,,"Spock, can I have a word with you?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Spock,,Commodore?
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Stocker,,"Mister Spock, a starship can function with a Chief Engineer, a Chief Medical Officer, even a First Officer under physical par. But it's disastrous to have a commanding officer whose condition is any less than perfection."
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Spock,,I am aware of that.
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Stocker,,"Please understand me. My admiration for Captain Kirk is unbounded. He is a great officer. But Mister Spock, I need your help and your co-operation."
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Spock,,"For what, sir?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Stocker,,I would like you to take over command of the Enterprise.
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Spock,,"On what grounds, Commodore?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Stocker,,"On the grounds that the captain, because of his affliction, is unable to perform his duties."
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Spock,,"Need I remind you, sir, that I too have contracted the same affliction?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Stocker,,"Yes, but you're a Vulcan. You have a much greater life span. You show the affects to a much smaller degree."
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Spock,,"I'm half human, sir. My physical reflexes are down, my mental capacity is reduced. I tire easily. No, sir. I am not fit for command."
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Stocker,,"Well, if you are not, with your Vulcan physique, then obviously Captain Kirk cannot be."
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Spock,,"Sir, I do have duties to perform."
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Stocker,,"Mister Spock. I do not like what I'm about to say but regulations demand it. And as a Starfleet flag officer, I must follow regulations. As second in command of the Enterprise, you must convene an extraordinary competency hearing."
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Spock,,"I resist that suggestion, Commodore."
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Stocker,,"It's not a matter of choice. When a captain is unfit, physically or mentally, a competency hearing is mandatory. Please don't make me quote a regulation which you know as well as I do."
40,2,The Deadly Years,corridor,Spock,,"Very well, sir. The hearing shall convene at fourteen hundred hours."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,,Chekov is back on the biobed.,
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,Now this isn't going to hurt a bit.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Chekov,,That's what you said the last time.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,Did it hurt?
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Chekov,,Yes.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Galway,,Doctor.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,,She collapses in Kirk's arms.,
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,,Bones.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,"She's dead. Her metabolism caused her to age more rapidly than the rest of us, but the same thing's going to happen to us unless"
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,,"How long have we got, Bones?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Oh, a matter of days. Perhaps hours."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,Let it read that this competency hearing was ordered by Commodore Stocker and reluctantly called by myself.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,Let it also read that I consider it invalid.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Stocker,,"Mister Spock, may I make a statement? I have had to resort to these legal grounds in order to save the lives of some very valuable members of the Starfleet. I have tried to convince Captain Kirk of the necessity of proceeding to Starbase Ten, but I've been overruled in each case. The responsibility of this hearing is mine."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"On the contrary, Commodore. As presiding officer and as second in command of the Enterprise, the responsibility is mine. Captain Kirk, would you like to make a statement?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,"Yes, I would like to make a statement. I am the captain of this ship and am totally capable of commanding her. Let's call this whole thing off and get back to work."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"It is quite impossible, Captain. The regulations are quite specific. You are entitled to direct examination of all witnesses immediately after the board has questioned them."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,"Very kind of you, Spock."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"Mister Sulu, how long have you served with Captain Kirk?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Sulu,,"Two years, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"To your knowledge, has he ever had any difficulty making decisions?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Sulu,,"No, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,Did he order you to maintain standard orbit around Gamma Hydra Four?
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Sulu,,"Yes, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"Did he not, several minutes later, repeat that order?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Sulu,,"Yes, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,Did he order you to increase orbit?
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Sulu,,"Yes, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,Did he not several minutes later repeat that order?
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,"He did not. When I give an order, I expect it to be obeyed. I don't have to repeat myself."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"Mister Sulu, please answer the question."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Sulu,,"Yes, sir. Captain Kirk repeated his order."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"Thank you, Mister Sulu. Yeoman Atkins, you handed Captain Kirk a fuel consumption report in the presence of witnesses, which he read and signed. Is that correct?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Atkins,,"Sir, he had more important things on his mind."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"Yeoman, you will simply answer the question."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Atkins,,"I, I guess he forgot he'd signed it."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,You guess?
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Atkins,,He'd forgot he'd signed it.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"Thank you, Yeoman. You may leave. Lieutenant Uhura. I have here a bulletin from Starfleet Command which states that the Romulans have broken Code two. Are these your initials which appear at the bottom?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Uhura,,They are.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,And whose initials are those which appear directly below yours?
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Uhura,,Those of Captain Kirk.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,Did Captain Kirk ask you to send a message about the comet which passed Gamma Hydra Four?
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Uhura,,He did.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,Using Code two.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Uhura,,"Oh, yes, but he changed it to Code three."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,After you reminded him that the Romulans had broken Code two.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Uhura,,Yes.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"Thank you, Lieutenant. Doctor McCoy, Doctor McCoy!"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Mccoy,waking up,"Yes, Spock? What is it?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"Several hours ago, at the request of this board, you ran a complete physical examination of Captain Kirk."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Mccoy,,I did.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"Medical banks, compute described subject's physical age, using established norms as comparative base."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Computer,,"Working. Subject's physical age based on physiological profile, between sixty and seventy two. Aging rapidly."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,"No, I'm thirty four. I'm thirty four years old."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Stocker,,"The computer differs with you, Captain."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,Doctor McCoy.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Mccoy,,Yes.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,Will you give us your professional evaluation of Captain Kirk's present physical condition.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Captain Kirk is suffering from a, a peculiar physical degeneration which strongly resembles aging."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,Is not his mental capacity degenerating even more rapidly?
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Yes, yes, but he's a better man right now"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"Doctor, you heard the computer's analysis of Captain Kirk's physical age. Do you agree with it?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Mccoy,,"It's a blasted machine, Spock! You can't argue with a machine."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"Do you agree with it, Doctor?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Yes. Yes, I do, agree. And I am sorry, Jim."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"This board has no further questions. Unless you, Commodore Stocker, have something that you would like to add."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Stocker,,"No. I am quite satisfied, Mister Spock."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"Do you wish to call any witnesses, Captain Kirk?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,"I am perfectly capable of speaking in my own defence, Mister Spock."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"Captain, I would suggest"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,"No, no, no. It's all right, Spock. It's all right. There's only one reason, and one reason alone, for having this, hearing. I refused to leave Gamma Hydra Two"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"Gamma Hydra Four, Captain."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,Yes. A slip of the tongue.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"You're inability to remember having given commands, reading and signing important orders and then forgetting them, your physical analysis as compiled by our own chief surgeon. All these things would appear to be irrefutable proof of failing physical and mental conditions."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,"So I'm a little confused. Who wouldn't be at a time like this? My ship's in trouble, my senior officers are ill. And this nonsense about a competency hearing is enough to mix up any man. Trying to relieve a captain of his command is, well, that's, that's. Spock, I wouldn't have believed it of you. Go ahead. Ask me questions. I'll show you what I'm capable of. There's nothing wrong with my memory. Go ahead! Ask me anything! We're in orbit around Gamma Hydra Two, right? Anyhow, it doesn't matter. There's a lot more to running a starship than answering a lot of fool questions. A lot more. Go ahead. Ask me questions."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"We have no more questions, Captain."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,Ask me anything. Anything.
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"There'll be no more questions, Captain. If you would leave the room so the board can vote"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Kirk,,"Good idea. Get this stupid voting over with so I can get back to running the ship. The most fool thing I ever heard of. Competency hearing when there's work to be done. I'll be in my quarters, awaiting your decision. (leaves)"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Stocker,,"Well, since the senior officers are incapable and I am of flag rank, I am forced by regulations to assume command."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,"Sir, you have never commanded a starship."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Stocker,,"What would you have, a junior officer with far less experience than I have?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Spock,,The danger from the Romulans
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Stocker,,"Mister Spock, we have to save these people. Mister Sulu, set a direct course for Starbase Ten. Warp five."
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Sulu,,Across the Neutral Zone?
40,2,The Deadly Years,briefing room,Stocker,,"Immediately, Mister Sulu. All officers are to return to their posts."
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,,Wallace and Spock enter.,
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Spock?
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"Yes, Captain."
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"So, I've been relieved."
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"I'm sorry, Captain."
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Yes. You should've been a prosecuting attorney.
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Spock,,Regulations require
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Regulations. Don't give me regulations. You've wanted command all along. First little excuse you get
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"Captain, I have not assumed command."
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"I hope you're proud of. What do you mean, you've not assumed command?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"I suffer the same affliction as you, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"If you're not in command, who is?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Spock,,Commodore Stocker.
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Stocker? Are you crazy? He's never had a field command.
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Spock,,Mister Scott was unfit for command. Commodore Stocker is ranking officer
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,No! Don't talk to me about rank! The man's a chair-bound paper-pusher. I order you to take command.
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"I cannot, Captain."
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Are you refusing a direct order?
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"No, sir. Only Commodore Stocker can give a command order onboard this ship."
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"You traitorous, disloyal, you stab me in the back the first chance you get? Spock. Get out. I never want to have to look at you again."
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,,Spock leaves.,
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Jan, Jan."
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Wallace,,"Oh, Jim. I'm sorry. Truly I am."
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"I made a fool of myself in there. I shouldn't have let them confuse me, rattle me."
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Wallace,,Everybody understood.
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"But I'm not old, Jan. I'm not. A few muscular aches doesn't make a man old. And you don't run a starship with your arms. You run it with your head. My brain's as sharp as it ever was. A simple case of radiation poisoning, and they relieve me of my command. I admit I'm getting a little grey, but radiation will do that to you."
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Wallace,,"Oh, Jim, will you forgive me? I have work to do."
40,2,The Deadly Years,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Jan, you know me. Look at me closely. Tell me. Am I getting old?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Kirk,,What are you doing here?
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Spock,,It would seem to be the place where I can be of the most use.
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Kirk,,Maybe you'd like to relieve Doctor McCoy. What about Chekov?
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Mccoy,,Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Kirk,,"Bones, there has to be. There has to be. We beamed down together. We were on the surface together. The same spot. We were together all the time."
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Spock,,"No, not all the time. Captain, he left us for a few moments."
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Kirk,,"He left us? He left us. He went into the building. Spock, something happened."
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Spock,,"Yes. Yes, indeed, Captain. Doctor, you remember"
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Kirk,,He was scared! He saw the dead body and he ran out of the building and he was scared to death.
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Mccoy,,"Yes, yes. Now that could be. Right. Scared. Heart beats faster, breathe gets short, and there's cold sweats and adrenaline flows. Adrenal activity. Now hold on Just a minute. There was something that I read once. It was ancient history, just after the atomic age. Used for radiation sickness. Adrenaline."
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Wallace,,"Doctor, hyronalin is the specific accepted for all radiation sickness."
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Mccoy,,"Yes, yes. Now. But before, adrenaline. Highly promising. Early research, but they abandoned it when hyronalin was discovered."
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Spock,,"Quite possible, Doctor. Perhaps a sufficiently efficacious compound could be developed."
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Mccoy,,"Don't just stand there jawing, Spock. You and Doctor Wallace get cracking."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,"Entering Romulan Neutral Zone, sir. All sensors on maximum."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Stocker,,"Thank you, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant Uhura, let me know if we contact any Romulan."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,,The ship is shaken by an impact.,
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Uhura,,"I think we just made contact, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,"Romulans approaching from both sides. We're bracketed, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Uhura,,"Engineering wants instructions, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Chekov,,"Commodore Stocker, what are your orders? Commodore! (But he is transfixed by the sight of another weapon blast heading for them on the viewscreen.)"
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Kirk,,I'm going up to the bridge.
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Mccoy,,"No, Jim. You can't do it."
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Kirk,,I have to go to the bridge. We're under attack.
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Mccoy,,Nurse? Doctor Wallace!
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Kirk,,Let me go.
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Mccoy,,Nurse.
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Wallace,,Jim.
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Chapel,,"Easy, Captain."
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,Kirk,,We're under attack. I have to go to the Bridge. I've got to go to the bridge.
40,2,The Deadly Years,doctor's office,,But they bustle him into the ward instead.,
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Stocker,,Keep trying to raise the Romulans.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Uhura,,"I'm trying, Commodore."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Stocker,,"If I could talk to them, explain to them why we violated the Neutral Zone."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Uhura,,The Romulans are notorious for not listening to explanations.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,"Lieutenant Uhura is right, sir. We've tangled with them before."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,,"Greenhorn, up there ruining my ship."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Wallace,,"Jim, if I have to give you a shot"
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Jim-boy, you just lay quiet. You can't do no good. We're both through."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,,No. No. My ship. My ship.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,,Spock totters in carrying a small beaker.,
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Spock,,"Doctor, I made the necessary computations and produced this serum. It is crude and dangerous, but we have no time for refinements."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,"All right. Let's, let's go."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Spock,,"It could cure or kill, Doctor."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,Don't give me any Vulcan details. Just give me the shot.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,,No. I'll take the first shot.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,You can't.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,,How long do you think this ship can take the pounding? I've got to get up there.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Wallace,,"Jim, it could kill you."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,,I'll die anyway. Do it.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Spock,,"Doctor Wallace, give him the shot."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Kirk,,Quickly. Quickly.
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,,"She does, and he goes into convulsions. Fortunately he is already strapped down.",
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,"Sir, they've fired another."
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,,"As the Enterprise continues to be battered, Kirk is writhing and groaning.",
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well, well, what's happening?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,sickbay,Wallace,,The ageing process has stopped. His bodily functions are getting stronger.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Uhura,,"Sir, I've tried all known hailing frequencies. They simply ignore us."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Stocker,,"Opinion, Mister Sulu."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,They know they have us. They know our shields will give out.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Stocker,,"Well then, we have no alternative but to surrender."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Chekov,,"Sir, the Romulans do not take captives."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,"We're losing power, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Stocker,,What am I going to do? I've got to do something.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"Report, Mister Sulu."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,We're surrounded by Romulan vessels. Maximum of ten. Range fifty to a hundred thousand kilometres.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"Engineering, this is the captain. I want full emergency power. I want everything within about two minutes. I want the warp drive engines on full standby. Kirk out. Open up a special channel to Starfleet Command. Code two."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Uhura,,"But, Captain, Code"
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"That's an order, Lieutenant. Code two."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, Captain. Code two."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"Message. From Enterprise to Starfleet Command this sector. Have inadvertently encroached upon Romulan Neutral Zone. Surrounded and under heavy Romulan attack. Escape impossible, shields failing. Will implement destruct order using corbomite device recently installed. Since this will result in the destruction of the Enterprise and all matter in a two hundred thousand kilometre diameter and establish a corresponding dead zone, all Federation ships will avoid this area for the next four solar years. Explosion will take place in one minute. Kirk, commanding Enterprise, out. Mister Sulu, course one eight eight degrees, mark fourteen. Speed, warp factor eight. Stand by."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,"Standing by, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Spock,,"Romulans giving ground, Captain. Obviously, they tapped in as you expected them to."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"A logical assumption, Mister Spock. Are they still retreating?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Spock,,"Yes, sir."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"Good. All hands, stand by. Warp factor eight, now."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Spock,,"The Romulans were caught off guard, Captain. They're falling behind."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"Are we out of range, Mister Sulu?"
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,"Yes, sir. And out of the Neutral Zone."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"Secure from Red Alert. Adjust a new course, two five seven degrees, mark three. Heading for Starbase Ten."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,"Two five seven degrees, mark three."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Stocker,,"Captain, I just wanted to assure you that I did what I thought best to save you and the men."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"Noted. You should know, however, that there's very little a Starbase can do that a starship can't."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Stocker,,"If I may say so, Captain, I am now quite aware of what a starship can do with the right man at the helm."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,,McCoy enters,
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"You're looking good, Doc."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Mccoy,,"Feeling fine. So is Scotty. The serum worked. He pulled a muscle during the reaction, but otherwise he's feeling fine."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,And yourself?
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Mccoy,,"Oh, very well. A few bruises here and there. Oh. Anytime you're ready, Mister Spock."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Spock,,"I am quite ready now, Doctor."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Mccoy,,"Because of your Vulcan physique, I have prepared an extremely potent shot for you. However, you might like to know I've removed all the breakables from Sickbay."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Spock,,"That is very considerate of you, Doctor."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Mccoy,,I thought you'd be pleased to hear that.
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,,"Spock, McCoy and Stocker leave as Wallace enters.",
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,"Well, gentlemen, all and all, an experience we'll remember in our old age. Which won't be for some while, I hope. Take over, Mister Sulu. Steady as she goes."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Sulu,,"Steady as she goes, Captain."
40,2,The Deadly Years,bridge,Kirk,,I thought I said that.
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,,Spock and McCoy are greeted by a crewman in blue as he walks along.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,Norman,,"Good morning, sir, Doctor."
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,Spock,,Something wrong?
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,Mccoy,,"Yes. There's something odd about that man, and I can't quite pinpoint it."
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,Spock,,Perhaps you're making a rather hasty judgment. Mister Norman has only been aboard seventy two hours.
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,Mccoy,,"I know when something doesn't strike me right, and he doesn't."
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,Spock,,"Specifics, Doctor. Labels do not make arguments."
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,Mccoy,,"All right. There's something wrong about a man who never smiles, whose conversation never varies from the routine of the job, and who won't talk about his background."
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,Spock,,I see.
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,Mccoy,,"Spock, I mean that it's odd for a non-Vulcan. The ears make all the difference."
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,Spock,,I find your argument strewn with gaping defects in logic.
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,Mccoy,,"Maybe, but you can't evaluate a man by logic alone. Besides, he has avoided two appointments that I've made for his physical exam without reason."
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,Spock,,"That's not at all surprising, Doctor. He's probably terrified of your beads and rattles."
41,2,"I, Mudd",auxiliary control,,Norman enters.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",auxiliary control,Jordan,,Command personnel only.
41,2,"I, Mudd",auxiliary control,,"Norman knocks him out and makes changes to the various control panels. A 'Danger, Overload' light comes on.",
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, Mister Sulu?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Sulu,,"There's an unplanned course change being fed into the instruments, sir."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,Correct it.
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Sulu,,"I can't, sir."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,"Auxiliary control, this is the captain. Auxiliary control, what's going on down there?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Sulu,,"Sir, auxiliary control is on total override."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,Kirk to Security.
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Rowe,,"Security. Lieutenant Rowe here, sir."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,"Intruder alert, deck eight, auxiliary control."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Rowe,,Acknowledged.
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant Uhura, have Mister Spock report to the bridge."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,"What's the imposed course, Mister Sulu?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Sulu,,"Turning on three oh seven degrees, mark eight. Being executed now, sir."
41,2,"I, Mudd",auxiliary control,,The three burly security men arrive.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",auxiliary control,Rowe,,Take care of him.
41,2,"I, Mudd",auxiliary control,,The other two leave with the unconscious crewman.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Rowe,,Security to Captain Kirk.
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,Kirk here.
41,2,"I, Mudd",auxiliary control,Rowe,,"Lieutenant Rowe, sir. I'm in auxiliary control. Ensign Jordan's been knocked out."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Rowe,,The directional master controls have been jammed. They're totally unworkable.
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,Any sign of the intruder?
41,2,"I, Mudd",auxiliary control,Rowe,,"No, sir. He's gone. I've put out a full security alert on all decks."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,"Find him. Kirk out. Mister Spock, we seem to be taking an unscheduled ride."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Spock,,Interesting.
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Sulu, cut in emergency manual monitor. I want the override broken."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Sulu,,"Sir, the instruments won't respond."

41,2,"I, Mudd",engineering,,He is pushed against the wall and knocked out briefly. Norman fights everyone that comes at him.,

41,2,"I, Mudd",engineering,Kirk,,What's going on down there? Scotty!
41,2,"I, Mudd",engineering,,Norman has triumphed and is adjusting controls.,

41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,Scotty.
41,2,"I, Mudd",engineering,Kirk,,Scotty.
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,"Scotty? Security, the intruder is in the engineering section. Have all units converge on that point."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Sulu,,"Sir, we're picking up speed. Warp five, six. Warp seven, sir."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,Cut power.
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Sulu,,"I can't, sir. All the controls are jammed."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,"Spock, take over."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Norman,,"It will not be necessary, Captain."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,"Tell Security we've found the intruder. Do you mind telling me what this is all about, mister?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Norman,,I am in total control of your ship. I have connected the matter-antimatter pods to the main navigational bank. A trigger relay is now in operation. Any attempts to alter course will result in immediate destruction of this vessel.
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,Spock?
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Spock,,"Confirmed, Captain. He's taken out all the override controls. If we tamper without knowing where the trigger relay is, we could extinguish ourselves."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,Who are you?
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Norman,,"I assure you we are no threat to humanity or humanoid life. We mean you no harm, but we require your ship."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,You require? Who and what are we?
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,,"Norman lifts his tunic and opens a panel in his abdomen. There are circuit boards, wires and the obligatory flashing lights in there.",
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,An android.
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Spock,,And most sophisticated.
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Norman,,"I control the trigger relay, sir. I cannot be overcome by physical means, and if you attempt to use your phasers, the trigger relay will be activated. We shall continue on our present course for approximately four solar days, at which time we shall arrive at our destination."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,Who sent you?
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Norman,,I am not programmed to respond in that area.
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Spock,attempting a mind meld,"He simply appears to have turned himself off, Captain. And since we cannot repair the damage he has done without destroying the ship"
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,It seems we're going to take a little trip.
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's log. Stardate 4513.3. After having been taken over by an android, the Enterprise has been under way at warp seven for four days. Now we are entering orbit around a planet which has never been charted."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Norman,,"Captain Kirk. The following individuals will be transported down to our planet. Yourself, science officer, medical officer, communications officer and navigator."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,Any meetings or discussions can be held aboard the Enterprise.
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Norman,,"If you do not come with me, your engines will be destroyed and you will remain in orbit here forever."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,I must say that's a gracious invitation.
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Norman,,"There is a word. Among us there is no corresponding meaning, but it seems to mean something to you humans."
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Kirk,,And what is that word?
41,2,"I, Mudd",bridge,Norman,,Please.
41,2,"I, Mudd",cavern,,The required landing party materialise.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",cavern,Norman,,"Our planet's surface is what you classify as K-type, adaptable for humans by use of pressure domes and life-support systems. (to one of two identical women standing by a doorway.) I have brought them."
41,2,"I, Mudd",cavern,Alice 1,,He is waiting.
41,2,"I, Mudd",cavern,Alice 2,,"If you will follow us, please?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,,"There are several other women, all identical to the first two. And seated on the throne - ",
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,I don't believe it.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Welcome aboard, Kirk. It's been a long time, eh?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,Harry Mudd.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Well, to be absolutely accurate, laddybuck, you should refer to me as Mudd the First, ruler of this entire sovereign planet."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"Ruler? Harry, I want control of my ship returned immediately. We have no intention of staying as your guests."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Well, I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem there."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,Alice.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,,Alice reaches out and crushes the communicator.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Now, now, now, now, Jamie boy, let's have no unauthorised communications."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Chekov,,"You know this man, Captain?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"Oh, do I know him. Harcourt Fenton Mudd, thief"
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,Come now.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,Swindler and con man
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,Entrepreneur.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,Liar and rogue.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,Did I leave you with that impression?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"He belongs in jail, which is where I thought I left you, Mudd."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"And thereby hangs a tale, yes. But look around you, Kirk. Quite a place, isn't it? I hope you're all going to enjoy it."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"Mudd, I want that trained machine of yours, Norman, to deactivate the trigger mechanism and free my ship."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"I shall do that, Kirk, when I'm ready."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,I'm telling you now.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"And I do the telling on this planet, Kirk, old boy. You do the listening."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"All right, I'll listen. What are you telling?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Merely that you might as well start enjoying yourselves. It's really a very, very nice place, and you're all going to be here quite probably for the rest of your lives. (laughs)"
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"Harry Mudd, you're a liar and an outlaw and in deep trouble. I want navigational control restored, my ship released."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Sorry. That'd be against the law. My law. Decreed by Mudd the First. Voted in by the resident population. Lovely, aren't they? You must admit, Kirk, that I still retain my eye for beauty. I decreed that I should always be surrounded by it, and my decrees always come to pass. I've had five hundred of them made up to attend me. All of them identical, beautiful, compliant, obedient."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Spock,,Five hundred of the same model? That seems rather redundant.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"I have a fondness for this particular model, Mister Spock, which you, unfortunately, are ill-equipped to appreciate."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"All right, Harry, explain. How did you get here? We left you in custody after that affair on the Rigel mining planet."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Yes, well, I organised a technical information service bringing modern industrial techniques to backward planets, making available certain valuable patents to struggling young civilisations throughout the galaxy."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,Did you pay royalties to the owners of those patents?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Well, actually, Kirk, as a defender of the free enterprise system, I found myself in a rather ambiguous conflict as a matter of principle."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Spock,,He did not pay royalties.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Knowledge, sir, should be free to all."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,Who caught you?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"That, sir, is an outrageous assumption."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,Yes. Who caught you?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,I sold the Denebians all the rights to a Vulcan fuel synthesiser.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,And the Denebians contacted the Vulcans.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,How'd you know?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,That's what I would have done.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,It's typical police mentality. They've got no sense of humour. They arrested me.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mccoy,,"Oh, I find that shocking."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,Worse than that. Do know what the penalty for fraud is on Deneb Five?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Spock,,"The guilty party has his choice. Death by electrocution, death by gas, death by phaser, death by hanging."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"The key word in your entire peroration, Mister Spock, was, death. Barbarians. Well, of course, I left."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,He broke jail.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,I borrowed transportation.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,He stole a spaceship.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,The patrol reacted in a hostile manner.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,They fired at him.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"They've no respect for private property. They damaged the bloody spaceship. Well, I got away, but I couldn't navigate, so I wandered out through unmapped space, and here I found Mudd."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Spock,,"You went to substantial risk and effort to bring a starship here. Logically, you must have a compelling motive."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Spock, you're going to love it here. They all talk just the way you do."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"Go on, get on with it, Harry."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Yes, well, right, laddybuck. So here I am in a planet with over two hundred thousand hard-working, happy androids, all of whom exist merely to serve my every whim. It's absolute paradise."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Spock,,Then I'm unable to discern your problem.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,They won't let me go. They want to study me. They want to learn more about human beings.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,They picked a fine representative.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Watch your tongue, lad. You're talking about Mudd the First. Well, anyway, I ran out of ideas. I simply ran out of things for them to do, and they insisted that I bring them more human beings. They need human beings to serve, to study. So I had to promise them a prime sample. A starship captain. Bright, loyal, fearless and imaginative. Any captain would have done. I was lucky to get you. So you are going to take over for me here, and I can get off this rock and back to civilisation."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"I think not, Harry."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"You misunderstand me, lad. I'm not asking you. I'm telling you. You've no choice. Show them to their quarters."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Norman And Alices,,"Yes, my Lord Mudd."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Alice,,"This way, please."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mccoy,noticing a curtained alcove,"Harry, what's this?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Ah. That, gentlemen, is a shrine to the memory of my beloved Stella."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,Who?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Stella, my wife."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,,Revealing a woman of sour features.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mccoy,,Dead?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Oh, no, no, no. Merely deserted. You see, gentlemen, behind every great man there is a woman urging him on. And so it was with my Stella. She urged me on into outer space. Not that she meant to, but with her continual, eternal, confounded nagging. Well, I think of her constantly, and every time I do, I go further out into space."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mccoy,,That's very interesting. You leave your wife and then bring her along.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"I had the androids construct a perfect replica of Stella so that I could gaze upon her and rejoice in her absence. Gentlemen, attend. Stella, dear."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Stella,,"Harcourt. Harcourt Fenton Mudd, what have you been up to? Nothing good, I'm sure. Well, let me tell you, you lazy, good-for-nothing"
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,Shut up.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Stella,,"Nothing, thing, thing,"
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Marvellous, isn't it? I finally have the last word with her, and with you."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,,Norman and the Alices lead the landing party to a place with couches and plants.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Norman,,You'll find this quite comfortable. Your quarters are down the hall.

41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"Norman, who created you?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Norman,,The makers designed us. They came from the galaxy of Andromeda.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Mccoy,,Then your makers weren't humanoid?
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Norman,,"They were, as you say, quite humanoid, but, unlike your civilisation, robots were common. We performed the necessary service functions and freed our makers to evolve a perfect social order."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,What became of them?
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Norman,,"Our home planet's sun became a nova. Only a few exploratory outposts survived. This unit, myself, was part of one such outpost in your galaxy."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,Then some of your makers survive.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Norman,,"No, Captain. They died over the stretch of time."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Spock,,Whom do you serve now?
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,All,,We serve Harry Mudd.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Alice 2,,He has given us purpose again.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Alice 1,,It is necessary to have purpose.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Norman,,We lacked it for a long time. (he leaves)
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Alice 1,,We have a very extensive library section for your amusement.

41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Both,,Why should we leave you?

41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Mccoy,,I think Mister Chekov's right. We are in a lot of trouble.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,Spock. And if you say we're in a lot of trouble.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Spock,,"We are, and we must direct our attack to the heart of the matter. Obviously this many androids cannot operate independently. There must be a central control system which guides the entire android population."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"Try and find it. The rest of you, look around, learn everything you can. I'll see what else I can find out from Mister Mudd. Let's go."

41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Norman,,"Two hundred and seven thousand, eight hundred and nine."
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Spock,,This would seem to be a simple relay centre. Are all of you controlled through this device?

41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"Scotty, you were ordered to stay aboard."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Scott,,"Aye, sir. And I stayed until that female gargantua threw me into the transporter beams."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"What does she mean, the last one?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Mudd,,"Didn't I tell you, Kirk? I beamed a few dozen androids up to your ship. They've been sending your crew to the surface for the past couple of hours. They're all down now."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,Are you out of your mind? (grabs Mudd by the throat) You can't beam down an entire crew of a spaceship. Somebody has to be on board.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Mudd,,"There is an entire crew aboard. An entire crew of androids. They learn very quickly, Captain. The fact is, I've taken over your whole ship. There's nothing you can do about it."

41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Spock,,"He could successfully accomplish it, Captain. I've questioned a number of the androids, and they're totally loyal to Mudd. Perhaps of more concern is the fact that this android population can literally provide anything a human being could ask for in unlimited quantity."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"Yes, I know. That's what worries me. How will my crew react in a world where they can have everything they want simply by asking for it."

41,2,"I, Mudd",laboratory,Norman,,"You may command us to make anything for you, or do the work yourself for pleasure. You may have the services of any number of craftsmen, exclusive use of the computer facilities. Anything."
41,2,"I, Mudd",laboratory,,Mudd and Kirk enter.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",laboratory,Scott,,"Captain, you should see this shop! Why, they have facilities we've never even thought of."
41,2,"I, Mudd",laboratory,Kirk,,"Is that the way you're going to do it, Mudd? Hit my people at their weakest point?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",laboratory,Norman,,"We only wish to make you happy and comfortable, Captain. If we are to serve your kind, we must understand you. Our Lord, Harry Mudd was only one example for us. Now we are learning a great deal from all of you."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"All right, here we are, birds in a gilded cage. The question is, how do we get out of here?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Chekov,,"I don't know, sir, but it's a very nice gilded cage."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Uhura,,"And it is a very pleasant place, Captain."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Scott,,"What did they offer you, Uhura?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Uhura,,"Oh, nothing really important. Just immortality."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"All right. We're getting back to the ship, and don't you forget it. Straighten up! This may be a gilded cage filled with everything you always wanted, but it's still a cage. We don't belong here. We belong on that ship up there."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Alice 471,,"Do you require something, lord?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,No. Yes. My ship.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Alice 471,,I am not programmed
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Alice And Kirk,,To respond in that area.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"Yes, I know."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Alice 471,,Is there anything any of you require to please you?
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"Alice, give us back our ship to please us. Return us to our ship because we desire it."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Alice 471,,We are programmed to serve. We shall serve you to your best interests to make you happy.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,But we're unhappy here.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Alice 471,,Please explain unhappy.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Spock,,Unhappiness is the state which occurs in the human when wants and desires are not fulfilled.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Alice 471,,Which wants and desires of yours are not fulfilled?
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,We want the Enterprise.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,,Alice's label flashes.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Alice 471,,The Enterprise is not a want or a desire. It is a mechanical device.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"No, it's a beautiful lady, and we love her."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Alice 471,,"Illogical. Illogical. All units relate. All units. Norman, co-ordinate. Unhappiness does not relate. We must study this."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,,She leaves.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,Interesting.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Spock,,Fascinating.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"Bones, have you had time to take any psychological readings of the androids?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Mccoy,,"I did. And you can forget it. They're perfect, flawless, mentally and physically. No weaknesses, perfectly disciplined. No vices, no fears, no faults. Just a sense of purpose. Believe me, there's nothing tougher to overcome, even among humans."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"Yes. That's what this crew needs, a little sense of purpose."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"Mudd, a few questions I want to ask you."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Afraid I won't have time to answer them. My bags are all packed. The androids will take the Enterprise out of orbit in less than twenty four hours. But it's been a real pleasure having you here, Kirk. Is there anything I can get for you?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,Yes. My ship.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"You're a stubborn fellow, aren't you? But I don't mind. I don't mind that at all. Because I'll be leaving here quickly enough, and then you can be stubborn at your own leisure. One last time. Stella, dear."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Stella,,"Harcourt Fenton Mudd, where have you been? What have you been up to? Have you been drinking again, you miserable sot! You good-for-nothing"
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,Shut up!
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Stella,,"Thing, thing, thing."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Alice Number 2, my little love. Will you have my bags transported up to the ship?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Androids,,"No, my Lord Mudd."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,What?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Norman,,"We can no longer take your orders, Harry Mudd."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,Why not?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Norman,,Our makers were wise. They programmed us to serve.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Yes, but that's what I'm saying. Put my bags on the ship."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"Harry, I think they have something else in mind."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Norman,,"You are correct, Captain. Harry Mudd is flawed, even for a human being. We recognised this from the beginning but used his knowledge to obtain more specimens. Your species is self-destructive. You need our help."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"We prefer to help ourselves. We make mistakes, but we're human. And maybe that's the word that best explains us."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Norman,,"We will not harm you, but we will take the starship, and you will remain on this planet."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Now, look here. You can't do that! Now, listen. To serve us, you must obey us."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Androids,,"No, my Lord Mudd."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Alice number One, obey me. Put my bags on that ship!"
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,,She gives him a gentle push and he goes reeling backwards until he falls.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Norman,,We cannot allow any race as greedy and corruptible as yours to have free run of the galaxy.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Spock,,"I'm curious, Norman. Just how do you intend to stop them?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Norman,,We shall serve them. Their kind will be eager to accept our service. Soon they will become completely dependent upon us.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Alice 99,,Their aggressive and acquisitive instincts will be under our control.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Norman,,We shall take care of them.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Spock,,Eminently practical.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,The whole galaxy controlled by your kind?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Norman,,"Yes, Captain. And we shall serve them and you will be happy, and controlled."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"So far this thing has had its amusing aspects, but that threat the androids made about taking over all the humans in the galaxy is not very funny."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Spock,,"Indeed, it is not. They may quite possibly be able to accomplish it."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Mudd,,"Take my word for it, they can."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Spock,,"Whatever method we use to stop them, we must make haste. They have only to install some cybernetic devices aboard the Enterprise and they'll be able to leave orbit."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Mccoy,,How do you know so much?
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Spock,,I asked them.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Mccoy,,Oh.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,Why shouldn't they answer our questions? They don't think we can do anything to stop them.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Mudd,,"You're so smart, Kirk, you and this pointy-eared thinking machine of yours. Well, you'd better do something because I'm as anxious to get off this ruddy rock as you are."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Mccoy,,You wanted to leave us on this ruddy rock and leave by yourself.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Mudd,,"Oh, yes."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"All right, what have we got to work with?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Scott,,"Well, Captain, androids and robots, they're just not capable of independent, creative thought."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Spock,,Yet the device that Norman claims to be their central control is totally inadequate to the task of directing more than two hundred thousand of them.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,I agree. What in your opinion does direct them?
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Spock,,"There are a large number of Alices and Trudies, Maisies, Annabels, and according to my research, a Herman series, an Oscar series, a whole plethora of series in fact. But only one Norman."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"Norman. When I told one of the Alices that the Enterprise was a lovely lady and we loved her, she said, Norman, co-ordinate. Why Norman? Unless"
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Spock,,"To function as they do, each android mind must be one component of a mass brain linked through a central locus."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"Named Norman. Forming one gigantic, highly intelligent mind. And the glowing badges, they indicate the mind in operation."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Spock,,That would seem logical.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"Yes, logical. That's what it is. And that in turn gives us a weapon that we can use against them. We must use wild, insane, irrational illogic aimed right at Norman!"
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Mudd,,"Captain, you sing and dance as well as anyone I've ever seen, but what the devil are you talking about?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Spock,,"What would seem to be a sound, and perhaps our only, opportunity."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Mudd,,"Opportunity? Now, listen, Spock, you may be a wonderful science officer, but believe me, you couldn't sell fake patents to your mother."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Spock,,I fail to understand why I should care to induce my mother to purchase falsified patents.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Mudd,,Forget it.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"Let's get to the point. Harry, you said you wanted to help. Do you?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Mudd,,"Captain, the kind of a wholesome, antiseptic galaxy that these androids would run would be purgatory for a man like me."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"That's fine, Harry. The androids will be expecting us to make a break for it, and that's where you come in."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Mudd,,What can I do?
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"Nothing, Harry. Just go to sleep."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Mudd,,"What do you mean? (McCoy produces a hypo) Oh, now, now wait a minute, gentlemen. No, what I, I, (gets injected) had in mind was actually more in the line of a few words of sage counsel as it were. Advice (passes out in Kirk and Scott's arms)"
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"Oh, Harry. I do believe you're putting on weight."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Alice 1,,Yes.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"We have a medical problem. Your ex-Lord, Harry Mudd."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Alice 1,,He is human. You will have to care for him.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"We are caring for him, but our doctor needs his medical equipment aboard the Enterprise."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Alice 1,,The starship is forbidden to humans.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"You are programmed to serve. If we're not allowed access to our medical equipment, Harry Mudd will die. He will cease to function. You will have failed to serve."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Alice 1,,I am directed to observe the situation.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Alice 1,,He is malfunctioning?
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Mccoy,,He is dying.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Alice 1,,"If you take him to your Sickbay, will he be repaired?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"Oh, yes."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Uhura,,"No, they're lying. It's a trick. Doctor McCoy injected something into Harry Mudd to make him look sick. It's a trick to get back on board and sabotage the ship."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Alice 1,,Your request is refused.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"Uhura, why did you tell her?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Uhura,,"Because I want an android body. I want immortality. I'll live forever, Captain. I'll be young and beautiful."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Alice 1,,You have been of assistance. We shall fulfill our obligation.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Uhura,,Thank you.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Alice 1,,The programming for your body will be completed before we leave.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,,Alice leaves,
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,Uhura. Beautiful!
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Uhura,,I half believed it myself.
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Narrator,,"SCOTT; Well, the androids were expecting an attempt, and now we've made it."
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Chekov,,"What's next, Captain?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",living area,Kirk,,"Next, we take the Alices on a trip through Wonderland."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Alice 118+2,,Do you require something?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,Yes. Your attention.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,,"Scott and McCoy enter, bow to each other and then start playing imaginary flute and fiddle while Chekov and Uhura waltz.",
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Alice 2,,What are they doing?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,They're celebrating.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Alice 118,,What are they celebrating?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,Their captivity. Do you enjoy the music?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Alice 118,,Music?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Alice 2,,Music?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,,Their badges start flashing.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Chekov,,"Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, lovely lady. You dance divinely."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Uhura,,"Thank you, kind sir. (her slap knocks him off his feet.)"
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Alice 2,,Why does she strike him?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,She likes him. Mister Chekov. The floor is no place for an officer. Attention! Now stand absolutely still.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Chekov,,"Yes, Captain. (and goes into an energetic Cossack dance)"
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"That's better, Mister Chekov."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Alice 118,,It is illogical.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,Your statement is illogical.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,,The flashes become a continual light.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Scott,,How does it look?
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mccoy,,Completely inner directed. Oblivious to everything.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,Good. I wonder how Spock's doing.
41,2,"I, Mudd",laboratory,Spock,,Of course. Your computations would inevitably lead to a total description of the parabolic intersection of dimension with dimension.
41,2,"I, Mudd",laboratory,Alice 27,,"Mister Spock, you have a remarkably logical and analytical mind."
41,2,"I, Mudd",laboratory,Spock,,Thank you.
41,2,"I, Mudd",laboratory,,He attempts a neck pinch on Alice 210.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",laboratory,Alice 210,,Is there some significance to this action?
41,2,"I, Mudd",laboratory,Spock,,"I love you. However, I hate you."
41,2,"I, Mudd",laboratory,Alice 210,,But I'm identical in every way with Alice Twenty Seven.
41,2,"I, Mudd",laboratory,Spock,,"Yes, of course. That is exactly why I hate you. Because you are identical."
41,2,"I, Mudd",laboratory,,They go out of action.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",laboratory,Spock,,Fascinating.
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,Mccoy,,"All right, it's worked so far, but we're not out yet."
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,Kirk,,Well?
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,Spock,,"Success, Captain. We've been pruning the leaves and branches of the tree. Now it is time to get to work on the root."
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,Kirk,,"If Norman is the control centre, he should be in a bind by what we've done. If we can overload him further, we should be able to immobilise all of them. Does everybody remember what to do?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,Spock,,Affirmative.
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,All,,"Aye, sir."
41,2,"I, Mudd",corridor,Kirk,,Acknowledged.
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Norman,,What are you doing here?
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Kirk,,I want you to surrender.
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Norman,,That is illogical. We can move more quickly than you. We are invulnerable to attack. We are much stronger.
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Kirk,,"No, we are stronger. I'll prove it to you. Can you harm a man that you're programmed to serve?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Norman,,No.
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Mudd,,"But you already have, Norman, laddy. Human beings do not survive on bread alone, you poor soulless creature, but on the nourishments of liberty, for what indeed is a man without freedom? Naught but a mechanism trapped in the cogwheels of eternity."
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Mccoy,in a monotone,You offer us only well-being.
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Scott,in a monotone,Food and drink and happiness mean nothing to us. We must be about our job.
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Mccoy,,"Suffering, in torment and pain. Labouring without end."
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Scott,,Dying and crying and lamenting over our burdens.
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Both,,Only this way can we be happy.
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,,Then they curtsey.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Norman,,That is contradictory. It is not logical. Mister Spock. Explain.
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Kirk,,Why not?
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Spock,,Logic is a little tweeting bird chirping in a meadow. Logic is a wreath of pretty flowers which smell bad. Are you sure your circuits are registering correctly? Your ears are green.
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Scott,clutching at his heart and crying out in anguish,I canna go on! I'm tired of happiness. I'm tired of comfort and pleasure. I'm ready! Kill me! Kill me!
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,,They point their fingers at him and whistle. Scott slumps to his knees.,

41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Norman,,You cannot have killed him. You have no weapons.
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Kirk,,"Scotty. Scotty's dead. He had too much happiness. But now he's happier he's dead, and we'll miss him. Let us hear it for our poor, dead friend."
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,,They laugh.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Kirk,,"What is a man but that lofty spirit, that sense of enterprise, that devotion to something that cannot be sensed, cannot be realised but only dreamed! The highest reality."
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Mudd,,"Brilliant! Bravo, bravo, Captain!"
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Kirk,,How did you like it?
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Norman,,That is irrational. Illogical. Dreams are not real.
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Kirk,,"Our logic is to be illogical. That is our advantage. Mister Spock, it is time. The explosive."
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Spock,,"Very well, Captain."
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,,He removes an invisible package from under his tunic.,

41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Narrator,,"Mister Spock, isn't that too much for our purposes?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Spock,,"I believe that is the correct amount, Captain. Mister Mudd, are you ready?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Mudd,,"Aye, aye! (adopts a catchers pose)"
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Spock,,Be careful. I would not want you to drop it.

41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Mudd,,I lied.
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Norman,,What?
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Kirk,,He lied. Everything Harry tells you is a lie. Remember that. Everything Harry tells you is a lie.
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Mudd,,"Listen to this carefully, Norman. I am lying."
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Norman,,"You say you are lying, but if everything you say is a lie then you are telling the truth, but you cannot tell the truth because everything you say is a lie. You lie. You tell the truth. But you cannot for. Illogical! Illogical! Please explain."
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,,Smoke comes out of Norman's head.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Norman,,You are human. Only humans can explain their behaviour. Please explain.

41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Mudd,,"Kirk, old man, I'm beginning to develop considerable respect for you."
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Kirk,,"Why, thank you."
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Mudd,,Would you consider entering a partnership arrangement with me? I've got some ideas.
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Kirk,,A partnership arrangement? You and me?
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Mudd,,Yes.
41,2,"I, Mudd",computer area,Kirk,,I've got something else in mind. Let's go.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,,Different androids are standing around the walls. Two pairs are wearing costumes from 'Mudd's Women'.,
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mccoy,,"Well, you must be very unhappy, Mister Spock."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Spock,,"That is a human emotion, Doctor, with which I am totally unfamiliar. How could I be unhappy?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mccoy,,"Well, we found a whole world of minds that work just like yours. Logical, unemotional, completely pragmatic. And we poor, irrational humans whipped them in a fair fight. Now you'll find yourself back among us illogical humans again."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Spock,,"Which I find eminently satisfactory, Doctor, for nowhere am I so desperately needed as among a shipload of illogical humans."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"Touché, Bones."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,I've never heard of anything so revolting. We'll soon get to the bottom of this.

41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"Kirk, now what's this I hear about my having to stay here?"
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"Yes, Mudd, you've been paroled to the android population of this planet."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Spock,,The androids are being reprogrammed. Their original purpose was to adapt this planet for productive use. They'll begin that work again.
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Mudd,,"But what do I do? Kirk, I'm no scientist."
41,2,"I, Mudd",throne room,Kirk,,"No, you're an irritant. You'll stay here and provide a first-class example to the androids of a human failure. They'll learn by close observation how to avoid ones like you in the future."

42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,corridor,Kirk,,"Yes, Mister Baris. What can I do for you?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Baris,,"Kirk, this station is swarming with Klingons."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,corridor,Kirk,,"I was not aware, Mister Baris, that twelve Klingons constitutes a swarm."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Baris,,"Captain Kirk, there are Klingon soldiers on this station. Now, I want you to keep that grain safe."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,corridor,Kirk,,"Mister Baris, I have guards around the grain. I have guards around the Klingons. The only reason those guards are there is because Starfleet wants them there. As for what you want (pauses at a look from Spock) It has been noted and logged. Kirk out."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,corridor,Spock,,"Captain, may I ask where you'll be?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,corridor,Kirk,,Sickbay with a headache.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,,There are eleven fluffy tribbles of various sizes and colour in a large container.,
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Hi, Jim."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Kirk,,"Bones, what have you got for a headache?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Mccoy,,Let me guess. Klingons? Baris?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Kirk,,Both. How many of these did Uhura give you?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Mccoy,,Just one.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Kirk,,"But you've got, er, eleven."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Mccoy,,"You noticed that, huh? Here. This ought to take care of it."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Kirk,,How do they? How do they?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I haven't figured that out yet, but I can tell you this much. Almost fifty percent of the creature's metabolism is geared for reproduction. Do you know what you get if you feed a tribble too much?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Kirk,,A fat tribble.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Mccoy,,No. You get a bunch of hungry little tribbles.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Kirk,,"Well, Bones, all I can suggest is you open up a maternity ward."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,transporter room,Kirk,,All you men going on shore leave to stay in groups. Avoid trouble with the Klingons.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,transporter room,Scott,,"I'll tell them before they go, sir."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,transporter room,Kirk,,"Aren't you going on shore leave, Scotty?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,transporter room,Scott,,"Why, no, sir."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,transporter room,Kirk,,I want you to go on shore leave. Make sure that everybody stays out of trouble.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,transporter room,Scott,,"But, Captain. Aye, sir."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,transporter room,Kirk,,"Scotty, enjoy yourself."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,,"Business is good. Scott, Chekov and Freeman take the last vacant table. Two security men leave and Jones enters, whistling.",
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Jones,,"Ah, friend. Can I offer you a charming little tribble?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Scott,,"Uh, no, thanks."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Jones,,Oh. Perhaps one of you other gents?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,,No reply,
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Jones,,"Ah, friend Klingon. Can I interest you in a harmless tribble?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,,The tribble screeches.,
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Korax,,Get it away from me.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Jones,,I'm sorry. I can't understand it. I've never seen them act this way before.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Korax,,Get out of here with that parasite.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Jones,,He's only a harmless little
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Korax,,Take it away!
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Jones,,"Yes. Ah, my good friend. How would you like to enter another little transaction? This time, a tribble for a spot"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Barman,,A tribble.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Jones,,Indeed.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Barman,starts producing tribbles from all over the place and putting them on the bar,A tribble?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,,The pretty lady in yellow brings our group their drinks.,
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Scott,,"When are you going to get off that milk diet, lad?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Chekov,,This is vodka.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Scott,,"Where I come from, that's soda pop. This is a drink for a man."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Chekov,,Scotch?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Scott,,Aye.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Chekov,,It was invented by a little old lady from Leningrad.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,,Korax goes over to the bar and shares his drink with Jones.,
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Korax,,"The Earthers like those fuzzy things, don't they?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Jones,,"Oh, yes."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Klingon,,"Frankly, I never liked Earthers. They remind me of Regulan blood worms."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Chekov,,That Cossack.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Scott,,"Easy, lad. You ought to be more forgiving."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Korax,,"No. I just remembered. There is one Earthman who doesn't remind me of a Regulan blood worm. That's Kirk. A Regulan blood worm is soft and shapeless, but Kirk isn't soft. Kirk may be a swaggering, overbearing, tin-plated dictator with delusions of godhood, but he's not soft."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,,Chekov leaps to his feet,
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Scott,,"Take it easy, lad. Everybody's entitled to an opinion."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Korax,,"That's right, and if I think that Kirk is a Denebian slime devil, well that's my opinion too."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Scott,,"Don't do it, mister, and that's an order."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Chekov,,You heard what he called the captain.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Scott,,"Forget it. It's not worth fighting for. We're big enough to take a few insults. Now, drink your drink."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,,swaps Chekov's vodka for Freeman's red wine.,
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Korax,,"Of course, I'd say that Captain Kirk deserves his ship. We like the Enterprise. We, we really do. That sagging old rust bucket is designed like a garbage scow. Half the quadrant knows it. That's why they're learning to speak Klingonese."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Chekov,,Mister Scott!
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Scott,,"Laddie, don't you think you should rephrase that?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Korax,,"You're right, I should. I didn't mean to say that the Enterprise should be hauling garbage. I meant to say that it should be hauled away as garbage."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,,"There's a fight, of course. Scott's first right cross sends Korax flying over a table. After that, it's the Klingons versus Starfleet, with the barman beating a retreat and Jones taking the opportunity to help himself to drinks from the dispensing machine. Finally he decides to leave with his spoils and is about to enjoy his last glass when the Security guards rush in followed by the Barman, who takes the glass just before it reaches Jones' lips. So he takes another out of his pocket instead.",
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, stardate 4525.6. A small disturbance between the Klingon crew and members of the Enterprise crew has broken out aboard Space Station K7. I am forced to cancel shore leave for both ships."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,,Ten men are lined up. Chekov has a nice bruise on his cheek.,
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,"I want to know who started it. I'm waiting. Freeman, who started the fight?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Freeman,,"I don't know, sir."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,"All right. Chekov. I know you. You started it, didn't you?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Chekov,,"No, sir, I didn't."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,Who did?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Chekov,,"I don't know, sir."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,"I don't know, sir. I want to know who threw the first punch. All right. You're all confined to quarters until I find out who started it. Dismissed. (the men file out) Scotty, not you. You were supposed to prevent trouble, Mister Scott."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Scott,,"Aye, Captain."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,"Who threw the first punch, Scotty?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Scott,,Um.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,Mister Scott?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Scott,,"I did, Captain."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,"You did, Mister Scott? What caused it, Scotty?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Scott,,"They insulted us, sir."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,Must have been some insult.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Scott,,"Aye, it was."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,You threw the first punch.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Scott,,"Aye. Chekov wanted to, but I held him back."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,You held? Why did Chekov want to start a fight?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Scott,,"Well, the Klingon, sir. Is this off the record?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,"No, this is not off the record."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Scott,,"Well, Captain, the Klingons called you, uh a tin-plated, overbearing, swaggering dictator with delusions of godhood."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,Is that all?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Scott,,"No, sir. They also compared you with a Denebian slime devil."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,I see.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Scott,,And then they said you
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,"I get the picture, Scotty."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Scott,,"Yes, sir."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,"After they said all this, that's when you hit the Klingons?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Scott,,"No, sir."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,No?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Scott,,"No, I didn't. You told us to avoid trouble."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,"Oh, yes."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Scott,,"And I didn't see that it was worth fighting about. After all, we're big enough to take a few insults. Aren't we?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,What was it they said that started the fight?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Scott,,"They called the Enterprise a garbage scow, sir."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,I see. And that's when you hit the Klingons?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Scott,,"Yes, sir."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,"You hit the Klingons because they insulted the Enterprise, not because they"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Scott,,"Well, sir, this was a matter of pride."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Kirk,,"All right, Scotty. Dismissed. Scotty, you're restricted to quarters until further notice."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,briefing room,Scott,big grin,"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. That'll give me a chance to catch up on my technical journals."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,,There are a lot more than eleven tribbles now.,
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Mccoy,,"What's the matter, Spock?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Spock,,There's something disquieting about these creatures.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Mccoy,,Don't tell me you've got a feeling.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Spock,,"Don't be insulting, Doctor. They remind me of the lilies of the field. They toil not, neither do they spin. But they seem to eat a great deal. I see no practical use for them."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Does everything have to have a practical use for you? They're nice, soft, and furry, and they make a pleasant sound."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Spock,,"So would an ermine violin, but I see no advantage in having one."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Mccoy,,"It's a human characteristic to love little animals, especially if they're attractive in some way."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Spock,,"Doctor, I am well aware of human characteristics. I am frequently inundated by them, but I've trained myself to put up with practically anything."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Spock, I don't know too much about these little tribbles yet, but there's one thing that I have discovered."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Spock,,"What is that, Doctor?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Mccoy,,I like them better than I like you.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Spock,,Doctor?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Mccoy,,Yes?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Spock,,They do have one redeeming characteristic.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Mccoy,,What's that?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,sickbay,Spock,,"They do not talk too much. If you'll excuse me, sir."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,,"Kirk walks to his chair, preoccupied by his last conversation. When he sits, there is a squeak. He has sat on a large tribble. Then he notices that there are fluffy balls everywhere.",
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Kirk,,"Doctor McCoy, would you mind coming up to the bridge? (he takes a walk around then) Lieutenant Uhura, how did all these tribbles get on the bridge?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Uhura,,"I don't know, sir. They do seem to be all over the ship."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,,"McCoy enters, stroking a tribble.",
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Kirk,,Doctor McCoy.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Mccoy,,"Yes? Did you want to see me, Jim? Don't look at me. It's the tribbles who are breeding. If we don't get them off this ship, we're going to be hip deep in them."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Kirk,,Explain that.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Mccoy,,"The nearest thing I can figure out is they're born pregnant, which seems to be quite a time saver."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Kirk,,"I know, but really"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Mccoy,,"And from my observations, it seems they're bisexual, reproducing at will. And, brother, have they got a lot of will."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, I am forced to agree with the doctor. I've been running computations on their rate of reproduction. The figures are taking an alarming direction. They're consuming our supplies and returning nothing."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Uhura,,"But they do give us something, Mister Spock. They give us love. Well, Cyrano Jones says a tribble is the only love that money can buy."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Kirk,,"Too much of anything, Lieutenant, even love, isn't necessarily a good thing."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, Captain."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Kirk,,"Get the maintenance crew to clean up the entire ship, and then contact Mister Lurry and tell him I'm beaming down."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, aye."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Kirk,,Have him find Cyrano Jones and hold him.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Uhura,,Aye.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Kirk,,And get these tribbles off the bridge.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, aye, Captain."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Jones,,"Captain Kirk, I'm mystified at your tone of voice. I've done nothing to warrant such severe treatment."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,"Oh, really?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Spock,,Surely you must have realised what would happen if you removed the tribbles from their predator-filled environment into an environment where their natural multiplicative proclivities would have no restraining factors.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Jones,,Of course. What did you say?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Spock,,"By removing the tribbles from their natural habitat, you have, so to speak, removed the cork from the bottle and allowed the genie to escape."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Jones,,"If by that, you mean do they breed quickly? Of course, that's how I maintain my stock. Breeding animals is not against regulations, only breeding dangerous ones. And tribbles are not dangerous."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,Just incredibly prolific.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Jones,,"Precisely, and at six credits a head, well, that is, a body, it mounts up. Now if you'll excuse me."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,You should sell an instruction and maintenance manual for this thing.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Jones,,"If I did, what would happen to man's search for knowledge? Well, I must be tending my ship. Au revoir."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,,He meets Baris and Darvin at the door.,
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Darvin,,"Go ahead, sir. Tell him."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Baris,,"Captain Kirk, I consider your security measures a disgrace. In my opinion, you have taken this important project far too lightly."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,"On the contrary, sir. I think of this project as very important. It is you I take lightly."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Baris,,I am going to report fully to the proper authorities that you have given free and complete access to this station to a man who is quite probably a Klingon agent.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,That's a serious charge. To whom are you referring?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Baris,,To that man who just walked out of here.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,"Cyrano Jones, a Klingon agent?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Baris,,You heard me.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,I heard you.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Spock,,He simply could not believe his ears.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,What evidence do you have against Mister Jones?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Baris,,"My assistant here has kept Mister Jones under close surveillance for quite some time, and his actions have been most suspicious. I believe he was involved in that little altercation between your men and the men from"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,"Yes, yes. Go on. What else do you have?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Darvin,,"Well Captain, I've checked his ship's log, and it seems that he was within the Klingon's sphere of influence less than four months ago."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Baris,,"The man is an independent scout, Captain. It is quite possible he is also a Klingon spy."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Spock,,"We have already checked on the background of Mister Cyrano Jones. He is a licensed asteroid locator and prospector. He's never broken the law, at least not severely. For the past seven years, with his one-man spaceship, he's obtained a marginal living by engaging in the buying and selling of rare merchandise, including, unfortunately, tribbles."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Baris,,But he is after my grain!
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,Do you have any proof of that?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Darvin,,You can't deny he's disrupted this station.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,"People have disrupted stations before without being Klingon agents. Sometimes, all they need is a title, Mister Baris. Unfortunately, disrupting a space station is not an offence. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a ship to tend to. Au revoir."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,rec room,,"There are tribbles on the walls, the floor, the tables, even as chess pieces. Kirk gets a tray from the food dispenser. It has tribbles on it.",
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,rec room,Kirk,,My chicken sandwich and coffee. This is my chicken sandwich and coffee.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,rec room,Spock,,Fascinating.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,rec room,Kirk,,"I want these off the ship. I don't care if it takes every man we've got, I want them off the ship."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,rec room,,"Scott enters, carrying an armful of fluff.",
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,rec room,Scott,,"They're into the machinery, all right, and they're probably in all the other food processors too."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,rec room,Kirk,,How?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,rec room,Scott,,Probably through one of the air vents.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,rec room,Spock,,"Captain, there are vents of that type on the space station."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,rec room,Kirk,,"And in the storage compartments. (goes to a table monitor) This is Kirk. Contact Manager Lurry and Nilz Baris. Have them meet us near the storage compartments. We're beaming down. Come on, Spock."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,transporter room,,The tribbles are all over the pads too. Kirk picks one up but there's nowhere else to put it.,
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,transporter room,Kirk,,Energise.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Lurry,,What's wrong?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,"Plenty, if what I think's happened has happened."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Kirk,,Is that door secure?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Guard,,"Yes, sir. Nothing could get in."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Kirk,,Good. Open it.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Guard,,"It's not working, sir. It seems to be stuck."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Kirk,,Here. Let me try it.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,,"But he can't open it either, so he tried one of the overhead doors instead. That does open, and a whole load of tribbles fall out, burying the gallant Captain up to his shoulders. Spock examines one.",
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Spock,,They seem to be gorged.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Baris,,"Gorged? On my grain? Kirk, I am going to hold you responsible. There must be thousands of them."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Kirk,,Hundreds of thousands.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Spock,,"One million seven hundred seventy one thousand five hundred sixty one. That's assuming one tribble, multiplying with an average litter of ten, producing a new generation every twelve hours over a period of three days."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Kirk,,That's assuming they got here three days ago.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Spock,,And allowing for the amount of grain consumed and the volume of the storage compartment.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Baris,,"Kirk, you should have known. You are responsible for turning the development project into a total disaster."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Kirk,,Mister Baris
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Baris,,"And I'm through being intimidated, Kirk. You have insulted me, you have ignored me, you've walked all over me. You have abused your authority, and you've rejected my requests. And this, this is the result. I'm going to hold you responsible."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Kirk,,"Mister Baris, I'll hold you in irons if you don't shut up."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Mccoy,,"Jim, I think I've got it. All we have to do is quit feeding them. We quit feeding them, they stop breeding."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Kirk,,Now he tells me.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Spock,,Captain this tribble is dead. And so are these.

42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Spock,,The logical assumption is that there is something in the grain.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Kirk,,"Yes. Bones, I want the tribbles, the grain, everything analysed. I want to know what killed these tribbles."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Mccoy,,"I haven't figured out what keeps them alive yet. All right, if I find out anything, I'll let you know. (leaves)"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Baris,,"That isn't going to do you any good, Kirk. This project is ruined, and Starfleet is going to hear about it. And when they do, they will have a board of inquiry and they will roast you alive. And I am going to be there, Kirk, to enjoy every minute of it."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,storage compartments,Kirk,,"Until that inquiry, I'm still the captain. And as Captain, I want two things done. First, find Cyrano Jones, and second (as another tribble hits him on the head) close that door."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,,A security guard is picking up tribbles.,
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Jones,,"Really, Captain Kirk, I must protest this treatment."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,"Ah, Mister Jones, with an armful. A few questions."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Koloth,,Captain Kirk!
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,What do you want?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Koloth,,An official apology addressed to the Klingon High Command. I expect you to assume full responsibility for the persecution of Klingon nationals in this quadrant.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,An apology?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Koloth,,"Yes. You've harassed my men. You've treated them like criminals. You've been most uncourteous, Captain Kirk. If you wish to avoid a diplomatic incident"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Baris,,"No, Kirk. You can't let him. That will give them the wedge they need to claim Sherman's Planet."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Spock,,"I believe that more than the word of an aggrieved Klingon commander would be necessary for that, Mister Baris."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Koloth,,"Mister Spock, as far as Sherman's Planet is concerned, Captain Kirk has already given it to us."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,"Well, we'll see about that, but before I take any official action, I'd like to know Just what happened. Who put the tribbles in the quadrotriticale? What was in the grain that killed them?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Koloth,,"Captain Kirk, before you go on, may I make a request?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,Yes.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Koloth,,Can you get those things out of here?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,,"The guards take Jones' tribbles from him. They get to the door as Darvin enters, and the tribbles shriek.",
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Spock,,Remarkable.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,Hold on a minute. I thought you said tribbles liked everybody.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Jones,,They do. I can't understand it. The last time I saw one act this way was at the bar.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,What was in the bar?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Jones,,"Klingons. Him, for one. (points at Korax)"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,,Kirk takes two tribbles from the guards and brings them near Korax. They shriek.,
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,"You're right, Mister Jones. They don't like Klingons. (McCoy enters) But they do like Vulcans. I didn't know you had it in you."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Spock,,"Obviously tribbles are very perceptive creatures, Captain."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,"Obviously. Mister Baris, they like you. Well, there's no accounting for taste. (and back to Darvin) They don't like you, Mister Darvin. I wonder why. Bones?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Mccoy,scanning him,"Heartbeat is all wrong. His body temperature is. Jim, this man is a Klingon."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Baris,,A Klingon?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,"I wonder what Starfleet Command will say about that. What about the grain, Bones?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Mccoy,,"Oh, yes. It was poisoned."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Baris,,Poisoned?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Mccoy,,"Yes. It's been impregnated with a virus. The virus turns into an inert material in the bloodstream. The more the organism eats, the more inert matter is built up. So after two or three days, they reached a point where they couldn't take in enough nourishment to survive."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,"They starved to death. In a storage compartment full of grain, they starved to death."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Mccoy,,That is essentially it.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,"Mister Darvin, are you going to talk?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Darvin,,"I have nothing to say. (Kirk thrusts the tribbles into his face) All right, I poisoned the grain! Take them away."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,And the tribbles had nothing to do with it?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Darvin,,"I don't know. I never saw one before in my life, and I hope I never see one of those fuzzy miserable things again."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Baris,,"I'm certain that can be arranged, Darvin. Guards? If you'll excuse me, Captain."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,,Baris leaves with the security guards and Darvin.,
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,Captain Koloth. About that apology.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Koloth,,Yes?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,You have six hours to get your ship out of Federation territory.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,,"The tribbles shriek, Koloth makes a hasty bow and practically runs out of the room with Korax.",
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,lurry's office,Kirk,,"You know, I think I could learn to like tribbles."

42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Jones,,"Well, Captain, I suppose I'm free to go now."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Kirk,,"No, you're not. There's something I want to show you. You know what the penalty is for transporting an animal proven harmful to human life?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Jones,,"Captain, one little tribble isn't harmful. Captain, you wouldn't do a thing like that to me, now would you? Would you?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Spock,,The penalty is twenty years in a rehabilitation colony.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Jones,,"Captain Kirk. Friend. Friend Kirk. Surely we can come to some sort of mutual understanding. After all, my tribbles did put you wise to the poisoned grain, and they did help you to find the Klingon agent. You saved a lot of lives that way."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Kirk,,There is one thing you can do.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Jones,,Yes?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Kirk,,"Pick up every tribble on the space station. If you do that, I'll speak to Mister Lurry about returning your spaceship."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Jones,,It would take years.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Spock,,"Seventeen point nine, to be exact."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Jones,,Seventeen point nine years.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Kirk,,Consider it Job security.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Jones,,"Captain, you're a hard man. All right! All right!"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Kirk,,You'll do it?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Spock,,He'll do it.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,Jones,,I'll do it.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,k7 bar,,He starts stuffing tribbles into his many pockets.,
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, Starfleet was able to divert that freighter."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Kirk,,Good. That means Sherman's Planet will get its quadrotriticale only a few weeks late. I don't see any tribbles around here.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Mccoy,,And you won't find a tribble on this entire ship.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Kirk,,"Bones, how did you do it?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Mccoy,,I cannot take credit for another man's work. Scotty did it.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Kirk,,Scotty! Where are the tribbles?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Scott,,"Oh, er, Captain, it was really Mister Spock's recommendation."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Kirk,,Of course. Spock.

42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Mccoy,,"Tell him, Spock."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Spock,,"Well, it was Mister Scott who performed the actual engineering."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Kirk,,Mister Scott. Where are the tribbles?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Scott,,"I used the transporter, Captain."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Kirk,,You used the transporter?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Scott,,Aye.
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Kirk,,"Where did you transport them? Scott, you didn't transport them into space, did you?"
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Scott,,"Captain Kirk, that'd be inhuman."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Kirk,,Where are they?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Scott,,"I gave them a good home, sir."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Kirk,shouting,Where?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Scott,,"I gave them to the Klingons, sir."
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Kirk,a whisper,You gave them to the Klingons?
42,2,The Trouble With Tribbles,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, sir. Before they went into warp, I transported the whole kit and caboodle into their engine room, where they'll be no tribble at all."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,,"Everyone on the Bridge is staring at Spock's back, as he analyses some sensor data.",
43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Spock,,"No doubt about it, Captain. The space debris comes from the survey vessel SS Beagle."

43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Spock,,"Portions of the antimatter nacelles, personal belongings. Captain, no signs of bodies whatsoever."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Kirk,,"Then whatever destroyed the ship, the crew was able to get off safely. Navigator, compute the present drift of the wreckage."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Chekov,,"Computed and on the board, sir."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, assuming that the wreckage drifted at the same speed and direction for the past six years?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Spock,,"It would have come from planet four, star system eight nine two, directly ahead."

43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, at the academy. He was dropped in his fifth year. He went into the merchant service."

43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Chekov,,"Definitely class M, somewhat similar to Earth."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, similar. But the land masses and oceans are quite different, however."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Spock,,"Different in shape only, Captain. The proportion of land to water is exactly as on your Earth. Density five point five, diameter seven nine one seven at the equator, atmosphere seventy eight percent nitrogen, twenty one percent oxygen. Again, exactly like Earth."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Kirk,,"Exactly in some ways, different in others."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Spock,,I also picked up indications of large cities.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Kirk,,What era?
43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Spock,,"No sign of atomic power as yet, but far enough along for radio communications, power transportation, an excellent road system."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, both amplitude and frequency modulation being used. I think I can pick up something visual. It's a news broadcast using a system I think they once called video."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Spock,,Television was the colloquial term.

43,2,Bread And Circuses,cave,Kirk,,"Septimus, wherever we may be from, you must believe that it is one of our most important laws that none of us interfere with the affairs of others. If Captain Merik is Merikus, then he has violated that law, and he must be taken away and punished. Will you help us get to the truth of all this?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,cave,Septimus,,First I must discuss it with the others.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,cave,,The men leave.,

43,2,Bread And Circuses,cave,Kirk,,He failed a psycho-simulator test. All it takes is a split second of indecision. Hardly the type to become a political strongman.

43,2,Bread And Circuses,cave,Spock,,"Why, Doctor?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,cave,Mccoy,,"Because, my dear Mister Spock, it is illogical. Rome had no sun worshipers. Why should they parallel Rome in every way except one?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,cave,,The men return.,

43,2,Bread And Circuses,countryside,,"Dressed as slaves in jeans and t-shirts, the landing party are lead towards the city. Spock wears his obligatory woollen hat. They stop by a small thicket of trees.",
43,2,Bread And Circuses,countryside,Flavius,,We'll wait here until dark.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,countryside,Kirk,,"Are you a slave, Flavius?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,countryside,Flavius,,"You are barbarians indeed not to know of Flavius Maximus. For seven years, I was the most successful gladiator in this province."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,countryside,Kirk,,Then you heard the word of the sun?
43,2,Bread And Circuses,countryside,Flavius,,"Yes. The words of peace and freedom. It wasn't easy for me to believe. I was trained to fight. But the words, the words are true."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,countryside,Kirk,,There are many things I'd like to know
43,2,Bread And Circuses,countryside,,he's interrupted by rapid gunfire.,
43,2,Bread And Circuses,countryside,Maximus,,Hold! Don't move! Hands in the air!
43,2,Bread And Circuses,countryside,,Armed police round them up.,
43,2,Bread And Circuses,countryside,Narrator,,Four fleeing fish. A fine haul. Flavius Maximus.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,countryside,,Flavius attacks him and gets knocked down.,
43,2,Bread And Circuses,countryside,Maximus,,"You have been too long absent from the games, Flavius. The first citizen will be pleased. Runaway slaves are always welcome. (removes Spock's hat) No, not slaves. Barbarians. It's been a long time since I've watched barbarians die in the arena."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,countryside,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 4040.9. Uniformed police like those of Earth, a great city like Rome with automobiles. Astonishing similarities to twentieth-century Earth, down to the fine carbon steel in the bars."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,,Spock and McCoy carry Flavius into a cell.,
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Kirk,,Tell Merikus I'd like to see him.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Maximus,,The first citizen? Why would he bother with arena bait like you?
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Kirk,,Tell him it's Jim Kirk. Perhaps a friend.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Maximus,,Perhaps?
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Kirk,,"Well, if I am a friend and you don't tell him, do you really want to risk that?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,,They are locked in and left alone. McCoy tends to Flavius's head wound.,
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Kirk,,"But if there have been slaves for over 2,000 years, hasn't there always been discontent, runaways?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Flavius,,"Long ago there were rebellions, but they were suppressed. And with each century, the slaves acquired more rights under the law. They received rights to medicine, the right to government payments in their old age, and they slowly learned to be content."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Spock,,"Even more fascinating. Slavery evolving into an institution with guaranteed medical payments, old-age pensions."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Mccoy,,"Quite logical, I'd say, Mister Spock. Just as it's logical that twentieth-century Rome would use television to show its gladiator contests or name a new car the Jupiter Eight."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Spock,,"Doctor, if I were able to show emotion, your new infatuation with that term would begin to annoy me."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Mccoy,,"What term? Logic? Medical men are trained in logic, Mister Spock."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Spock,,"Really, Doctor, I had no idea they were trained. Watching you, I assumed it was trial and error."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Flavius,,"Are they enemies, Captain?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Kirk,,"I'm not sure they're sure. When the slaves began to worship the sun, they became discontent again. When did all this happen?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Flavius,,"Long ago. Perhaps as long ago as the beginning of the empire. The message of the sun, that all men are brothers, was kept from us. Perhaps I'm a fool to believe it. It does often seem that man must fight to live."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Kirk,,"You go on believing it, Flavius. All men are brothers."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,,The guards return.,
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Maximus,,Flavius. Your friends are waiting for you. You've already been matched for the morning games. Come.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Flavius,,I will not fight. I'm a Brother of the Sun.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Maximus,,"Put a sword in your hand, and you'll fight. I know you, Flavius, you're as peaceful as a bull."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,,Two guards take Flavius away.,
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Maximus,,You three come with us.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Kirk,,Three against three. We may never get a better chance.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Maximus,,No talking. Outside.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Kirk,looking at McCoy,I doubt if he'll get very far. He feels ill.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Mccoy,,I do?
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Maximus,,Outside!
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Kirk,,"All right, but he'll double over before we get very far. (Spock and Kirk take McCoy's arms.)"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Mccoy,,"No, I think I can walk. I'll try."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,,"McCoy suddenly doubles over in pain and two guards are sent in to help. One gets neck-pinched, the Roman is karate-chopped and the last guard is punched by the invalid.",
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Kirk,,Let's go.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Merik,"blue eyed, red haired) Well done, Jim. (Armed guards appear.",I'm afraid it isn't that easy. They've been handling slaves here for two thousand years.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Claudius,,But it was exciting. They'd do well in the arena.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Kirk,,"Captain Merik, isn't it ?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Merik,,"Yes, it's me. This is our Proconsul, Claudius Marcus."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Claudius,,But this is no place for a reunion.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Merik,,"This way. Your friends, too. There's lots to talk about, lots to explain."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Kirk,,I agree.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,prison,Merik,,"Don't judge me before you know the facts. Come on, we can talk freely here. The Proconsul knows who and what we are."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,,"Some small animal skins on the floor, a brass brazier, an urn and busts on plinths, and a girl preparing drinks.",
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Merik,,You can leave us.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,,The guards leave.,
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Merik,,"Well, a celebration. A meeting of old friends."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,"Prepare food for our friends. They've come from a great distance. A great distance indeed. So, this is a Vulcan. Interesting. From what I've heard, I wish I had fifty of you for the arena."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Merik,,This other is your ship's surgeon?
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,McCoy.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Merik,,"It's a pity we can't let him loose in our hospitals. Our level of medicine would improve immeasurably, I'm sure."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,Come. You must be hungry. Gentlemen?
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,,"They sit at a table, and the girl brings over a plate.",
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,"Oh, try the sparrow broiled in garum. Delicious. Or perhaps some of this roast kid. Lovely thing, isn't she?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,"All right, what happened?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Merik,,"We had meteor damage, Jim. I went ashore with a landing party to look for iridium ore for repairs, and I met this gentleman."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,Go on.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Merik,,He convinced me it would be unfair to this world to carry word of their existence elsewhere.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,"Contamination. Can't risk that. Oh, you'll understand as you learn more about us."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Merik,,So I made the decision to stay.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,"What happened to your crew? Did they voluntarily beam, come ashore?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Merik,,"This is an ordered world, Jim, a conservative world based on time-honoured Roman strengths and virtues."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,What happened to your crew?
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Merik,,"There's been no war here for over four hundred years, Jim. Could, let's say, your land of that same era make that same boast? I think you can see why they don't want to have their stability contaminated by dangerous ideas of other ways and other places."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Spock,,"Interesting, and given a conservative empire, quite understandable."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Mccoy,,Are you out of your head?
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Spock,,"I said I understood it, Doctor. I find the checks and balances of this civilisation quite illuminating."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Mccoy,,Next he'll be telling us he prefers it over Earth history.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Spock,,"They do seem to have escaped the carnage of your first three world wars, Doctor."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Mccoy,,"They have slavery, gladiatorial games, despotism."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Spock,,"Situations quite familiar to the six million who died in your first world war, the eleven million who died in your second, the thirty seven million who died in your third. Shall I go on?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,"Interesting. And you, Captain, which world do you prefer?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,"My world, proconsul, is my vessel, my oath, my crew. What happened to your vessel you've explained. What happened to your oath is obvious."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Merik,,"And as for my men, those that were able to adapt to this world are still alive. Those who couldn't adapt are dead. That's the way it is with life everywhere, isn't it?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,You sent your own men into the arena?
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Merik,,"Just as I did, Jim, you're going to order your own people ashore."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Mccoy,,You must know that's impossible. Starfleet regulations
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,"Are designed to circumvent any such order. There may be over four hundred men on your ship, Captain, but they can be brought down if it's handled properly. Say, a few at a time. You see, I have the advantage of a trained ship captain to tell me what is and what is not possible. Your communicator, Captain Kirk. Now do save us all a lot of unnecessary trouble and issue the appropriate orders."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Merik,,"They're going to be arriving soon, anyway, Jim. A recon party, then a rescue party, then another rescue party. I had less men. It added up the same."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,Do you really believe I could be made to order my own people down?
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,"I believe this, Captain. That you would do almost anything rather than see these two dear friends put slowly to death."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,,Kirk takes the communicator.,
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Mccoy,,Jim.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Scott,,Bridge. Scott here.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,,Armed guards enter.,
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,"Scotty, if you have a fix. (guns are pointed at his head) Stand by, Scotty."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,"Very wise of you, Captain. No point in sending up bullet-ridden corpses."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,"Yet on the other hand, my chief engineer's standing by for a message."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,"I do hope so, for your sake. Now, Captain, what are you going to order your men to do?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,If I brought down a hundred of them armed with phasers
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,"you could probably defeat the combined armies of our entire empire, and violate your oath regarding noninterference with other societies. I believe you all swear you'll die before you'd violate that directive. Am I right?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Spock,,Quite correct.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Mccoy,,Must you always be so blasted honest?
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,"But on the other hand, why even bother to send your men down? From what I understand, your vessel could lay waste to the entire surface of the world. Oh, but there's that Prime Directive in the way again. Can't interfere."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Merik,,"Jim, you've already started a message. Your engineer's waiting. What are you going to do?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,Scotty. Sorry to keep you waiting.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Scott,,"We were becoming concerned, Captain. You were a bit overdue."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,Order your officers to come down.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,"Condition Green, all's well. Kirk out."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,"Guards, take them. Prepare them for the games."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Merik,,"Ah, that was stupid, Jim. This is not an Academy training test. This is for real. They're taking you to die."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Narrator,,"Ship's log, stardate 4041.2. Chief Engineer Scott recording. Captain Kirk and his landing party have checked in"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Scott,,"But they have used the code term Condition Green, which means they're in trouble. But it also prohibits my taking any action. (ends log entry) Mister Chekov, pinpoint power source locations. Type, power, load factors, and how much our beams will have to pull to overload them."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Chekov,,That may take some time.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,bridge,Scott,,"Let it take time, lad. They're in trouble, and I'm under orders not to interfere. However, no order can stop me from frightening them. It may do no good, but it may suggest to someone just what a starship can really do. Aye."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,,"Actually, a painted backdrop in the Empire TV television studio. The commentator sits on scaffolding next to a camera operator.",
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Announcer,,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Live and direct from City Arena, and in colour, we bring you Name the Winner, brought to you tonight by your Jupiter Eight dealers from coast to coast. In just a moment, tonight's first heat. We're in a taped commercial, Proconsul. Forty seconds, then we'll be back live."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,,"Claudius, Merik and Kirk take seats on a raised platform. Kirk is manacled, and there are two armed guards behind him. Spock and McCoy are brought out by two guards in full traditional dress.",
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Announcer,,"Stand by. Ten seconds. And first tonight, ladies and gentlemen, a surprise extra. In the far corner, a pair of highly aggressive barbarians. Strong, intelligent, with strange ways, and I'm sure full of a lot of surprises. And facing them, two favorites here from previous encounters, Achilles and Flavius. (The canned applause is turned up by a bored sound effects man) Victory or death? And for which of them? Well, ladies and gentlemen, you know as much about that at this moment as I do because this is your programme. You name the winner."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Flavius,,"I don't mind fighting, but why you?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Voice,,Begin!
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,,"Achilles takes on Spock. They are well matched. McCoy is against Flavius, and doesn't know what to do with a short sword.",
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Announcer,,"Flavius may be getting off to a slow start, but he's never disappointed this crowd. A close one. The barbarian with the pointed ears seems to be in trouble."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Spock,,I tell you I'm well able to defeat you.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Achilles,,"Fight, barbarian!"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Merik,,Most of my men went the same way. I hoped I would feel it less with yours.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Spock,,I do not want to injure you.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,,The cat-calls and hisses are amplified. Flavius gets a taste of the whip.,
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Master,,"Fight, you two. You bring this network's ratings down, Flavius, and we'll do a special on you."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,,McCoy puts more effort into it.,
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Claudius,,"Question, Captain?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Kirk,,"The rules. If Spock should finish his man off first, would he be able to help"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Claudius,,"We believe men should fight their own battles. Only the weak will die. My word as a Roman. Ready to order your men down, Captain?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Merik,,"Maybe now you understand why I gave in. The Romans have always been the strongest, and they've had practice for over two thousand years in enslaving men, using them, killing them."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Claudius,,"Quite true, Captain Kirk. The games have always strengthened us. Death becomes a familiar pattern. We don't fear it as you do."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,,Flavius gets whipped again,
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Flavius,,At least defend yourself.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Mccoy,,I am defending myself!
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Flavius,,"Not like that, you fool. Hold your weapon higher."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,,The cat-calls are replaced by cheers,
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Claudius,,"Admit it. You find these games frightening, revolting."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Kirk,,"Proconsul, in some parts of the galaxy I have seen forms of entertainment that makes this look like a folk dance."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Claudius,,"Certain this isn't different, Captain? Those are your men dying, not strangers."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Kirk,,I've had to select men to die before so that others could be saved.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Claudius,,"You're a clever liar, Captain Kirk. Merikus was a spaceship captain. I've observed him thoroughly. Your species has no such strength."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Merik,,"He commands not just a spaceship, Proconsul, but a starship. A very special vessel and crew. I tried for such a command."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Claudius,,"I see no evidence of superiority. They fight no better than your men did, Merikus. Perhaps not as well."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Achilles,,Stop running. Fight.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Spock,,"Need any help, Doctor?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Mccoy,,Whatever gave you that idea?
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Achilles,,"Fight, you pointed-ear freak!"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Mccoy,,"You tell him, buster. Of all the completely ridiculous, illogical questions I ever heard in my life!"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,,"McCoy falls, and is vulnerable. Achilles is distracted so Spock punches him out then goes and neck-pinches Flavius.",
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Master,,"A clear foul, Proconsul. Your decision?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Claudius,,"Your opinion, Merikus? After all, they're like yourself."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Merik,,"It's your decision, Proconsul."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,arena,Claudius,,"Your opinion, Captain Kirk? Would you like me to kill them now? An easy death? Then you'd gladly accept whatever happens to you. Take them back to their cage. Well, it won't go that easily for them, Captain, nor for you. Take him to my quarters."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,,"Kirk is alone in the room, and is startled when a curtain is pulled back and the blonde girl appears, wearing very little.",
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Drusilla,,"I was told to wait for you and provide wine, food, whatever you wish. I am Proconsul's slave Drusilla. Although for this evening. (pause) For this evening I was told I am your slave. Command me."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,It won't work.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Drusilla,,What will not work?
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,"Whatever he has in mind, whatever tricks. You hear that, Proconsul? It won't work. I'm not co-operating. I may die, but you won't get any entertainment out of it."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Drusilla,,We're alone. Please believe me. I've never lied to one who owns me.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,jail,,Spock is checking the iron bars of their prison.,
43,2,Bread And Circuses,jail,Mccoy,,"Angry, Mister Spock, or frustrated, perhaps?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,jail,Spock,,"Such emotions are foreign to me, Doctor. I'm merely testing the strength of the door."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,jail,Mccoy,,"For the fifteenth time. Spock. Spock, I know we've had our disagreements. Maybe they're jokes. I don't know. As Jim says, we're not often sure ourselves sometimes, but what I'm trying to say is"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,jail,Spock,,"Doctor, I am seeking a means of escape. Will you please be brief?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,jail,Mccoy,,"Well, what I'm trying to say is you saved my life in the arena."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,jail,Spock,,"Yes, that's quite true."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,jail,Mccoy,,"I'm trying to thank you, you pointed-eared hobgoblin!"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,jail,Spock,,"Oh, yes. You humans have that emotional need to express gratitude. You're welcome, I believe, is the correct response. However, Doctor, you must remember I am entirely motivated by logic. The loss of our ship's surgeon, whatever I think of his skill, would mean a reduction in the efficiency of the Enterprise and therefore"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,jail,Mccoy,,"Do you know why you're not afraid to die, Spock? You're more afraid of living. Each day you stay alive is just one more day you might slip and let your human half peek out. That's it, isn't it? Insecurity. Why, you wouldn't know what to do with a genuine, warm, decent feeling."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,jail,Spock,,"Really, Doctor?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,jail,Mccoy,,"I know. I'm worried about Jim, too."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,,The wine is being poured.,
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,Very good. (he tries a grape) Excellent.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Drusilla,,I was concerned. I am ordered to please you.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,I've been in some strange worlds with strange customs. Perhaps this is considered torture here.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Drusilla,,"Torture? I do not understand. I do not wish to see you tortured in any way. (she kisses him) At the first sign of pain, you will tell me?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,You'll be the first to know.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,,"Later, when the oil lamp has burnt out, and Kirk is asleep",
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,"Captain. (Kirk wakes with a start) I'm sorry I was detained. Should we have our little talk now? So far on this planet we've kept you rather busy. I don't wonder you slept through the afternoon. By the way, one of the communicators we took from you is missing. Was it my pretty Drusilla by any chance?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,,Merik enters. There are guards in the room now too.,
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,"See if he has it. Not that I would have punished her. I would have blamed you. You're a Roman, Kirk, or you should have been. It's not on his person?"
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Merik,,"No, Proconsul."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,I am sorry I was detained. I trust there was nothing further you required?
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,Nothing except perhaps an explanation.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,"Because you're a man, I owe you that. You must die shortly, and because you are a man (pauses) Would you leave us, Merik? The thoughts of one man to another cannot possibly interest you."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,,Merik leaves.,
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,"Because you are a man, I gave you some last hours as a man."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,I appreciate that.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,"Unfortunately, we must demonstrate that defiance is intolerable."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,Of course.
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,"But I've learned to respect you. I promise you, you will die easily, quickly."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,I thank you. And my friends?
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Claudius,,"When their time comes, the same of course. Guards. Take him to the arena. Oh, we've pre-empted fifteen minutes on the early show for you. In full colour. We guarantee you a splendid audience. You may not understand because you're centuries beyond anything as crude as television."
43,2,Bread And Circuses,chamber,Kirk,,I've heard it was similar.

43,2,Bread And Circuses,jail,Spock,,I wish we could have examined that belief of his more closely. It seems illogical for a sun worshiper to develop a philosophy of total brotherhood. Sun worship is usually a primitive superstition religion.

44,2,Journey to Babel,lounge,Sarek,,"Under Federation law, Coridan can be protected and its wealth administered for the benefit of its people."

44,2,Journey to Babel,corridor,Kirk,,Explain.
44,2,Journey to Babel,corridor,Mccoy,,"Well, from the nature and location of the break, I'd say the killer knew exactly where to apply pressure to snap the neck instantly."
44,2,Journey to Babel,corridor,Kirk,,Who aboard would have that knowledge?
44,2,Journey to Babel,corridor,Spock,,"Vulcans. On Vulcan, the method is called tal-shaya. It was considered a merciful form of execution in ancient times."
44,2,Journey to Babel,corridor,Kirk,,"Spock. A short time ago, I broke up an argument between Gav and your father."
44,2,Journey to Babel,corridor,Spock,,"Indeed, Captain? Interesting."
44,2,Journey to Babel,corridor,Mccoy,,"Interesting? Spock, do you realise that makes your father the most likely suspect?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,corridor,Spock,,Vulcans do not approve of violence.
44,2,Journey to Babel,corridor,Kirk,,You're saying he couldn't have done it?
44,2,Journey to Babel,corridor,Spock,,"No, Captain. I'm merely saying it would be illogical to kill without reason."
44,2,Journey to Babel,corridor,Kirk,,"But if he had a reason, could he have done it?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,corridor,Spock,,"If there were a reason, my father is quite capable of killing. Logically and efficiently."

44,2,Journey to Babel,sarek's quarters,Amanda,,He's been gone for some time. It's his habit to meditate in private before retiring. What's wrong? Spock?

44,2,Journey to Babel,sarek's quarters,Mccoy,,"His neck was broken, Mister Ambassador, by what Spock describes as tal-shaya."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sarek's quarters,Sarek,,Indeed? Interesting.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sarek's quarters,Kirk,,"Yes. Ambassador, where were you during the past hour?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,sarek's quarters,Amanda,,"Captain, you're not accusing him?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,sarek's quarters,Spock,,"Mother. If only on circumstantial evidence, he is a logical suspect."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sarek's quarters,Sarek,,I quite agree.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sarek's quarters,Kirk,,Then where were you during the hour?
44,2,Journey to Babel,sarek's quarters,Sarek,,"In private meditation, Captain. Spock will tell you that such meditation is a personal experience, not to be discussed. especially not with Earthmen."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sarek's quarters,Kirk,,"That's a very convenient excuse, Ambassador."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sarek's quarters,,Sarek suddenly collapses.,
44,2,Journey to Babel,sarek's quarters,Amanda,,Sarek. Sarek. What's wrong?
44,2,Journey to Babel,sarek's quarters,Mccoy,,"It's difficult to say with Vulcan physiology, but I believe it's something to do with his cardiovascular system."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sarek's quarters,Kirk,,Can you help him?

44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Kirk,,Spock?
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Spock,,"Yes, Captain. I get sensor readings of tri-tritanium from the alien ship's hull."
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Kirk,,I'm sorry about your father.
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Spock,,"Yes, it could adversely affect our mission."
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Kirk,,Aren't you worried about him?
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Spock,,"Worry is a human emotion, Captain. I accept what has happened. The ship's hull seems to have a high density level or is cloaked against sensor probes. It is manned, but sensors cannot make out specifics."
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Kirk,,"I see. Well, the Romulans have nothing like it. Certainly not the Federation or the neutral planets. What about the Klingons?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Spock,,I think it unlikely it is one of theirs.
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Kirk,,"Who, then?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Uhura,,Captain? I picked up the last part of a transmission. Just like that other one. I put the recorder and the directional locator on it immediately.

44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Chekov,,"It's the intruder ship, sir."
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Kirk,,"Switch recorder to Mister Spock's station for decode, Lieutenant."
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Uhura,,"Sir, the directional locator indicates reception point somewhere within the body of this ship."
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Kirk,,A personal receiver? Somebody on board is in contact with that vessel?
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Spock,,"Possibly, Captain. But I cannot decode this transmission."
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Kirk,,Why not?
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Spock,,It is in no known code. There's no detectable pattern. No standard references apply.
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Kirk,,Are any conclusions possible from the information?
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Spock,,"Only negative. It fits none of our computer records, and it is alien."
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Kirk,,"Murder? Someone out there playing tag? Lieutenant, you've got your sensor locator on a wide beam. You've established a receiver on board this vessel. Tighten your field to the interior of the ship."
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir."
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Kirk,,"If that alien vessel starts transmitting again, I want to know who on board the Enterprise is receiving."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Kirk,,"Bones, how is he?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,"As far as I can tell from instrument readings, our prime suspect has a malfunction in one of the heart valve. It's similar to a heart attack in a human. But with Vulcan physiology, it's impossible to tell without an operation. Mrs. Sarek, has he had any previous attacks?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Amanda,,No.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Sarek,,Yes. There were three others. My physician prescribed Benjisidrine for the condition.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Amanda,,Why didn't you tell me?
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Sarek,,There was nothing you could have done.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Kirk,,"Ambassador, when did you have these attacks?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Sarek,,"Two before we left Vulcan, the third a few hours ago. I was on the observation deck. When the Tellarite was murdered, I was quite incapacitated."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Kirk,,There were no witnesses?
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Sarek,,None.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Spock,,"Doctor, do you propose surgery for the heart defect?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I'm not sure. It's tough enough on a human. On a Vulcan, an ordinary operation's out of the question."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Kirk,,Why?
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Sarek,,Because of the construction of the Vulcan heart.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Spock,,I suggest that a cryogenic open-heart procedure would be the logical approach.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Sarek,,"Yes, unquestionably."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Kirk,,"Bones, what about it?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well, I'm glad somebody's asking me something around here. Well, the procedure they're discussing would require tremendous amounts of blood for the patient."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Chapel,,Doctor?
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,Yes.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Chapel,,I've checked the blood bank. There isn't enough Vulcan blood and plasma to even begin such an operation of this type.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Kirk,,There are other Vulcans aboard.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Sarek,,"My blood type is T-negative. Somewhat rare, even for a Vulcan."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Yes, I'd say that's rare."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Spock,,"My blood is T-negative, Doctor."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Chapel,,We've run a number of blood tests on Mister Spock. It isn't true Vulcan blood either. It has human blood elements in it.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Spock,,It should be possible to filter out the human factors.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Even you couldn't give that much blood, Spock. It would kill you."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Kirk,,Bones.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Mrs. Sarek, you must understand the chances are extremely small to find a way to produce sufficient T-negative blood."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Spock,,Indeed. I would estimate the odds
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Amanda,,Please don't.
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Spock,,Doctor.
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"I see it, Spock, but that was a Rigelian."
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Spock,,Rigelian physiology is very similar to Vulcan.
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,Similar is not good enough. It's still experimental.
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Spock,,But it does look promising.
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"Spock, we would need such great amounts of blood that, even if the drug worked on the Vulcans as well as a Rigelian, which I'm doubtful, it would still drain Sarek to a critical level."
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Spock,,"I consider the safety factor low, but acceptable."
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"Plus the fact I've never operated on a Vulcan before. Oh, I've studied the anatomical types. I know where all the organs are. But that's a lot different from actual surgical experience. So if I don't kill him with the operation, the drug probably will."
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Amanda,,"What drug, Doctor? My husband is asleep. What drug?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,A chemical stimulant to speed up reproduction and replacement of blood in the body. It's only experimental.
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Spock,,It has been used successfully on test subjects on Rigel Five.
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"It places a tremendous strain on the spleen and the liver. In Sarek's condition, the stimulant would kill him."
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Spock,,"Miss Chapel? I underwent a physical examination last week. Would you pull those records, please?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Chapel,,"Already pulled. You're perfectly healthy, Mister Spock."
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,What has that got
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Amanda,,You're going to use it on yourself. A transfusion from you to your father.
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Spock,,It would seem the only answer.
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"It could damage you internally. It could kill you. I'm sorry, Spock. I can't sanction it."
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Amanda,,And I refuse to permit it. I won't risk both of you.
44,2,Journey to Babel,mccoy's office,Spock,,"Then you automatically condemn Sarek to death. And you, Doctor, have no logical alternative either. If you do not operate, Sarek will die. You now have the means to perform the operation. I am volunteering myself as the blood donor. I'll be at my station until you require me."
44,2,Journey to Babel,corridor,,Kirk is in the middle of a vigorous fight with an Andorian (the blue people with antennae). The Andorian pulls a knife and stabs Kirk before getting kicked unconscious.,

44,2,Journey to Babel,corridor,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 3843.4. First Officer Spock in temporary command. The captain has been critically wounded by one of the delegates to the Babel conference. The ship is on alert status. We are still being followed by the intruder vessel."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,"It's a bad wound. Punctured left lung. A centimetre or so lower, it'd have gone through the heart."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Spock,,I'll be in the brig questioning the Andorian prisoner.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Chapel,monitoring Sarek,"Doctor, the K2 factor is dropping."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Spock, your father is much worse. There's no longer a choice. I have to operate immediately. We can begin as soon as you're prepared."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Spock,,"No, Doctor."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,What?
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Spock,,"My first responsibility is to the ship. Our passengers' safety is by Starfleet order of first importance. We are being followed by an alien, possibly hostile, vessel. I cannot relinquish command under these circumstances."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,You can turn command over to Scotty.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Spock,,"On what grounds, Doctor? Command requirements do not recognise personal privilege. I'll be in the brig interrogating the Andorian."
44,2,Journey to Babel,brig,Shras,,"He is Thelev, a minor member of my staff. I know nothing of him except that he has served adequately."
44,2,Journey to Babel,brig,Spock,,He has been subjected to questioning under verifier scan and truth drug. He reveals nothing. I suggest his mind has been so conditioned as part of a preconceived plan.
44,2,Journey to Babel,brig,Shras,,"My people are a violent race, but we've no quarrel with Captain Kirk."
44,2,Journey to Babel,brig,Spock,,Apparently Thelev did.
44,2,Journey to Babel,brig,Shras,,You suggest a plot. How could it profit us to harm the captain?
44,2,Journey to Babel,brig,Spock,,I do not know. There is no logic in Thelev's attack upon the captain. There is no logic in Gav's murder.
44,2,Journey to Babel,brig,Shras,,Perhaps you should forget logic and devote yourself to motivations of passion or gain. Those are reasons for murder.
44,2,Journey to Babel,spock's quarters,,The doorbell rings impatiently.,
44,2,Journey to Babel,spock's quarters,Spock,,Come in.
44,2,Journey to Babel,spock's quarters,Amanda,,"Spock, you must turn command over to somebody else."
44,2,Journey to Babel,spock's quarters,Spock,,"Mother, when I was commissioned, I took an oath to carry out responsibilities which were clearly and exactly specified."
44,2,Journey to Babel,spock's quarters,Amanda,,Any competent officer can command this ship. Only you can give your father the blood transfusions that he needs to live.
44,2,Journey to Babel,spock's quarters,Spock,,Any competent officer can command this ship under normal circumstances. The circumstances are not normal. We're carrying over one hundred valuable Federation passengers. We're being pursued by an alien ship. We're subject to possible attack. There has been murder and attempted murder on board. I cannot dismiss my duties.
44,2,Journey to Babel,spock's quarters,Amanda,,Duty? Your duty is to your father.
44,2,Journey to Babel,spock's quarters,Spock,,"I know, but this must take precedence. If I could give the transfusion without loss of time or efficiency, I would. Sarek understands my reason."
44,2,Journey to Babel,spock's quarters,Amanda,,"Well, I don't. It's not human. That's not a dirty word. You're human, too. Let that part of you come through. Your father's dying."
44,2,Journey to Babel,spock's quarters,Spock,,"Mother, how can you have lived on Vulcan so long, married a Vulcan, raised a son on Vulcan, without understanding what it means to be a Vulcan?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,spock's quarters,Amanda,,"If this is what it means, I don't want to know."
44,2,Journey to Babel,spock's quarters,Spock,,"It means to adopt a philosophy, a way of life, which is logical and beneficial. We cannot disregard that philosophy merely for personal gain, no matter how important that gain might be."
44,2,Journey to Babel,spock's quarters,Amanda,,Nothing is as important as your father's life.
44,2,Journey to Babel,spock's quarters,Spock,,"Can you imagine what my father would say if I were to agree, if I were to give up command of this vessel, jeopardise hundreds of lives, risk interplanetary war, all for the life of one person?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,spock's quarters,Amanda,,"When you were five years old and came home stiff-lipped, anguished, because the other boys tormented you saying that you weren't really Vulcan. I watched you, knowing that inside that the human part of you was crying and I cried, too. There must be some part of me in you, some part that I still can reach. If being Vulcan is more important to you, then you'll stand there speaking rules and regulations from Starfleet and Vulcan philosophy, and let your father die. And I'll hate you for the rest of my life."
44,2,Journey to Babel,spock's quarters,Spock,,Mother
44,2,Journey to Babel,spock's quarters,Amanda,,"Oh, go to him. Now. Please."

44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,,Tries to sit up and fails.,
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,Now let that be a lesson to you. Just lie there and be happy you're still alive.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Kirk,,How's Sarek?
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,Not good. If I could only operate.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Kirk,,What's stopping you? I thought you were all ready.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I was. When you became injured, Spock assumed command. He's going to stay there until you're back on your feet, even if it costs Sarek his life. Regulations."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Kirk,,"I can't damn him for his loyalty, for doing his duty, but I'm not going to let him commit patricide."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Jim, if you stand, you could start to bleed again."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Kirk,,"Bones, Sarek will die without that operation, and you can't operate without transfusions from Spock. I'll convince Spock I'm all right and order him to report here. As soon as he leaves the bridge, I'll turn command over to Scotty and report to my quarters. Will that fill your prescription?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Spock,,Captain?
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Kirk,,"I'll take over, Mister Spock. You report to Sickbay with Doctor McCoy."
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, are you quite all right?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Mccoy,,"I've certified him physically fit, Mister Spock. Now since I have an operation to perform and both of us are required"
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Kirk,,"Get out, Spock. Chekov, what's the status of the intruder?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Chekov,,"No change, sir. Maintaining its distance."
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Kirk,,"Any further transmissions, Lieutenant?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Uhura,,"None, sir."
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,,The turbolift doors close on Spock and McCoy.,

44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Chekov,,"Captain, the alien vessel is moving closer."
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Kirk,,Belay that order. I'll stay here.
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, I'm picking up the alien signal again, but it's coming from inside the Enterprise."
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Kirk,,Specific origin?
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Uhura,,"From the brig, sir."
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Kirk,,Security? Security to the brig. Search the prisoner immediately.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Readings, Nurse."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Chapel,,"Mister Spock's blood reproduction rate is up over two hundred percent. Sarek's heartbeat has risen to three hundred and twenty four. Blood pressure ninety over forty, dropping."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,I wish I knew whether that was good or bad. Initiate sterile field.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Chapel,,Mister Spock.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,,Spock is starting to get up.,

44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,,A very big flare makes everyone shield their eyes.,

44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Thelev,,"Only temporarily, Captain. You see, I had orders to self-destruct, too. Slow poison. Quite painless, actually, but there's no known antidote. I anticipate another ten minutes of life."
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Kirk,,Take him to Sickbay.
44,2,Journey to Babel,bridge,Thelev,,I seem to have miscalculated.

44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Kirk,,"We damaged their ship. They destroyed themselves to avoid capture. Bones, Thelev's body will be brought to your lab. I want an autopsy performed as soon as possible."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Spock,,"I think you'll find he's an Orion, Doctor."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,Orion?
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Spock,,Intelligence reports that Orion smugglers have been raiding the Coridan system.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Kirk,,But what would they gain by an attack on Starfleet?
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Sarek,,Mutual suspicion and interplanetary war.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Kirk,,"Yes, of course. With Orion carefully neutral, they'd clean up supplying dilithium to both sides and continue to raid Coridan."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Spock,,"The thing that confused me was the power utilisation curve. It made them seem more powerful than a starship or anything known to us. That ship was constructed for a suicide mission. Since they never intended to return to their home base, they could use one hundred percent power on their attacks. The thing I don't understand is why I didn't think of it earlier."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Kirk,,You might have had something else on your mind.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Spock,,That hardly seems likely.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Kirk,,"No, but thank you anyway."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Amanda,,"And you, Sarek. Would you also say thank you to your son?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Sarek,,I don't understand.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Amanda,,For saving your life.
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Sarek,,"Spock acted in the only logical manner open to him. One does not thank logic, Amanda."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Amanda,,"Logic, logic! I'm sick to death of logic. Do you want to know how I feel about your logic?"
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Spock,,"Emotional, isn't she?"

44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Spock,,Indeed? Why did you marry her?
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Sarek,,"At the time, it seemed the logical thing to do."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Kirk,,"Bones. (starts to collapse.) No, no, I'm all right"
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,,McCoy helps him onto a bed.,
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,"If you keep arguing with your kindly family doctor, you're going to spend your next ten days right here. If you co-operate, you'll be out in two."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Spock,,"Doctor, I'll return to my station now."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,"You are at your station, Mister Spock."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Kirk,,"Doctor McCoy, I believe you're enjoying all this."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Spock,,"Indeed, Captain. I've never seen him look so happy."
44,2,Journey to Babel,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Shut up. (to Kirk) Shh. Shh! (to camera) Well, what do you know? I finally got the last word."
45,2,A Private Little War,planet surface,,Doctor McCoy is sampling the local vegetation when his communicator beeps.,
45,2,A Private Little War,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Yes, Jim."
45,2,A Private Little War,planet surface,Kirk,,"How much longer, McCoy?"
45,2,A Private Little War,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Oh, about another thirty minutes. I've come across some most interesting organic compounds. Hey, Starfleet was right."
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,,Kirk is also on the planet.,
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,Mccoy,,These roots and soil cultures can be a medical treasure house. Any problems there?
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,No sign of the inhabitants so far. Kirk out.
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,Spock,,Large prints. The ape-like carnivore in the reports?
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,"Yes, the mugato. No problem, though. Those prints are several days old. They seldom stay in one place."
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,Spock,,"Aside from that, you say it's a Garden of Eden?"
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,Or so it seemed to the brash young Lieutenant Kirk on his first planet survey.
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,Spock,,Class M in all respects. Quite Earth-like.
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,"Except these people stayed in their Garden of Eden. Bows and arrows for hunting, but absolutely no fighting among themselves. Remarkably peaceful and tranquil."
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,Voice,,Ho! Take cover here!
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,,"Kirk and Spock dash off to investigate, and see three dark-haired locals laying an ambush, armed with long-barreled guns.",
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,Spock,,"Bows and arrows, Captain?"
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,Villagers with flintlocks? That's impossible. They hadn't progressed nearly that far.
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,Spock,,"Captain, look."
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,,A group of blond hunters is approaching. They do have bows and arrows.,
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,Kirk,,One of those men walking into ambush is Tyree. The friend I lived with here. (He draws his phaser.)
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,Spock,,"Captain, use of our phasers is expressly forbidden."
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,,So instead Kirk throws a rock which startles a villager into firing his weapon early.,
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,Tyree,,Villagers!
45,2,A Private Little War,rocky outcrop,,"There's a chase, hunters after the villagers, and the villagers pursuing Kirk and Spock. A shot is fired, which McCoy hears.",

45,2,A Private Little War,planet surface,,"Kirk and Spock come running, then Spock gets shot in the back.",
45,2,A Private Little War,planet surface,Kirk,,"Spock? Your phaser. (it is missing, so Kirk prepares to use his to defend his friend.)"
45,2,A Private Little War,planet surface,Spock,,"No, Captain. I can travel."
45,2,A Private Little War,planet surface,,They join McCoy.,
45,2,A Private Little War,planet surface,Kirk,,"Beam us up, quickly."
45,2,A Private Little War,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Now, Scotty. Have medics stand by."
45,2,A Private Little War,planet surface,,They beam out just before the villagers arrive.,
45,2,A Private Little War,transporter room,Scott,,"What happened, Captain?"

45,2,A Private Little War,transporter room,Kirk,,Kirk here.
45,2,A Private Little War,transporter room,Uhura,,"Uhura, sir. We have a Klingon vessel on our screen."
45,2,A Private Little War,transporter room,Kirk,,On my way. Scotty. Bones?
45,2,A Private Little War,transporter room,Mccoy,,"I don't know yet, Jim."
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Chekov,,"Captain, we're holding the planet between us and the Klingons. I don't think they've spotted us."
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Uhura,,"Make that definite, sir. They're sending a routine message to their home base with no mention of us."
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Kirk,,Good. Go to Yellow Alert.
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Uhura,,Yellow Alert. All stations go to Yellow Alert.
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Kirk,,"Do you think you can keep us out of their sight, Chekov?"
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Chekov,,"I can try, Captain."
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Uhura,,"Message to Starbase, sir?"
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Kirk,,"No point in giving ourselves away, Lieutenant. Not until we find out what's going on."
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Scott,,"We can hide for a while, sir, but we may have to go out of orbit to keep it up for long."
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Kirk,,Kirk to Sickbay.
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Mccoy,,McCoy here. I'll call you soon as I know anything. Sickbay out.
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Kirk,,"So, they've broken the treaty."
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Scott,,"Not necessarily, Captain. They have as much right to scientific missions here as we have."
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Kirk,,Research is not the Klingon way.
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Scott,,"True, but since this is a hands-off planet, how are you going to prove they're doing otherwise?"
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Kirk,,"When I left there thirteen years ago, those villagers had barely learned to forge iron. Spock was shot with a flintlock. How many centuries between those two developments?"
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Uhura,,"On Earth, about twelve, sir."
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Scott,,"On the other hand, a flintlock would be the first firearm the inhabitants would normally develop."
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, I'm aware of that, Mister Scott."
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Chekov,,"And, sir, the fact Earth took twelve centuries doesn't mean they had to."
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Uhura,,We've seen different development at rates on different planets.
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Scott,,"And were the Klingons behind it, why didn't they give them breechloaders?"
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Chekov,,Or machine guns?
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Uhura,,Or old-style hand lasers?
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Kirk,,"I did not invite a debate. I'm sorry. I'm worried about Spock and concerned about what's happened to something I once knew down there. You have the conn, Scotty. I'll be in Sickbay."
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,M'Benga,,"We've no replacements for the damaged organs, sir. If he's going to live, his Vulcan physiology will have to do it for him."
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Mccoy,,Agreed. Sterilite off.
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Chapel,,"Yes, sir."
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Mccoy,,"He'll live or die now, Jim. I don't know which. Doctor M'Benga interned on a Vulcan ward. He couldn't be in better hands."
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Kirk,,Then you and I are transporting down.
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Mccoy,,I can't leave Spock at this time.
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Kirk,,"You just indicated you could. There are Klingons here. If their mission is a legitimate research interest in the planet's organic potential, then you're the one man who can tell me."
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Mccoy,,And if that's not it?
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Kirk,,Then I need help. Advice I can trust as much as Spock's.
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I appreciate the compliment, Jim, but"
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Kirk,,"Bones, I'm as worried about Spock as you are, but if the Klingons are breaking the treaty it could be interstellar war. Kirk to Bridge."
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Scott,,"Bridge, Scott here."
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Kirk,,McCoy and I are transporting back down. Inform ship's stores that we'll need native costumes.
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Scott,,"Captain, we may have to break out of orbit any minute to keep out of their sight. We'd be out of communicator range with you."
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Kirk,,I understand. We'll arrange a rendezvous schedule. Kirk out.
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 4211.4. Keeping our presence here secret is an enormous tactical advantage, therefore I cannot risk contact with Starfleet Command. I must take action on my own judgment.

45,2,A Private Little War,planet surface,,McCoy and Kirk are dressed in the leathers of hill people.,

45,2,A Private Little War,planet surface,Mccoy,,"I read it. Inhabitants superior in many ways to humans. Left alone, they undoubtedly someday will develop a remarkably advanced and peaceful culture."
45,2,A Private Little War,planet surface,Kirk,,Indeed. And I intend to see that they have that chance. You coming with me?
45,2,A Private Little War,planet surface,Mccoy,,Do I have a choice?
45,2,A Private Little War,planet surface,,"So they make their way down the slope, and Kirk gets pounced on by a big white ape with a large horn on it's head and spines down it's back.

45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Kirk,,Can you take us to their village while it's still dark?

45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Mccoy,,Many ways? What else does she know about us?
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Nona,,Tyree has told me much of you. Do not blame him. It was the price for saving your life.

45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Kirk,,I am grateful.
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Mccoy,,A splendid custom if not carried to extremes.
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Kirk,,"We once were as you are, Spears, arrows. There came a time when our weapons grew faster than our wisdom, and we almost destroyed ourselves.

45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Nona,,Some men never grow.
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Kirk,,Perhaps not as fast or in the way another thinks he should. But we're wise enough to know that we are wise enough not to interfere with the way of a man or another world.

45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Tyree,,No! I said I will not kill!

45,2,A Private Little War,building,Krell,,"You are late, my friend Apella."
45,2,A Private Little War,building,Apella,,A quarrel by my people. A division of some skins and a hill woman taken this morning. It's hard to divide one woman.
45,2,A Private Little War,building,Krell,,Give her to the man who killed the most of her people. The others will see the profit in bravery. I'll make a Klingon of you yet.
45,2,A Private Little War,building,,He hands over another flintlock.,
45,2,A Private Little War,building,Narrator,,"Your next improvement. Notice what we've done to the striker. See how it holds the priming powder more securely? Fewer misfires. When I return, we will give you other improvements. A rifled barrel."
45,2,A Private Little War,building,Apella,,What?
45,2,A Private Little War,building,Krell,,A way to shoot further and straighter.
45,2,A Private Little War,village,Mccoy,,"Jim. Coal for forge, sulphur for gun powder."
45,2,A Private Little War,village,Kirk,,Let's take a look inside.
45,2,A Private Little War,forge,,A big bellows runs straight into the base of the fire.,
45,2,A Private Little War,forge,Kirk,,"Well, here's your forge. People's exhibit number one. A chrome steel drill point."
45,2,A Private Little War,forge,Mccoy,scanning,"This pig iron is almost carbon-free. That village furnace certainly didn't produce it. People's exhibit number two. Cold-rolled gun barrel rod fashioned to look homemade. You were right about the Klingons, Jim. KIRK: Make recorder and scanner tapes of everything."
45,2,A Private Little War,forge,Mccoy,,Right. It's a pity we can't include a live Klingon. That'd just about wrap it
45,2,A Private Little War,forge,,He is interrupted by voices from outside. They hide.,
45,2,A Private Little War,forge,Apella,,Is it difficult to cut grooves into the barrels?
45,2,A Private Little War,forge,Krell,,It's quite simple. I'll show you.
45,2,A Private Little War,forge,,Apella and Krell enter the forge.,
45,2,A Private Little War,forge,Apella,,"I thought my people would grow tired of killing. But you were right. They see that it is easier than trading and it has pleasures. I feel it myself. Like the hunt, but with richer rewards."
45,2,A Private Little War,forge,Krell,,"You will be rich one day, Apella, beyond your dreams. The leader of a whole world. A governor in the Klingon Empire."
45,2,A Private Little War,forge,,Then McCoy's scanner whistles. So Kirk jumps the Klingon while McCoy hits Apella with the steel rod he took.,
45,2,A Private Little War,forge,Kirk,,Bones!
45,2,A Private Little War,forge,,"They open the door, but there are two more armed villagers outside. Nevertheless, they knock them out and get away.",
45,2,A Private Little War,village,Krell,,Guards! Intruders!
45,2,A Private Little War,village,Kirk,to Tyree,Move! Fast!
45,2,A Private Little War,village,,Shots are fired as the three run for their lives out of the village.,
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,,Spock starts gasping for air.,
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Spock,,Nurse.
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Chapel,,Yes?
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Spock,,Hit me. The pain will help me to consciousness. Hit me.
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Chapel,,Hit you? No! I can't
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Spock,,"Blast you, strike me! If I don't regain consciousness soon, it may be too late. Hit me. (she slaps his face) Harder!"
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,,"She does, with tears in her eyes.",
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Spock,,Again. Continue. The pain will help me to consciousness.
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Scott,running in and dragging her away,"What are you doing, woman?"
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Chapel,,Leave me alone!
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Scott,,Have you gone daft?
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Chapel,,Mister Spock needs me! Let go!
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,,"M'Benga rushes in and helps Spock to sit up before giving him some pretty vicious hits across the face. Scott stares, astonished. Finally Spock grabs M'Benga's arm.",
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Spock,,"That will be quite enough. Thank you, doctor."
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,M'Benga,,"Please, release her."
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Scott,,What's this all about?
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Spock,,"She was doing as I requested, Mister Scott. A Vulcan form of self-healing."
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,M'Benga,,"As you saw, they must wait until the last possible moment then fight their way back to consciousness."
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Chapel,,"Here, let me help you, Mister Spock."
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Spock,,"Thank you, nurse. I'm quite fully recovered."
45,2,A Private Little War,sickbay,Chapel,,"Yes, I see you are."
45,2,A Private Little War,tyree's camp,,"Just slightly away from the tents, Kirk is giving a rifle shooting lesson.",
45,2,A Private Little War,tyree's camp,Kirk,,"Men, this is the pan. This is the hammer. The hammer striking the pan causes a spark, ignites the powder, and fires the flintlock. Now aim it as I showed you. Hold your breath and squeeze the trigger gently. (Tyree shoots the clay pot target) Well done. Very, very, very good."
45,2,A Private Little War,tyree's camp,Mccoy,,"Jim, I want to talk to you."
45,2,A Private Little War,tyree's camp,Kirk,,"Not here, Bones. In the cave. Yutan, your turn."
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Mccoy,,Do I have to say it? It's not bad enough there's one serpent in Eden teaching one side about gun powder. You want to make sure they all know about it!
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Kirk,,Exactly. Each side receives the same knowledge and the same type of firearm.
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Mccoy,,"Have you gone out of your mind? Yes, maybe you have. Tyree's wife, she said there was something in that root. She said now you can refuse her nothing."
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Kirk,,Superstition.
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Mccoy,,Is it a coincidence this is exactly what she wants?
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Kirk,,"Is it? She wants superior weapons. That's the one thing neither side can have. Bones. Bones, the normal development of this planet was the status quo between the hill people and the villagers. The Klingons changed that with the flintlocks. If this planet is to develop the way it should, we must equalize both sides again."
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Mccoy,,"Jim, that means you're condemning this whole planet to a war that may never end. It could go on for year after year, massacre after massacre."
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Kirk,,"All right, Doctor! All right. Say I'm wrong. Say I'm drugged. Say the woman drugged me. What is your sober, sensible solution to all this?"
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Mccoy,,I don't have a solution. But furnishing them firearms is certainly not the answer.
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Kirk,,"Bones, do you remember the twentieth century brush wars on the Asian continent? Two giant powers involved, much like the Klingons and ourselves. Neither side felt could pull out."
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Mccoy,,"Yes, I remember. It went on bloody year after bloody year."
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Kirk,,"What would you have suggested, that one side arm its friends with an overpowering weapon? Mankind would never have lived to travel space if they had. No. The only solution is what happened back then. Balance of power."
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Mccoy,,And if the Klingons give their side even more?
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Kirk,,"Then we arm our side with exactly that much more. A balance of power. The trickiest, most difficult, dirtiest game of them all, but the only one that preserves both sides."
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Mccoy,,And what about your friend Tyree? Will he understand this balance of power?
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Kirk,,No. Probably not. But I'm going to have to try and make him understand. I never had a more difficult task.
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Mccoy,,"Well, Jim, here's another morsel of agony for you. Since Tyree won't fight, he will be one of the first to die."
45,2,A Private Little War,cave,Kirk,,"Well, war isn't a good life, but it's life. His wife is the only way to reach him. If I tell her we're going to supply guns, maybe she'll convince him."
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Spock,,"Position, Mister Scott?"
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Scott,,"Entering distant orbit, sir. Approaching rendezvous time."
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Spock,,The Klingons?
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Chekov,,"They haven't spotted us yet, sir. Looks like they're beaming someone aboard."
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Spock,,Stand by to signal the captain.
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,,Kirk finds Nona near a stream which is running over a rock. She has been bathing. KIRK: Nona. Pardon me,
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,Nona,,You are here because I wished you here.
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,Kirk,,Oh? I thought it was my idea.
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,Nona,,Yes. They always believe they come of free will. Tyree thought the same when I cast my first spell on him.
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,Kirk,,Nona
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,Nona,,Can you smell this fragrance? Some find it pleasing.
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,,It is the same planet that she used on Tyree.,
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,Kirk,,I'd like to talk to you.
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,Nona,,Again. Some find it soothing. Yes.
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,Kirk,,I would like
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,Nona,,Happy. Yes. You feel good.
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,,"Tyree overhears her, and he is carrying a gun.",
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,Kirk,,"I feel dizzy. Yes, you are lovely. You're beautiful."
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,,Tyree takes aim.,
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,Nona,,Kiss me.
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,,"Kirk gives in, but Tyree cannot bring himself to squeeze the trigger. He throws the gun down in disgust and runs. Nona and Kirk are interrupted by the shriek of a mugato. Kirk is so besotted that Nona has difficulty getting out of his embrace and trying to escape. Eventually Kirk thinks to draw his phaser and kill the attacking creature. She decides to hit him over the head to get the phaser for herself.",
45,2,A Private Little War,tyree's camp,,Tyree returns.,
45,2,A Private Little War,tyree's camp,Mccoy,,"Where's Captain Kirk? Tyree, the firestick. Where is it?"
45,2,A Private Little War,tyree's camp,Tyree,,There! I left it there.
45,2,A Private Little War,tyree's camp,Mccoy,,That's a fine thing to leave lying around. Show us where it is.
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,,"Nona has just left when McCoy, Tyree and Yutan arrive. Yutan picks up the rifle.",
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,Tyree,,I do not want it.

45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,Kirk,,Nona.
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,,Nona greets a band of villagers.,

45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,) Man 1,,Tyree's woman.
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,Man 2,,She's a Kahn-ut-tu.
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,Man 1,,We won't trust this division to Apella.
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,Nona,,Take me to him. He will have the strength to use this new weapon.
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,,"Villager number one grabs Nona, and she slaps him off.",
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,Nona,,"Touch me again, and this small box will kill you."
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,,"They don't believe her, and all four men struggle with her",
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,,McCoy is about to give Kirk an injection to go with the headache pills.,
45,2,A Private Little War,countryside,Kirk,,"No, no. I'm all right. My phaser. She took it."
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,Nona,,This weapon I bring you is far greater than your firesticks.
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,,"Still, all the men want is to have their wicked way with her, and she screams. Kirk, Tyree and McCoy come running over the brow.",
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,Tyree,,Nona!
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,Man 4,,Hill people!
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,Man 1,,It's a trap. The woman's tricked us.
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,,"He stabs her. Another man shoots McCoy in the arm. Yutan fires back, then there is a good old-fashioned hand-to-hand struggle. Tyree smashes one man's head repeatedly with a large rock, until Kirk stops him. He goes to his wife.",
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,Mccoy,,She's dead.
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,,Tyree picks up a rifle.,
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,Tyree,,"I want more of these, Kirk. Many more! Yutan, two of those who killed my wife have escaped. Track them down. I will kill them."

45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,Mccoy,,"Well, you got what you wanted."
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,Kirk,,"Not what I wanted, Bones. What had to be. (McCoy hands him a communicator from his bag) Kirk here."
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,Narrator,,"SPOCK [OC] Spock, Captain. I trust all has gone well."
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,Mccoy,,"Spock, are you alive?"
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Spock,,"An illogical question, Doctor, since obviously you are hearing my voice."
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,Mccoy,,"Well, I don't know why I was worried. You can't kill a computer."
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,Kirk,,"Spock, ask Scotty how long it would take him to reproduce a hundred flintlocks."
45,2,A Private Little War,bridge,Scott,losing his grin,"I didn't get that exactly, Captain. A hundred what?"
45,2,A Private Little War,hillside,Kirk,,"A hundred serpents. Serpents for the Garden of Eden. We're very tired, Mister Spock. Beam us up home."

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Chekov,,Captain. what happened?
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Kirk,,It must be a transporter malfunction.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Chekov,,That was a rough trip.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Kirk,,This isn't Gamma Two. Look at the colour of that sky. (it's green)
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Uhura,,This is the craziest landing pad I've ever seen.

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,"I presume you mean they vanished in a manner not consistent with the usual workings of the transporter, Mister Scott."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,transporter room,Scott,,"Aye, of course I mean that. You think I'd call if they just beamed down?"
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,Have you reversed controls?
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,transporter room,Scott,,"I've made all the proper checks. There was nothing. There was no flash of light, nothing. They were gone."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,Power surge?
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,transporter room,Scott,,Not down here. All the dials were right and the transporter was functioning perfectly.

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Chekov,,"But Captain, if we're not on Gamma Two, then where are we?"
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Kirk,,That's what I'd like to know. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Dead.

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,,"People are approaching them. One big guy in a fur, with teeth that hold his mouth open, another male with a knife, a female in pink carrying a lance-like weapon, and another in silver with green hair.) KIRK: Phasers on stun. Fire. (nothing happens) Hand-to-hand",
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,,"The men go one-on-one while Uhura has to deal with both women simultaneously. They are not fairly matched. Chekov cannot handle the giant and Uhura quickly gives up. Only Kirk acquits himself well against the normal male, until green-hair intervenes with her weapon.",

While beaming down from the Enterprise to inspect facilities on Gamma Two, the normal transporter sequence has been interrupted, and we find ourselves on a strange and hostile planet, surrounded by creatures belonging to races scattered all through the galaxy."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,,A thin bald male in a long black cloak pops into the scene.,
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Galt,,"Excellent, Captain Kirk. Although we expected strength and competitive spirit, we are greatly pleased."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Kirk,,Either of you hurt?

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Galt,,"Admirable, Chekov. Admirable. You also, Uhura. Your spirit is as great as the captain's. I can see you all will prove invaluable here. I am Galt, Master Thrall of the planet Triskelion. I have been sent to welcome you."

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cell,Kirk,,"These Providers of yours, are they"
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cell,Galt,,"Correction, Captain. The Providers are not ours. We are theirs."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cell,Kirk,,What do they want from us?
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cell,Galt,,"You are to be trained, of course. What other use is there for thralls?"
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cell,Kirk,,Thralls? You must be mistaken. We're officers of a United spaceship on Federation business.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cell,Galt,,"There has been no mistake. Your old titles mean nothing here, Captain. You are thralls now. You are to be taken to the training enclosure. (the restraints are released) Come. Places have been prepared for you."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cell,Kirk,,We're not going anywhere until we have some information. Who are you? What is this place? What do you think you're going to do with us?
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cell,Galt,,"I am Galt, the Master Thrall. This place is the planet Triskelion. You are to be trained and spend the rest of your lives here."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Scott,,"Mister Spock, I've checked that transporter from one end to the other. Every circuit works perfectly. Whatever that power surge was, it had nothing to do with the transporter or any other system aboard this ship."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,"I'm beginning to believe that, Mister Scott. I've conducted two sweeps of the planet's surface. There is no sign of life."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Mccoy,,Then what the devil is happening? Does that mean their atoms are just floating around out there?
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,"No, Doctor. Even that would show up on our sensors."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Scott,,Where are they then?
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,"The only answers are negative. No magnetic storms, no ionic interference, no breakdown in your equipment."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Mccoy,,"A negative attitude is no good to us. We can't just leave them out there, wherever they are."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,"We shall continue sensor scans, Doctor. At the moment, that is all we can do, except hope for a rational explanation."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Mccoy,,"Hope? I always thought that was a human failing, Mister Spock."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,"True, Doctor. Constant exposure does result in a certain degree of contamination."

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,"I have never heard of a study being done, but it would be a fascinating project."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Mccoy,,"Fascinating? Those people are friends of ours out there, if they're still alive."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,Precisely.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Mccoy,,The odds are not good.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,No. I would say approximately four hundred

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,"I would welcome a suggestion, Doctor, even an emotional one, as to where to look."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Mccoy,,"First time you've ever asked me for anything, and it has to be an occasion like this."

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,accommodation block,Lars,,I have been selected for you.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,accommodation block,,The shadow play tells all we need to know. And the screams.,

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,Interesting. It seems to be an ionisation trail.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Mccoy,,"What would account for that, Spock?"
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,"Exactly the question I have just fed to the computers, Doctor. And the answer is, nothing known to us would account for it."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Scott,,"Well, the transporter has neither the power nor the range to account for that."

It is less painful than the collar. Turn around. {Lars ties Kirk's hands.) Captain, you will be practice target. It is a shame to lose you, Captain, but it is worth it as an example to the others."

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,Kirk,,"Oh. well, it's good to get away from that development area, even for a while. Shahna, why do the Providers, why do they like to watch others being hurt, killed?"
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,Shahna,,That is the way.

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,Shahna,,I have looked at them.

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,Shahna,,What is love?
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,Kirk,,Love is the most important thing on Earth. Especially to a man and a woman.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,Shahna,,"We, too, have mates. When it is time to increase the herd, my Provider will select one for me."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,Kirk,,"On Earth, we select our own mate. Someone we care for. On Earth, men and women live together, help each other, make each other happy."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,Shahna,,I do not think your words are allowed.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,Kirk,,All right. All right. Tell me about the Providers. What do they look like? Where do they live?

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,Kirk,,"Stop it. Stop it! I'm responsible! I made her talk! Stop it! You're killing her! She did nothing wrong! It was my fault. If you want to punish someone, punish me! Please."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,One,,"Is that what you humans call compassion? It is interesting, but it has no value here. You present many interesting aspects, Captain, but you must learn obedience. Then you will be an excellent thrall."

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,Kirk,,"It's all right. It's all right. You can stop crying now, Shahna. It's all right."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,Shahna,,You risked bringing their anger on yourself. Why did you do it?
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,Kirk,,It's the custom of my people to help one another when we're in trouble.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,,He kisses her.,
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,Shahna,,And this. Is this also helping?
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,Kirk,,You could call it that.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,Shahna,,"Please, help me once again. (another kiss) I did not know it could be like this between people. Is it always so in the place you come from?"
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,ruins,Galt,popping out of thin air,"Captain, you do indeed present many surprises. Because you have amused the Providers, there will be no punishment. Return to your quarters."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,"Mister Scott, can we manage anything faster than warp six?"
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Scott,,"It's my opinion that we've gone too far as it is, sir."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Mccoy,,"He's right, Spock. We've lost Jim and the others on Gamma Two. Now you've dragged us a dozen light years on some wild hunch that"
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,"Doctor, I do not respond to hunches. No transporter malfunction was responsible for the disappearance. They were not within the Gamma system. A focused beam of extremely high-intensity light was directed into the Gamma system from the trinary system we are now approaching. No known natural phenomena could have caused that beam. Does that clarify the situation?"
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Mccoy,,"No, it doesn't. It's still a fancy way of saying that you're playing a hunch. well, my hunch is that they're back on Gamma Two dead or alive and I still want another search."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Scott,,"Doctor McCoy speaks for me, too, sir."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,"I see. (pause) Gentlemen, I am in command of this vessel, and we shall continue on our present course. (conspiratorial whisper) Unless it is your intention to declare a mutiny."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Scott,,Mister Spock!
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Mccoy,,"Who said anything about a mutiny, you stubborn, pointed-eared. All right. If we don't find them here, do we still have another search on Gamma Two?"
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,"Agreed. Mister Scott, could you manage warp seven?"
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Scott,,"I would be more than content to do so, sir, and maybe a wee bit more."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,"Ensign, warp seven."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,kirk's cell,,Shahna brings a nourishment tray.,
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,kirk's cell,Kirk,,You're disturbed about what happened today.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,kirk's cell,Shahna,,"Yes. You have made me feel strangely. If it were allowed, I would ask that you have another drill thrall."

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,accommodation area,Kirk,,What about Lars?
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,accommodation area,Uhura,,He's gone to report me. I said I didn't like the food.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,accommodation area,Kirk,,"I think Galt is the only one who controls these collars. If we can find the phaser that I threw at Lars, we can use the circuits to short out these collars."

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, at least that gives our landing force a starting point."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,"There will be no landing force, Doctor. Assuming the captain and the others are still alive, it would be unwise to endanger them by beaming down a large contingent."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Mccoy,,Well we're not going to leave them there while we just sit and wait.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,Interesting. No power source. It may be shielded.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Mccoy,,And it may be just a wild goose chase like we've been telling you.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,"I shall beam down, Doctor. If I am unable to communicate, a landing party may be necessary."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, Mister Spock, if you're going into the lion's den, you'll need a medical officer."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,"Daniel, as I recall, had only his faith. But I welcome your company, Doctor. Mister Scott, you'll be in command."

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,One,,"Commendations, gentlemen. Your ingenuity in discovering the whereabouts of your companions is noteworthy."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Kirk,,"What you're hearing, gentlemen, is a Provider."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,One,,We are known to the thralls as Providers because we provide for all their needs. The term is easier for their limited mental abilities to comprehend.

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Spock,,Fascinating.

46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,One,,Your species has great curiosity.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,One,,We knew that. You are interesting in many ways.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Kirk,,But you are afraid.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,One,,You present no danger while you wear the collar
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,One,,And you wear it as long as you live.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Kirk,,Then show yourselves.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,One,,There is no objection.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,,"It is vast, obviously constructed with ceiling lights and a power plant in the background. In the foreground is a transparent dome with three yellow brains in it.",
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,The power source. Shielded by solid rock.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,One,a brain pulsates red,We are one thousand of your metres beneath the surface.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,Primary mental evolution. Incredible.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Two,pulsing green,"That is not true, Captain. Once we had humanoid form, but we evolved beyond it."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Three,yellow,"Through eons of devoting ourselves exclusively to intellectual pursuits, we became the physically simple, mentally superior creatures you see before you."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,"A species that enslaves other beings is hardly superior, mentally or otherwise."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,One,,"The thralls are necessary to the games. We have found athletic competitions our only challenge, the only thing which furnishes us with purpose."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,"It's an unproductive purpose, unworthy of your intellect."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,One,,We use only inferior beings.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,We have found that all life forms in the galaxy are capable of superior development. Perhaps you're not as evolved as you believe.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Three,,"An interesting speculation, Captain. You and your people are most challenging."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Two,,"Yes, most challenging. It was hoped that such new blood would stimulate our stock of thralls. How unfortunate that you must be destroyed."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,"Our destruction will result only in your own. You may control the Enterprise, but you cannot match the force of the entire Federation."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,One,,Your ship will be destroyed by a magnetic storm. No communications with your base will be possible. Your fate will remain a mystery to your people.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,And you call yourselves superior! You're murderers without the spirit to really wager for the lives you take.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,One,,"Wager? Explain yourself, Captain."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,"My people pride themselves on being the greatest, most successful gamblers in the universe. We compete for everything. Power, fame, women, everything we desire, and it is our nature to win. And for proof, I offer you our exploration of this galaxy."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Three,,"We are aware of your competitive abilities, Captain."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,"Well, then, I wager that with weapons of your own choice, right here and now, my people can overcome an equal number of thralls set against us."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Three,,A hundred quatloos on the newcomers.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,One,,Four hundred quatloos against the newcomers.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Two,,Two hundred quatloos against!
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Three,,Five hundred for the newcomers. Contest by multiple elimination.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,Wait! Wait! Hear me! We can't wager for trifles like quatloos. The stakes must be higher.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,One,,"Name your stakes, Captain."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,"If we win, the Enterprise and its crew leaves here in safety. Further more, all the thralls on the planet must be freed."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Two,,Anarchy. They would starve.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,You will educate and train them to establish a normal self-governing culture.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Three,,Thralls govern themselves? Ridiculous!
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,We have done the same with cultures throughout the galaxy. Are you willing to admit that we can do something you can't?
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Two,,There is nothing we cannot do!
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,One,,"And if you lose, Captain?"
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,"If we lose? We will remain here, the entire crew of the Enterprise. The most stubborn, determined competitors in the universe. We'll become thralls, enter your games, obey your orders without rebellion. You'll be assured of generations of the most exciting wagering you've ever had."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,One,,"Your stakes are indeed high, Captain."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,Not for true gamesters.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Three,,We will accept your stakes on one condition.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,Name it.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,One,,"As leader of your people, your spirit seems most indomitable. We suggest you alone, pitted against three contestants of our choosing."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,Three against one? Those are pretty high odds.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Two,,"Not for true gamesters, Captain."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,"Your, your terms are unfair."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,One,,"On the contrary, they're extremely fair, since your alternative is death."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,Kirk,,"Well, in that case, I'll accept your terms."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,cavern,One,,Galt will prepare you.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,,"Lars has a net, Kloog has his whip, and an Andorian has the pole weapon, same as Kirk.",
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,One,,"Because you wager your skill for all your people, they will be permitted to watch the outcome of the game on the ship's viewscreen."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Scott,,"Mister Spock, look!"
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,One,,"Captain, you will defend. Thralls must stay in the blue area. You will take the yellow. Touching an opposing colour deprives a contestant of one weapon. An opponent must be killed to be removed from the game. If only wounded, he is replaced by a fresh thrall. Is that clear, Captain?"
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Kirk,,"Yes, that's clear."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Mccoy,,What in the name of heaven is this?
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,bridge,Scott,,Heaven's got very little to do with this.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,,"So the fight begins, and everyone puts their feet outside their allotted colours from time to time. Kirk manages to trip up or push over each of his three opponents several times. Eventually he throws his pole into Kloog's belly then picks up a dagger to defend himself with. Lars traps his hand in the net, but Kirk ducks as the Andorian throws his pole. Now the two fight with just the daggers, until Kirk throws the Andorian. Galt sees that he is only injured, and orders in his replacement.",
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Galt,,Shahna.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,,She enters the area with a pole.,
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Shahna,,You lied. Everything you said.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,,"She trips him, but he grabs the pole and pulls her down to the point of his dagger. They both hesitate, break free, and she gets him at her mercy. Again there is hesitation, so Kirk uses his legs to grab her and this time puts the blade firmly to her throat.",
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Shahna,,The thralls surrender!
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,,Kirk lets her go.,
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,One,,"You have won, Captain Kirk, unfortunately. However, the terms of the wager will be honoured. You are free. Remove your collars."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,,They come off easily.,
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Kirk,,The thralls will be trained?
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,One,,They will be trained. We have said it.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Kirk,,"I think you'll find it a much more exciting game than the one you've been playing. I'm sorry, Shahna. I didn't lie. I did what was necessary. Someday, I hope you'll understand."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Shahna,,"I understand, a little. You will leave us now?"
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Kirk,,Yes.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Shahna,,To go back to the lights in the sky?
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Kirk,,Yes.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Shahna,,I would like to go to those lights with you. Take me?
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Kirk,,I can't.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Shahna,,"Then teach me how, and I will follow you."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Kirk,,"There's so much you must learn here first. The Providers will teach you. Learn it, Shahna. all your people must learn before you can reach for the stars. Shahna. (he gives her a farewell kiss) Scotty!"
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Scott,,"Aye, sir."
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Kirk,,Beam us up.
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,,They disappear in a twinkle.,
46,2,The Gamesters Of Triskelion,combat area,Shahna,,"Goodbye, Jim Kirk. I will learn, and watch the lights in the sky, and remember."
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,,Kirk and Spock are standing by a large purple boulder.,
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Spock,,"Our scanner survey was correct, Captain. There it is. Pure tritanium."

47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Spock,,We're in the growing season in this hemisphere of this planet. There are doubtless many pollen aromas.
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Kirk,,Rizzo.
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Rizzo,,"Yes, sir?"
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Kirk,,"Take your men. Make a swing around our perimeter. Scan for dikironium in the atmosphere. Set your phasers on disrupter-B. If you see any gaseous cloud, fire immediately. You're on Red Alert. Make a sweep."
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Scott,,"Ready to beam back aboard, Captain?"
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Kirk,,"Negative, Scotty. We're checking something out."
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Scott,,"The USS Yorktown is expecting to rendezvous with us in less than eight hours, Captain. That doesn't give us much time."

47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Spock,,"Captain, dikironium exists only in laboratory experiments."
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Kirk,,It's gone. I could have been wrong. The last time I caught an odour like that was eleven years ago.
47,2,Obsession,clearing,,The three red-shirts have run into a clearing.,
47,2,Obsession,clearing,Rizzo,,"Seemed to read dikironium for a minute, and then I lost it. It's almost like something out there knows I'm scanning it. It kind of keeps changing itself into something different. That isn't possible. Nothing can do that."

47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Kirk,,Hold your position.
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Scott,,"Cutting in if I may, Captain. The USS Yorktown is expecting to rendezvous with us in less than seven hours."
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Kirk,,Then you'll inform them that we might be a little late.
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"Jim, the Yorktown's ship surgeon will want to know how late. Those vaccines he's transferring to us are highly perishable."
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Spock,,"Spock again, Captain. Those medical supplies are badly needed on planet Theta Seven. They are expecting us to get them there on time."
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Kirk,,"Gentlemen, we are remaining in orbit until I find out more about those deaths, on my responsibility. I am perfectly aware that it might cost lives on Theta Seven. Kirk out. Autopsy report."
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,You saw their colour. There wasn't a red corpuscle left in their bodies.
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Kirk,,"Marks, cuts, incisions of any kind?"
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,Not a one. What happened is medically impossible.
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Kirk,,I suggest you look at the record tapes of past similar occurrences. You'll find the USS Farragut lists casualties eleven years ago from exactly the same impossible causes.
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"Thank you, Captain. I'll check those tapes immediately."
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Kirk,,"First, can you bring Ensign Rizzo to consciousness for a moment?"

47,2,Obsession,sickbay,Kirk,,Rizzo. This is the captain. Can you hear me? Do you remember what happened to you?
47,2,Obsession,sickbay,Rizzo,,Remember. I'm cold. I'm so cold.
47,2,Obsession,sickbay,Kirk,,"You were attacked by something. When it happened, did you notice an odour of any kind? Rizzo. Rizzo! Do you remember a sickly sweet odour? Did you smell it?"
47,2,Obsession,sickbay,Rizzo,,Yes. Yes. A smell. A strange smell. It was like being smothered in honey.
47,2,Obsession,sickbay,Kirk,,"Did you feel a presence, an intelligence?"
47,2,Obsession,sickbay,Rizzo,,"It was trying to draw strength from us. I felt it. It was, it was, it was there."
47,2,Obsession,sickbay,Mccoy,,He's beginning to sleep again. I can't risk another shot.
47,2,Obsession,sickbay,Kirk,,He's already told me what I wanted to know.
47,2,Obsession,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I wouldn't depend too much what he says in that half-conscious state. He could be dreaming, saying what he thought you wanted to hear."
47,2,Obsession,sickbay,Kirk,,You check those record tapes. I want your medical analysis as quickly as possible. (leaves)
47,2,Obsession,sickbay,Chapel,,What's with the captain? I've never seen him like that before.
47,2,Obsession,sickbay,Mccoy,,I intend to find out. I'll be in the medical record library.

47,2,Obsession,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,Spock?
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Spock,,Continuing scanning. Still no readings of life forms on the planet.
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,Let's assume that it's something so completely different that our sensors wouldn't identify it as a life form.
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Spock,,"You mentioned dikironium, Captain."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,"Suppose it was composed of that rare element. A strange, gaseous creature."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Spock,,"I've scanned for that element, Captain. There's no trace of dikironium on the planet surface or in the atmosphere."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,"Suppose it camouflaged itself. Let's assume that it's intelligent, that it knows we're looking for it."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Spock,,"To hide from a sensor scan, it would have to be able to change its molecular structure, like gold changing itself to lead or wood changing itself to ivory."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,You've just suggested something that never occurred to me. It may provide some answers to a tape record which I think you'll find Doctor McCoy is looking at this very moment.
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Spock,,"Chekov, take over on scanner."

47,2,Obsession,bridge,Garrovick,,"Yes, sir."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,Was your father
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Garrovick,,"Yes, sir, but I don't expect any special treatment on that account."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,"You'll get none aboard this ship, Mister."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Garrovick,,"Yes, sir."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, I have a report on Ensign Rizzo. He's dead, sir."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,You knew Rizzo?
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Garrovick,,"Yes, sir. We were good friends, graduated the Academy together."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,You'll get a crack at what killed him. Interested?
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Garrovick,,"Yes, I am, sir."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,I want four men armed with phaser two set for disrupter effect. Join me in the transporter room in five minutes. You'll accompany me to the planet surface.

47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Garrovick,,"Reading is changing, sir."
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Kirk,,Spock was right. Notice the molecular shift?
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Garrovick,,"Dikironium reading now, sir. Bearing ninety four mark seven, angle of elevation six degrees. Holding steady."
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Kirk,,"Over that rise. Take two men, circle around to the left. I'll take the other two and go the other way. That creature is dangerous. If you see it, fire full phasers."

And I, I am now even more convinced that this is not only an intelligent creature, but the same which decimated the crew of the USS Farragut eleven years ago in another part of the galaxy. Both Spock and McCoy are doubtful of this, and I sense they also doubt my decision to stay and fight the thing. Why am I keeping the ship here?"

47,2,Obsession,briefing room,Garrovick,,"I'd say it measured from ten to sixty cubic metres, sir. It varied in size, fluctuated as it moved."
47,2,Obsession,briefing room,Spock,,Composition?
47,2,Obsession,briefing room,Garrovick,,"It was like a, a gaseous cloud. Parts of it I could see through. Other parts were more dense."

47,2,Obsession,briefing room,Garrovick,,"Did I what, sir?"
47,2,Obsession,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Did you get any subconscious impressions that this was a creature. A living, thinking thing, rather than just a strange cloud of chemical elements?"
47,2,Obsession,briefing room,Garrovick,,"No, sir."
47,2,Obsession,briefing room,Kirk,,"But you didn't come to actual contact with it, did you?"
47,2,Obsession,briefing room,Garrovick,,"No, sir. I was furthest away from it. It seemed to come out of nowhere, hovered for a moment, then moved toward my men. It was fast, incredibly fast."
47,2,Obsession,briefing room,Kirk,,Did you say it hovered?
47,2,Obsession,briefing room,Garrovick,,"Yes, sir."
47,2,Obsession,briefing room,Kirk,,"You did fire at it, didn't you?"

47,2,Obsession,briefing room,Kirk,,What exactly were you doing?
47,2,Obsession,briefing room,Garrovick,,"Well, I was startled for a second. And then by the time I fired, the thing was already moving."

47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,Scanner readings?
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Chekov,,"Nothing, sir. Continuing to scan."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,Are you aware it can change its molecular structure?
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Chekov,,"Yes, sir."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,Are you scanning for any unusual movement?
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Chekov,,"Yes, sir."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,Any type of gaseous cloud?
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Chekov,,We've run a full scanner probe twice.

47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"Interrupting another autopsy report is no disturbance, Mister Spock. It's a relief."
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Spock,,I need your advice.
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,Then I need a drink.
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Spock,,I do not understand your reasoning.
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,You need advice from me? You must be kidding.
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Spock,,"I do not joke, Doctor. Perhaps I should rephrase my statement. I require an opinion. There are many aspects of human irrationality I do not yet comprehend. obsession, for one. The persistent, single-minded fixation on one idea."
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,Jim and his creature?
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Spock,,Precisely. Have you studied the incident involving the USS Farragut?
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"No. With all these deaths and injuries, I've only had a chance to scan the tapes. There are eight or ten hours of record tape there."
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Spock,,"Fortunately, I read somewhat faster. In brief, Doctor, nearly half the crew and the captain were annihilated. The captain's name was Garrovick."
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,The same as our Ensign.
47,2,Obsession,mccoy's office,Spock,,"His father. Among the survivors was a young officer on his first deep-space assignment, James T. Kirk. And there is still more. I suggest you study this."

47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Personal log, stardate 3620.7. Have I the right to jeopardise my crew, my ship for a feeling I can't even put into words? No man achieves Starfleet command without relying on intuition, but have I made a rational decision? Am I letting the horrors of the past distort my judgment of the present?"
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,Mind if I come in?

47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Chekov,,"Continued scanning, sir. No unusual readings."
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Maintain search. Kirk out. It can't have just vanished.
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Sometimes they do, if we're lucky. Monsters come in many forms. You know the greatest monster of them all, Jim? Guilt."
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Get to the point.
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Jim, When a young officer is exposed to unknown dangers for the first time, he's under tremendous emotional stress. Now we all know that."
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Ensign Garrovick is a ship-command decision. You're straying out of your field, Doctor."
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,,He returns to his bed.,
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Am I? I was speaking of Lieutenant James T. Kirk of the starship Farragut. Eleven years ago, you were the young officer at the phaser station when something attacked. According to the tapes, this young Lieutenant Kirk insisted upon blaming himself."
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Because I delayed in firing at it.
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,You had a normal emotion. You were startled. You delayed firing for a grand total of perhaps two seconds.
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"If I hadn't delayed, it would have been killed."
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,The ship's exec didn't seem to think so. His log entry was quite clear on the subject. Lieutenant Kirk is a fine young officer who performed with uncommon bravery.
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Don't you understand? It killed two hundred crewmen.
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Captain Garrovick was very important to you, wasn't he, Jim?"
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Yes. He was my commanding officer from the day I left the Academy. One of the finest men I ever knew. I could have killed that thing if I'd fired soon enough the first time.
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"You don't know that, Jim. You don't know that any more than you know that Garrovick could have destroyed it."
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"I can't help how I feel. There's an intelligence about it, Bones. A malevolence. It's evil. It must be destroyed."
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,To be so obsessed.
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Obsessed?
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"That you could destroy yourself, your career, a young boy who reminds you of yourself eleven years ago."
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Don't push our friendship past the point where I have to take official
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"I'm not, Jim. This is professional, Captain. I am preparing a medical log entry on my estimation of the physical and emotional condition of a starship captain. Which requires a witness of command grade."
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,,McCoy goes to the door and opens it to admit Spock.,
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Do I take it, Doctor, Commander, that both of you or either of you consider me unfit or incapacitated?"
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"Correctly phrased, Captain. As recommended in the manual. Our reply, also as recommended, is, sir, we have noted in your recent behaviour certain items, which, on the surface, seem unusual. We respectfully ask permission to inquire further"
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Blast it! Forget the manual! Ask your questions.
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"Sir, the USS Yorktown is waiting now at the rendezvous point. It carries perishable drugs"
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Skip the recitation, Spock. I know the facts."
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"They need those vaccines on Theta Seven, Captain. Now why are we delaying here?"
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Because I'm convinced that this is the same creature that attacked the Farragut eleven years ago.
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"Creature, Captain?"
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"My report is on the tapes. As it attacked us eleven years ago, as I lost consciousness, I could feel the intelligence of the thing. I could sense it thinking, planning."
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"You say you could sense its intelligence, Captain? How did it communicate with you?"
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,You state that it happened just as you lost consciousness. A semiconscious mind is a very tricky thing. A man never knows how much is real or how much is imagination.
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Whatever it is, Doctor, whatever it is, wouldn't you call it deadly?"
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Yes, there's no doubt about that."
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,And what if it is the same creature that attacked eleven years ago from a planet over a thousand light years from here?
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"Obviously, Captain, if it is an intelligent creature, if it is the same one, if it therefore is capable of space travel, it could pose a great threat to inhabited planets."
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"A lot of ifs, I agree, but in my command judgment, they out weigh other factors. Intuition, however illogical, Mister Spock, is recognized as a command prerogative."
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Jim, we're not trying to gang up on you."
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"And you haven't, Doctor. You've expressed the proper concern, you've asked the proper questions. You've both done your duty. Now may I ask what medical log entry you intend to make?"
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"At this point, my medical log remains open."
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"In that case, gentlemen"
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Chekov,,Bridge to Captain. Come in.
47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Kirk here.

47,2,Obsession,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"All decks, Red Alert. Red alert. Prepare to leave orbit."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Scott,,"Captain, we can't maintain warp eight speed much longer. Pressures are approaching the critical point."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,"Range, Mister Chekov?"
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Chekov,,"Point zero four light years ahead. Our phasers won't reach it, sir."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Spock,,"We are barely closing in on it, Captain. We could be pursuing it for days."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,"If necessary. Do what you can to increase our speed, Scott."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, sir."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,"Extreme magnification, Mister Chekov."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Chekov,,"Magnification twelve. There, sir. Got it."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,"Spock, how do you read that?"
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Spock,,"Conflicting data, Captain. It seems to be in a borderline state between matter and energy. Elements of both. It could possibly use gravitational fields for propulsion."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,"And you don't find that sophisticated, Mister Spock?"
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Spock,,"Extremely efficient, Captain. Whether that indicates intelligence is another matter."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Chekov,,Open hatch on impulse engine number two. Mister Scott was doing an AID clean-up on it.
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,We won't be using the impulse engines. Turn the alarm off.
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Chekov,,"Aye, sir."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Scott,,"Captain, we can't do it. If we keep this speed, we'll blow up any minute now."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,,"Scott looks frantic, Spock almost concerned, everyone else is worried. Kirk looks as if he might burst into tears of frustration.",

47,2,Obsession,garrovick's quarters,Chapel,,Doctor's orders.
47,2,Obsession,garrovick's quarters,Garrovick,,What's happening?
47,2,Obsession,garrovick's quarters,Chapel,,Are we still chasing that thing half way across the galaxy? Yes. Has the captain lost his sense of balance? Maybe. Is the entire crew about ready to explode? Positively. You're lucky you're out of it.
47,2,Obsession,garrovick's quarters,Garrovick,,"What do you mean, out of it? I caused it. You know that, too, don't you? If I'd fired my phaser quickly enough on Argus Ten, this wouldn't have happened."
47,2,Obsession,garrovick's quarters,Chapel,,"You know, self-pity's a terrible first course. Why don't you try the soup instead?"
47,2,Obsession,garrovick's quarters,Garrovick,,"I told you, Christine, I'm not hungry."
47,2,Obsession,garrovick's quarters,Chapel,,"Doctor McCoy thought you might say something like that. This is his officially logged prescription for you. It has one word on it. Eat. Now if you don't follow his orders, Doctor McCoy could and possibly would have you hauled down to Sickbay and fed intravenously."

47,2,Obsession,bridge,Chekov,,I don't understand. It was outrunning us.
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,Maybe it's decided to fight. Phasers ready?

47,2,Obsession,bridge,Scott,,That's impossible.

47,2,Obsession,briefing room,Spock,,May I suggest that we no longer belabour the question of whether or not we should have gone after the creature. The matter has now been rendered academic. The creature is now after us.

47,2,Obsession,briefing room,Spock,,"It turned and attacked, Doctor. Its method was well-considered and intelligent."

47,2,Obsession,briefing room,Spock,,"Captain, the creature's ability to throw itself out of time sync makes it possible for it to be elsewhere in the instant the phaser hits. There is therefore no basis for your self-recrimination. If you had fired on time and on target eleven years ago, it would have made no more difference than it did an hour ago. Captain Garrovick would still be dead. The fault was not yours, Jim. In fact, there was no fault."

47,2,Obsession,garrovick's quarters,Spock,,"Ensign, am I correct in my assumption that you've been disturbed by what you consider to be a failure on your part? (a nod) I would like you to consider that the hesitation for which you are blaming yourself is an hereditary trait of your species. When suddenly faced by the unknown or imminent danger, the human will experience a split second of indecision. He hesitates. Do I have your attention, Ensign?"

47,2,Obsession,garrovick's quarters,Spock,,"Kindness, Mr. Garrovick, is another human emotion, and I believe we have enough of that. I simply would like you to accept the fact that your reaction has its basis in physio. (suddenly stops and sniffs) Do you smell something?"

47,2,Obsession,corridor,Mccoy,,"I'll bet he left a bad taste in the creature's mouth, too."
47,2,Obsession,corridor,Spock,,"Colloquially expressed, but essentially correct."
47,2,Obsession,corridor,Kirk,,Yes. The scent is different. I think I understand something now.
47,2,Obsession,corridor,Spock,,Do you believe you're in communication with the creature?
47,2,Obsession,corridor,Kirk,,"I don't know what it is, Mister Spock, but you remember I said the thing was alive. It may not be communication as we understand it, but I did know it was alive and intelligent, and I think I know something else now."

47,2,Obsession,corridor,Kirk,,"Very commendable, Ensign. What was your impression of the battle?"
47,2,Obsession,corridor,Garrovick,,"I don't understand, sir."
47,2,Obsession,corridor,Kirk,,I'm asking for your military appraisal of the techniques used against the creature.
47,2,Obsession,corridor,Garrovick,,"Ineffective, Captain. I realise, Captain, you did everything you could do. I know that. It's just that nothing works against a monster that can do the things that thing does."
47,2,Obsession,corridor,Kirk,,"And Ensign, what is your appraisal of your conduct on the planet?"
47,2,Obsession,corridor,Garrovick,,I delayed firing.

47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,"Report, Mister Chekov."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Chekov,,"Results positive, Captain. The creature has left the ship at high warp speed and is already nearly out of scanner range. The way that thing can move, Captain, I wouldn't believe it."

47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,"In Garrovick's quarters, I said the scent of the creature was somehow different. Something in my mind said home."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Spock,,"And you know where home is, Captain?"

47,2,Obsession,bridge,Mccoy,,I assume that you now believe we should pursue the creature and destroy it.
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Spock,,Precisely.
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,You don't agree with Mister Spock?
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Mccoy,,It's the time factor that bothers me. Those drugs are perishable.
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Spock,,"Doctor, evidence indicates the creature is here to spawn. If so, it will reproduce by fission, not just into two parts, but thousands."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,Antimatter seems our only possibility.
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Spock,,An ounce should be sufficient. We can drain it from the ship's engines and transport it to the planet surface in a magnetic vacuum field.
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,Contact medical stores. I want as much haemoplasm as they can spare in the transporter room in fifteen minutes.
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Garrovick,,"Yes, sir."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Mccoy,,I presume you intend to use that haemoplasm to attract the creature?
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,We must get it to the antimatter. It seems attracted to red blood cells. What better bait could we have?
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Spock,,"There is still one problem, Captain."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,"The blast, yes."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Spock,,Exactly. A matter-antimatter blast will rip away half the planet's atmosphere. If our vessel is in orbit and encounters those shock waves
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,"A chance we'll have to take, Mister Spock."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Spock,,"Also, we cannot be certain the transporter will operate under those conditions. If a man is beaming up when that hits, we may lose him."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,That's exactly why I've decided to set the trap myself.
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, there is so little hemoglobin in my green blood, the creature could not harm me extensively. It therefore seems logical for me to be the one"
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,"Negative, Mister Spock. In case this plan fails, I'll need you aboard the ship. In that event, we'll need another plan."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Spock,,It will require two men to transport the antimatter unit.
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Garrovick,,"I'd like permission to go with you, sir."
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Kirk,,"I had you in mind, Mister Garrovick."
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,,"Kirk, Garrovick and a blue ball under a floating carrying device beam down.",

47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Spock,,"Spock here, Captain."
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Kirk,,Proceed immediately to maximum orbit.
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Spock,,Acknowledged.
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Garrovick,,"Just think, Captain, less than one ounce of antimatter here is more powerful than ten thousand cobalt bombs."
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Kirk,,Let's hope it's as powerful as man will ever get. Detonator.
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Garrovick,,"Aye, sir."
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,,He primes and sets it on the anti-grav unit.,
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise.
47,2,Obsession,bridge,Spock,,"Spock here, Captain. Holding at thirty thousand kilometres."
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Kirk,,Antimatter container positioned and armed. I'll call you back when it's baited. Kirk out.
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Garrovick,,"Captain, look!"
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,,The cloud is already over the bottle of blood. Within moments it is empty.,
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Garrovick,,The haemoplasm. The bait's already taken.
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Kirk,,We'll need something else for bait.
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Garrovick,,"Sir, that thing only feeds on blood."
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Kirk,,"Garrovick, get back to the ship. Tell them to prepare to detonate."
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Garrovick,,"Captain, you're not going to be the bait."
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Kirk,,"I said, get back to the ship. Ensign, I gave you an order."
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Garrovick,,"Yes, sir."
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,,A quick karate chop knocks Kirk down but not out. He lands a couple of punches on Garrovick.,
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Kirk,,"Consider yourself on report. This is no time for heroics. I have no intention of sacrificing myself, at least not yet. (into communicator) Spock? Spock?"
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Spock,,Spock here.
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Kirk,,"Scan us and lock on to us. It's going to be close. Very, very close. Stand by. Stand by, Enterprise."
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,,The cloud approaches.,
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Garrovick,,"I can smell it, Captain. It's sickening. Honey sweet."
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,Kirk,,"Stand by, Enterprise. (The cloud reaches them) Now! Energise and detonate!"
47,2,Obsession,planet surface,,BANG!,
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,,Spock and Scott are at the controls with McCoy watching.,
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,Spock,,Reset. Energise.
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,Chekov,,"All decks, stand by. Shock waves."
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,,"The ship is shaken, and still nothing appears on the transporter pad.",
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,Mccoy,,Do something.
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,Spock,,"We are, Doctor. Cross-circuiting to A."
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,Scott,,"Got them. A piece of them, anyway."
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,Spock,,Cross-circuiting to B.
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,Mccoy,,"Crazy way to travel, spreading a man's molecules all over the universe."
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,,Finally the swirly bits solidify into two men.,
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,Scott,,"Captain, thank heaven."
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,Spock,,"Mister Scott, there was no deity involved. It was my cross-circuiting to B that recovered them."
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,Mccoy,,"Well then, thank pitchforks and pointed ears. As long as it worked, Jim."
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,Kirk,,"That's a fair statement, Bones. Now that the creature is dead, let's save some lives. We'll deliver your medicine. Bridge, this is Kirk."
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,Uhura,,Uhura here.
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,Kirk,,"Have Mister Chekov lay in a course for a rendezvous with the Yorktown, maximum warp."
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,Kirk,,"Oh, Ensign, meet me in my quarters when you've cleaned up. I'd like to talk to you about your father. Several tall stories I think you'd like to hear."
47,2,Obsession,transporter room,Garrovick,,"Thank you, sir. I would."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 4307.1. Approaching Starbase Six for a much needed period of rest and recreation."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"The crew has performed excellently, but is exhausted. And I, too, am looking forward to a nice period of rest on some lovely planet."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,Captain. There was a message from Starbase Six. Heavy interference. All I get is Intrepid and what sounded like a sector co-ordinate.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,Interesting. No indications of magnetic storms in this sector.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Try another channel, Lieutenant."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,"The Intrepid is manned by Vulcans, isn't it?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, that's right, Bones."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,Enterprise calling Starbase Six. Enterprise calling Starbase Six. Come in. Come in.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,"Spock suddenly jerks upright, his face a picture of horror.",
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Spock?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,"What is it, Spock? Are you in pain?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, the Intrepid. It just died. And the four hundred Vulcans aboard, all dead."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,"Come on, Spock, let's go down to Sickbay."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"Doctor, I know what I know."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Get to the Sickbay.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,Captain.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"No, no, no. That's an order."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"Yes, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,McCoy leads him away.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, I have Starbase Six readable now. Switching to audio, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Kirk here. Go ahead.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Starbase,,You will divert immediately to sector three nine J.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Sir, the Enterprise just completed an exhausting mission. We're on our way in for R and R. There must be another starship in that sector."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Starbase,,"Negative. This is a rescue priority. We've lost all contact with solar system Gamma Seven-A, which the Intrepid was investigating. And we've just lost contact with the Intrepid. Report progress."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Order acknowledged. Kirk out. Mister Kyle, you heard the order. Set course for Gamma Seven-A, warp five."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kyle,,"Aye, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,Captain I have just completed a full long-range scan of Gamma Seven-A system. It is dead.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Dead? It's a fourth magnitude sun. There are billions of inhabitants there.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,It is dead.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,,"Spock is on a biobed, being scanned.",
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Spock,,"I assure you, Doctor, I am quite all right. The pain was momentary. It passed quickly."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Mccoy,,"All of my instruments seem to agree with you if I can trust these crazy Vulcan readings. Spock, how can you be so sure the lntrepid was destroyed?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,,Spock gets off the bed.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Spock,,I sensed it die.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Mccoy,,But I thought you had to be in physical contact with a subject before
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Spock,,"Doctor, even I, a half-Vulcan, could hear the death scream of four hundred Vulcan minds crying out over the distance between us."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Mccoy,,Not even a Vulcan could feel a starship die.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Spock,,"Call it a deep understanding of the way things happen to Vulcans, but I know not a person, not even the computers on board the Intrepid, knew what was killing them or would have understood it had they known."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Mccoy,,But four hundred Vulcans?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Spock,,"I've noticed that about your people, Doctor. You find it easier to understand the death of one than the death of a million. You speak about the objective hardness of the Vulcan heart, yet how little room there seems to be in yours."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Suffer the death of thy neighbour, eh, Spock? You wouldn't wish that on us, would you?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Spock,,It might have rendered your history a bit less bloody.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Spock, you may have been right. We've lost contact with the Intrepid and we're out of communication with an entire solar system. Any update from Starfleet?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,"I cannot filter out the distortion, sir. It's getting worse."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kyle,,"Captain, deflector shields just snapped on."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Slow to warp three.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kyle,,"Warp three, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,Indications of energy turbulence ahead. Unable to analyse. I've never encountered readings like this before.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Scanners on. Magnification three on the screen.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kyle,,"Magnification factor three, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,"Exactly what are we looking for, Mister Spock?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,I would assume that.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,In the middle of the viewscreen is a black blob.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,What is that?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,Perhaps an interstellar dust cloud.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"Not very likely, Ensign."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"No. You'd be able to see stars through a dust cloud. Looks like a hole in space. Readings, Mister Spock."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"Still not able to analyse, Captain. Sensors are feeding data to the computers now. Whatever this dark zone is, it lies directly in line with the course I calculate for the Intrepid and the Gamma Seven-A system."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Hold present course. Slow to warp one.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kyle,,"Warp factor one, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov, prepare to launch a telemetry probe into that zone. Direct computer feed to Mister Spock."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,"Aye, sir. Probe ready. Switching data feed to library computer."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Launch probe.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,"Probe launched, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,A high pitched sound comes over the speakers.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,What was that?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,"The telemetry probe, sir. There's no signal from it."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Speculation, Spock."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"I have none, Captain. Insufficient data."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,Chekov is still groaning and Uhura looses her balance.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,Lieutenant.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,"I'm just dizzy. I'll be all right. I'm fine, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,Sickbay to Captain Kirk. McCoy here.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Kirk here. What is it?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,I'm getting reports from every deck. Half the people on this ship just fainted.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Uhura almost did. She says she's all right. Do you want to see her?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,Not unless she's feeling ill. I've got an emergency here.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Kirk,,What's wrong?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,,"Crew are queued out of the door, getting shots from Chapel.",
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Mccoy,,"There's nothing organic. They all seem to be nervous, weak, and irritable. They say it happened suddenly, like a balloon popping."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Kirk,,"Can you handle it, Bones?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Mccoy,,I'm giving them stimulants to keep them on their feet.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,"Yeah, we can handle it, Jim."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Good. Kirk out. Hold our position, Mister Kyle."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kyle,,"Aye, aye, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Spock, give me an update on the dark area ahead."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,No analysis due to insufficient information.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"No speculation, no information, nothing. I've asked you three times for information on that, and you've been unable to supply it. Insufficient data is not sufficient, Mister Spock. You're the science officer. You're supposed to have sufficient data all the time."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"I am well aware of that, Captain, but the computers contain nothing on this phenomenon. It is beyond our experience, and the new information is not yet significant."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"I don't know about you but I'm tired. If you can't tell me what it is, let's use reverse logic. Perhaps it'll help if you tell me what it isn't."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"It is not liquid, gaseous, or solid, despite the fact we cannot see through it."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,So far that's not much help.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"It is not a galactic nebula such as the Coal Sack, and since our deflectors were activated by it, it would seem to be some form of energy, but nothing our sensors can identify."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Is it possible that this is what killed that solar system and the Intrepid?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,Very possible.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Lieutenant.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Notify the Starfleet that we're going to attempt to probe the area of darkness to gain further information.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, aye, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,"Kirk pauses, exhausted on his way back to his chair.",
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,Captain?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"I'm all right. Distance from zone of darkness, Mister Kyle?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kyle,,"One hundred thousand kilometres, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Ahead slow. Impulse power only.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kyle,,"Aye, aye, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,"Transmission to Starfleet complete, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Very good. Time, Mister Chekov?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,"Penetration of the zone in one minute, seven seconds, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Red Alert. Deflectors full power. Phaser banks ready.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,"Phasers standing by. Deflectors at full power, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,That eardrum splitting sound comes again.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,"It's not coming from communications, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Spock!
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"Analysing now, Captain."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,The sound goes.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,"Captain, the stars are gone!"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,The viewscreen is completely blank.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Malfunction, Mister Spock?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"Negative, Captain. All systems functioning properly."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Then kindly tell me what happened to the stars.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"Unknown, Captain."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Kirk to McCoy.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,McCoy here.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Things any better down there?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,Worse. They're backed up into the corridor.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Have you got anything that will help up here? I don't want anybody folding on the bridge at a critical moment.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,On my way. McCoy out.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Kirk to Engineering. Scotty, there was a power loss. How come?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Scott,,"We lost five percent of our energy reserve, sir. Our deflector shields are weakened."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Kirk,,Can you compensate for the loss?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Scott,,"Aye, if we don't lose any more. Don't ask me how it happened."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"I am asking how, mister. I want answers. Kirk out."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,"McCoy enters with a nurse, and starts injecting the crew.",
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,What's that?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,A stimulant.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Bones, how bad is it?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,Two thirds of the personnel are affected.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Why? How? Do you have any answers?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,"No. You know you'll get everything I can tell you. But when there is nothing, what should I say?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,The man at the engineering station collapses.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,Nurse.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"This ship is in trouble. We'd better start solving problems faster than we pick up new ones. We seem to be in the middle of a creeping paralysis. Mister Spock, analysis of that last burst of noise before we started losing power."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"That sound was turbulence caused by the penetration of a boundary layer, Captain."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,What boundary layer?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,Unknown.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Boundary layer between what and what?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,Between where we were and where we are.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Are you trying to be funny, Mister Spock?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"It would never occur to me, Captain."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Do you have any ideas, Spock?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"We still have no specifics, but we seem to have entered a zone of energy which is incompatible with our living and mechanical processes. As we draw closer to the source, it grows stronger and we grow weaker."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Recommendations.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,I have one. I recommend survival. Let's get out of here.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"This is the Captain. We're on a difficult mission, but it's not the first time. Our orders do not say stay alive or retreat."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Kirk,,Our mission is to investigate.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Kirk,,"We're sick, and we're getting sicker."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"We have no guarantees, but we have a good ship and the best crew in Starfleet. So do your jobs. Carry on. Kirk out."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,Sickbay to Captain Kirk.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,mccoy's office,Kirk,,"Kirk here. Go ahead, Bones."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"Jim, according to the life indicators, the energy levels"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, say it, Bones."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"According to the life monitors, we're dying."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,We're all dying.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 4308.8. It is now ten minutes since we entered the zone of darkness. We have stopped engines while we seek a defence against the energy drain which seems to pervade the zone."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,,Kirk enters and is promptly thrown sideways by a massive jolt to the ship.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Kirk,,Are you all right?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Scott,,Yes.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Kirk,,What was that?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Scott,,"I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure. I was trying to recalibrate, and we went into reverse."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Kirk,,Reverse? But that was a forward lurch. How could that happen in reverse thrust?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Scott,,"I don't know, sir. All I know is that the power levels are down twelve percent and steadily decreasing. I've never experienced anything like it."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Spock,,Bridge to Captain Kirk.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Kirk,,Kirk here.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"Sir, we are accelerating. We are being pulled toward the centre of the zone of darkness."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"By what, Spock?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"Unknown, Captain. I suggest you order Mister Scott to give us reverse power."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Kirk,,He just gave us reverse power. We lurched forward.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"In that case, Captain, I would suggest we apply forward thrust."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Chapel,,Doctor. Life function indicators. They've started a sharp drop again.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Mccoy,,Stimulants. I don't know how long we can keep this up.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Kirk,,"What do you think, Scotty? Forward thrust?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Scott,,"I don't know, sir. It goes against the rules of logic."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Kirk,,"Yes, doesn't it? Well, if it doesn't work, I'll never let Spock live it down. Notch it into forward."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Scott,,But
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Kirk,,Go ahead.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Scott,,"That's doing it, sir. We're slowing down. But we're not stopping. We're still being dragged forward."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Kirk,,Have one of your engineers monitor the instruments. Keep applying thrust against the pull.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Chapel,,"Doctor, they seem to be stabilising."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Mccoy,,"But at a dangerously low level. Well, we're still alive. I suppose that's something."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Mccoy,,"All I can contribute is the further we travel into this zone of darkness, the weaker our life functions become, and I have no idea why. I'm all right. It's those stimulants. They catch up with you."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Kirk,,Engineering.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Scott,,"As to the power levels are concerned, everything is acting backwards, but the drain is continuing. On the static test, I could only get sixty percent power. We're still being dragged forward."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Kirk,,Spock.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Spock,,"It's logical to assume that something within this zone absorbs all forms of energy whether mechanically or biologically produced. Whatever it is, it would seem to be the same thing which drew all the energy out of an entire solar system and the Intrepid."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Kirk,,"The same thing, not the zone itself?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Spock,,"I would say not, Captain. The analysis of the zone indicates it is a negative energy field, however illogical that may sound, but it is not the source of the power drain."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Kirk,,Maybe it's a shield of some kind. Some form of protection for something else.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Scott,,But what?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Kirk,,"We'll find out what it is, but we'd better get out of here ourselves. Scotty, channel all the impulse and warp power into one massive thrust forward. That might snap us out of the zone."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Scott,,"Aye, Captain, but I'll reserve some for the shields in case we don't get out."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Spock,,"I submit, Mister Scott, if we do not get out, the shields would be extraneous. It would only prolong our wait for death by a short period of time."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Kirk,,"Use whatever power is necessary to get us out of here, Scotty. Report to your stations, continue your research. Dismissed."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,,The department heads leave Kirk and Spock alone.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Spock,,"Captain, the Intrepid would have done all these things too, and yet they were destroyed."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Kirk,,"Well, they may not have done all of these things. You just pointed out how illogical this situation is."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Spock,,True. It is also true they never knew what was killing them. Their logic would not have permitted them to believe they were being killed.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Kirk,,Explain.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Spock,,Vulcan has not been conquered within its collective memory. The memory goes back so far that no Vulcan can conceive of a conqueror. I knew the ship was lost because I sensed it.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Kirk,,What was it you sensed?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Spock,,The touch of death.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Kirk,,And what do you think they felt?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,briefing room,Spock,,Astonishment.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,,Scott is working on the upper level,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Scott,,That ought to do it. Engineering to Captain Kirk.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Kirk here. What is it, Scotty?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Scott,,"Ready to try it when you are, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Do we have the power to pull it off, Scotty?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"I hope so, Captain."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Stand by. All hands, this is the captain. We are slowly being pulled deeper into the zone of darkness by an unknown force. We're going to apply"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,sickbay,Kirk,,All available power
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Kirk,,Into one giant forward thrust
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"In the hope that it will yank us out of the zone. Prepare yourselves. All right, Scotty. Let's get on with it."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,Everybody braces themselves against the g-forces that are created by the acceleration. What happened to the inertial dampers? Then there's a sudden jolt and people get thrown around. Chapel is flung into McCoy's arms for example.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Scotty!
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"It's no good, sir. The best we can do is to maintain thrust against the pull and hold our position."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Are we still losing power?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Scott,,"Aye, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Kirk,,How long will the power hold out?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Scott,,"At this rate, plus the drain on all systems, two hours."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Maintain thrust, Scotty. While we're maintaining our distance, Mister Spock, have you ascertained yet what we're maintaining our distance from?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"I cannot say what it is, Captain, but I would say it has found us."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,The viewscreen is no longer black. It contains a multicoloured image rather like an abalone.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Prepare to launch a probe, Mister Chekov."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,"Aye, sir. Probe ready for launch, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"Getting very confused readings, Captain, but this is definitely the source of the energy drain."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Launch probe.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,"Probe launched, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,Probe will impact in seven point three seconds.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kyle,,"Six, five, four, three, two, one."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,The ship shudders.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Are we still in contact with the probe?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,"Yes, sir. Data being relayed to Mister Spock."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"Readings coming in now, Captain. Length, approximately eleven thousand miles. Width varying from two thousand to three thousand miles. Outer layer studded with space debris and waste. Interior consists of protoplasm, varying from a firmer gelatinous layer to a semi-fluid central mass. Condition, living."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Magnification four.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,"Magnification four, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"That is what is drawing us toward it, Captain. The same way it drew the Intrepid to her death."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,,There is an image of a single-celled organism on a screen.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Mccoy,,That is an amoeba.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Kirk,,"Yes, I remember my basic biology, Doctor. You mean to tell me that that thing is a giant single-celled animal?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Mccoy,,"Yes, for lack of a better term. It's a very simple form of life. In fact it's a much simpler form of life than what you're looking at now. But that thing can apparently perform all the functions that qualify it as a living organism. It can reproduce, it can breathe, it can eat, although I don't know what."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Spock,,"Energy itself, perhaps, drained from us. I would speculate that this unknown life form is invading our galaxy like a virus."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Kirk,,The Intrepid died of that particular virus. How is it we survived?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Spock,,"The Intrepid must have come across the organism while it was still low in energy, still hungry. We are not safe, Captain. We merely have a little more time than the Intrepid did."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Kirk,,What about this zone of darkness? Does the organism generate it itself as a form of protection?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Mccoy,,It's one of the things we've got to find out. We've got to take a closer look at it.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Kirk,,"The closer we get, the faster our energy drains out. We're barely surviving at this distance."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Mccoy,,Perhaps we could risk the shuttlecraft. Perhaps with a protective shield
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Kirk,,"I'm not sending anyone anywhere. Unmanned probes can give us the information we need to destroy this thing, if it can be destroyed."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Spock,,"I must differ with you, Captain. We have sent unmanned probes into it. They have given us some information but they have not told us what we need to know, and we cannot afford the power to take blind shots at it, hoping to kill it."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Mccoy,,"We could send one man in, pinpoint its vulnerable spots."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Kirk,,DO you know what the odds are in coming back? I can't order a man to do that.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Mccoy,,"Who said anything about an order, Jim? You've got a volunteer. I've done the preliminary work."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Kirk,,It's a suicide mission.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Spock,,The thing evidently has reflexes. The unmanned probe we sent in must have stung it when it entered. The lurch we felt was the turbulence of its reaction.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Mccoy,,"All right, so I'd know enough to go slow when we penetrated its vulnerable spots."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Spock,,"You have a martyr complex, Doctor. I submit that it disqualifies you."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Mccoy,,Do you think I intend to pass up the greatest living laboratory since
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Spock,,The Vulcans saw it first and died.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Mccoy,,Just because the Vulcans failed
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Spock,,I am more capable.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Kirk,,"Gentlemen, I am not taking volunteers."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Mccoy,,You don't think you're going?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Kirk,,I'm better qualified as a command pilot than you are.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Spock,,"Which makes you indispensable, Captain. Further, you are not a science specialist."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Mccoy,,"Jim, that organism contains chemical processes we've never seen before and may never see again. We could learn more in one day"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Spock,,"We don't have one day, Doctor. We have precisely one hour and thirty five minutes of power left."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Mccoy,,Jim
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Spock,,"Captain, I"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,laboratory,Kirk,,"Gentlemen, I'll decide."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Captain's personal log, stardate 4309.2. We have established that the thing which destroyed the USS Intrepid and the Gamma Seven=A system is an incredibly huge but simple cellular being whose energies are totally destructive to all known life. Both Mister Spock and Doctor McCoy have volunteered to go in a specially equipped shuttlecraft to penetrate the cell, find a way to destroy it, and free the ship. Doctor McCoy has the medical-biological knowledge. Mister Spock is better suited physically and emotionally to stand the stress. Both are right, both are capable, and which of my friends do I condemn to death? This is the captain. Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy, report to my quarters immediately. Kirk out."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Scott,,Engineering to Captain Kirk.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Kirk,,Kirk here.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,engineering,Scott,,You asked me to keep you informed on the power drain. All levels are down fifty percent now
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Scott,,And still draining. We can maintain thrust for another hour and fifteen minutes.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,,Spock and McCoy enter.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Very well. Prepare the shuttlecraft for launching.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Scott,,Sir?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Doctor McCoy will tell you what special equipment to put in. Kirk out. I'm sorry, Mister Spock."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Right. I'll get a few things I need, Jim."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Not you, Bones. I'm sorry, Mister Spock. You're best qualified to go."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,corridor,Spock,,"Do not suffer so, Doctor. This is not the first time superior capability has proven more valuable than professional credentials."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,corridor,Mccoy,,"Nothing has been proven yet, Spock. The DNA code analyser will give you the fundamental structure of the thing. You'll need readings on three light wavelengths from the enzyme recorder."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,corridor,Spock,,"I am familiar with the equipment, Doctor. We're wasting time. The shuttlecraft is ready."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,corridor,Mccoy,,"You're determined not to let me share in this, aren't you?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,corridor,Spock,,"This is not a competition, Doctor. Whether you understand it or not, grant me my own kind of dignity."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,corridor,Mccoy,,Vulcan dignity? How can I grant you what I don't understand?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,corridor,Spock,,Then employ one of your own superstitions. Wish me luck.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,corridor,,"Silence and stares, then McCoy opens the hangar deck door. Spock walks across and into the Galileo. The doors shut.",
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,corridor,Mccoy,,"Good luck, Spock."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,All systems clear for shuttlecraft launch. sir.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Launch shuttlecraft.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kyle,,"Shuttlecraft away, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant Uhura, channel automatic telemetry directly to the computers."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, aye, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,Shuttlecraft to Enterprise.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Come in, Spock."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,shuttlecraft,Spock,,Power drain is enormous and growing worse.

48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Spock.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"I heard, Captain."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,shuttlecraft,Spock,,We discussed that possibility earlier. But you will need this information.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,shuttlecraft,Kirk,,When do you estimate penetration?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,shuttlecraft,Spock,,Slowing now. Contact in eighteen point three seconds. Brace yourselves. The area of penetration will no doubt be sensitive. Contact
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,In six seconds.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,"Spock is thrown around in the shuttlecraft, everyone on the ship just feels a jolt.",
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Report, Mister Spock. Spock, report."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"I am undamaged, Captain. Relay to Mister Scott I had three percent power reserve before the shields stabilised."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"There was nothing to spare. I shall continue my tests. Oh, and Doctor McCoy. You would have not survived it."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,You want to bet?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"I am moving slowly now, establishing course toward what appears to be the nucleus."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,"Sir, Mister Spock has reduced life-support systems to bare minimum."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Spock, save your power for the shields."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,Calculations indicate the shields will last only forty seven minutes.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"However, I am able to identify the chromosome structure."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,shuttlecraft,Spock,,Changes indicate the organism has stored sufficient energy for reproductive process to commence.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,You mean there'll be two of those things?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,I'm having difficulty maintaining ship control.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Spock, do you read me? Spock, do you read me?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,I'm losing voice contact I will transmit internal co-ordinates of chromosome bodies.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Spock, come in. Come in."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,"Contact lost, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,The ship shakes.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,He's alive! He's kicked it in the side to let us know.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, I'm getting telemetry."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov, telemetry analysis as it comes in."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,"According to Spock's telemetry information, there are over forty chromosomes in the nucleus that are ready to come together, ready to reproduce."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"If the energy of that organism only doubles, we're dead, and everything within a light year will be defenceless."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, all I know is, that soon there'll be two, four, eight, and more. The entire anti-life matter that that thing puts out could someday encompass the entire galaxy."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Spock understood when he transmitted the co-ordinates of the chromosomes. We must destroy that organism.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"Captain, the pull from that organism is increasing, and the power drain from our shields is getting critical."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,How much time do we have?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"No more than an hour now, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Put all secondary systems on standby. Shield power has unconditional priority.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, I'm receiving a message from Mister Spock on a low-energy channel. It's faint, but it is readable."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Put it on, Lieutenant."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,"On audio, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,This is Spock.

48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,How do you feel?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,What's on your mind?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Spock. Is it me, Jim? Am I so sentimental that I just have to keep believing that he's still alive in that mass of protoplasm?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"He knew the odds when he went out there, just as you did when you volunteered to go. What is that thing out there, Bones? It's not intelligent. Not yet."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"It's a disease, like a virus invading the body of our galaxy."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Yes, it is, isn't it? How many cells does the human body have?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,Millions.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"This thing, this cell, this virus. It's eleven thousand miles long, and it's one cell. When it grows into millions, we'll be the virus invading its body."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Now, isn't that a thought? Here we are, antibodies of our own galaxy, attacking an invading germ. It would be ironic indeed if that were our sole destiny, wouldn't it?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Antibodies. Antibodies. (goes to desk monitor) Bridge.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Scott,,"Scott here, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Scotty, how much power do we have left?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"We're down to forty three percent, sir. We're slipping a bit against the pull that beastie's putting on us."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Scott,,"We can't last more than forty five minutes at this rate of decline. Less, if I have to apply more thrust."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"What would happen if you diverted all remaining power to the shields, except for impulse power, keep that in reserve?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"Cut the engine thrust? We'd be sucked into that thing like being caught in a wind tunnel, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Exactly. Prepare to divert power on my signal. Kirk out.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,,"Kirk leans against the monitor, tired. McCoy scans him.",
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Have you got something to say?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Technically, no. Medically, yes. Between the stimulants and the pressure, I would suggest you try to stay off your feet for a few minutes."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"I don't have a few minutes, Bones. Maybe none of us do. Let's go."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"All hands, this is the captain. We're going to enter the body of the organism rather abruptly, I would think. Damage control parties stand by. All decks secure for collision. Kirk out."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Ready, Scotty."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"Switching power to shields. Impulse in reserve. Cutting thrust to zero, now!"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kyle,,Impact five seconds.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,There's a big bump and people are thrown all over the place. Then there is calm.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,"We're through, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"I believe everybody is aware of that, Mister Chekov."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,"Damage control parties report minimal damage, sir. Repairs are being initiated."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Very good, Lieutenant."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"Captain, we've only twenty six percent power reserves after entry."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Do we have impulse power, Scotty?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"I saved all I could, sir, but I don't know whether we have enough to get back out again. Or time either."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,We are committed.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, we are, but we're committed to what? We have no power for the phasers."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,We couldn't use it. We'd cook ourselves along with that mess of protoplasm out there
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,That thing would probably like phasers. It eats power.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"Then what the devil, begging your pardon sir, are we doing?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Mister Spock was trying to tell us what to do when we lost voice contact.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,We can't use the power to destroy it.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Anti-power.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,What?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,This thing has a negative energy charge. Everything seems to work in reverse. We'll use anti-matter.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, it couldn't swallow that."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov, prepare a probe. Scotty, we'll need a magnetic bottle for the charge. How soon?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"It's on its way, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov, we'll use a timing detonator for the probe. Work out a setting."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,"Aye, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Helmsman, when do you estimate arrival at nucleus?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kyle,,"Seven minutes, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,How close are you going to it?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Point blank range. We'll implant it then back away.

48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"With the eddies and currents in that protoplasm, the probe could drift thousands of kilometres. We must be exactly on target, because we won't have a second chance. Bones, time for another stimulant."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,How long do you think you can keep taking that stuff? It'll blow you apart.

48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,Programming complete. Ready for launch.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Launch probe at zero acceleration. Forward thrust off, one tenth of a second."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kyle,,"Forward thrust off, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,"Probe launched, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,There's a little jolt.,
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,"Despite what Spock said, it's still plenty sensitive."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,"Probe confirmed. It is lodged in the nucleus, near the chromosome bodies."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Kyle, back us out the way we came in. Mister Chekov, a nice, straight line. Don't waste any time."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kyle,,"Backing out, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,Estimate we'll be out in six point thirty seven minutes.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Very good.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,"Captain, metallic substance outside the ship."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,Spock?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant, get me Spock's voice channel. Highest possible gain."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Uhura,,"Go ahead, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Spock, do you read me? Do you read me, Spock, do you read me? Come in, Spock. Spock! Scotty, get a tractor beam."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"Captain, we don't have enough time to do it. We only have a fifty three second escape margin."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"I'm well aware of that, Mister Scott. Get two tractor beams on that shuttlecraft."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, sir. Tractor beams on."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, I recommend you abandon the attempt."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,shuttlecraft,Spock,,Do not risk the ship further on my behalf.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,"Shut up, Spock! We're rescuing you."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Why, thank you, Captain McCoy."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kyle,,"Almost out. We're approaching the membrane, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Time until explosion?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,"Fifty seven seconds, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Maintaining tractor beams on shuttlecraft, Mister Scott?"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, sir. I can't guarantee it'll hold when the warhead explodes. The power levels are (looks at readout) The power levels are dead, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"You may have just written our epitaph, Mister Scott."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,,"The warhead must have exploded, because everyone goes flying around the bridge again.",
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Activate main viewing screen. (they see stars.) Mister Chekov, report."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Chekov,,"The organism is destroyed, sir. The explosion must have ruptured the membrane and thrown us clear."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"Power's coming back, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,Shuttlecraft?
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"I don't know how, sir, but it's still with us."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,shuttlecraft,Spock,,Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Request permission to come aboard.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Spock, you're alive!"
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,shuttlecraft,Spock,,"Obviously, Captain. And I have some fascinating data on the organism."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Mccoy,,"Don't be so smart, Spock. You botched the acetylcholine test."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Later, later, later. Bring the shuttlecraft aboard, Mister Scott."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, sir."
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kyle,,Prepare to receive shuttlecraft. Received shuttlecraft. Hangar doors closed. Hangar deck pressurising.
48,2,The Immunity Syndrome,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Starbase Six. Ahead warp factor five. I'm still looking forward to a nice period of rest and relaxation on some lovely (gazes at yeoman) planet."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Chekov,,"Approaching Sigma Iotia Two, Captain."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,"Standard orbit, Mister Chekov."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, I have received vocal contact from an official station. They relayed us to a man named Oxmyx. His title is Boss."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,"Boss? All right, Lieutenant, put him on. Oxmyx. This is Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the Federation of Planets."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Oxmyx,,"Hello, Captain. You're from the same outfit as the Horizon?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes. Unfortunately, the Horizon was lost with all hands shortly after leaving your planet. We only received her radio report last month."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Oxmyx,,Last month? What are you talking about? The Horizon left here a hundred years ago.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,Difficult to explain. We received a report a hundred years late because it was sent by conventional radio. Your system is on the outer reaches of the galaxy. They didn't have subspace communication in those days.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Oxmyx,,Toward the edge of what?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,"I'll explain it in more detail when I see him. The ship won't land, but we'll transport several people down. Well, that's a little difficult for you to understand, too. I'll explain it in more detail when I see you. Where will be convenient?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Oxmyx,,"Well, there's an intersection just at the end of the block, near a yellow fire plug. Think you can find it?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,,Kirk goes over to the engineering station.,
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,"Scotty, do you have the co-ordinates?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Scott,,"Located, sir."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Narrator,,"KIRK; Good. Mister Oxmyx, we have your intersection located. Will five minutes be all right?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Oxmyx,,Fine. Fine. I'll have a reception committee there to meet you.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,"Good. I'll be looking forward to it. Kirk out. Scotty, you have the conn."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,,McCoy and Spock enter from the turbolift.,
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,"Spock, McCoy, we're beaming down. Standard equipment."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,turbolift,Kirk,,The Horizon's contact came before the Non-Interference Directive went into effect.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,turbolift,Mccoy,,They must have interfered with the normal evolution of the planet.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,turbolift,Spock,,It will be interesting to see the results of the contamination.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,turbolift,Kirk,,We don't know there is contamination. The evidence is only circumstantial.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,turbolift,Mccoy,,What was the state of the Iotian culture before the Horizon came?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,turbolift,Kirk,,The beginnings of industrialisation.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,transporter room,Spock,,Horizon reports indicate the Iotians are extremely intelligent and somewhat imitative.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,transporter room,Mccoy,,So we're going down to recontaminate them.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,transporter room,Spock,,"The damage has been done, Doctor. We are here to repair it."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,transporter room,Kirk,,Let's not argue about it. Let's go study it. Energise.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,,"There's a yellow fire hydrant, litter, a girl in a 1930's dress, motor cars, shops, and men standing around carrying machine guns. Welcome to Chicago.",
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Spock,,Fascinating.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Mccoy,,This is like coming home.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kirk,,Home was never like this. I've seen pictures of the old days that look like this.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Spock,,"Interesting, Captain. Passers-by are carrying, I believe, firearms."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,,They are approached by two men in neat suits with machine guns.,
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kalo,in a brown suit,"Okay, you three, let's see you petrify."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Spock,,"Sir, would you mind explaining that statement, please?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kalo,,"I want to see you turn to stone. Put your hands over your head, or you ain't going to have no head to put your hands over."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,,They are deprived of their phasers and communicators.,
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kalo,,What's this?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kirk,,That's a weapon. Be careful with that.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kalo,,"A heater, huh? Hey, the boss will love that. (puts it in his pocket)"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kirk,,"Look, we were asked to come down here by Mister Oxmyx. He said"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kalo,,"I know what he said, bud. He said some of the boys would meet you. Okay, we're meeting you."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Mccoy,,"Well, those firearms are not necessary."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kalo,,You trying to make trouble?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Mccoy,,"Who, me?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kalo,,Don't give me those baby blue eyes.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Mccoy,,What?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kalo,,I don't go for that innocent routine.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Spock,,"Sir, does everyone here carry firearms?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kalo,,I never heard such stupid questions in my life.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Mccoy,,"Well, since this Oxmyx asked us down here, don't you think we should see him?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kalo,,All right. Get moving. Down the street.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,,"Just then a car comes hurtling around the corner. Everyone dives for cover, and gunfire rings out. The silent man in the blue suit gets shot. Kalo returns fire as the car speeds away.",
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kalo,,Krako's getting more gall all the time .
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kirk,,Is this how you greet all your guests?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kalo,,"It happens, pal."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Mccoy,,That man's dead back there.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kalo,,"Yeah? We ain't playing for peanuts. What's the matter, you guys never saw a hit before?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Spock,,"Sir, there are several questions I would like to ask."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kalo,,Ask the boss. I don't know nothing. Get moving.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,,They leave the crowd to deal with the deceased.,
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Mccoy,,"This is the contamination you're looking for, Jim."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kirk,,"Yes, but the Horizon crew wasn't composed of cold-blooded killers. They didn't report this culture in this state, either. What happened?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Woman,,"Hey, Kalo. Hey, when's the boss going to do something about the crummy street lights around here, eh? A girl ain't safe."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Woman 2,,And how about the laundry pickup? We ain't had a truck by in three weeks.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kalo,,Write him a letter.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Woman 2,,I did. He sent it back with postage due.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Woman,,"Listen, we pay our percentages. We're entitled to a little service for our money."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kalo,,"Get lost, will ya? Some people got nothing to do but complain."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kirk,,"Is this the way your citizens do business, their right of petition?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kalo,,They pay their percentages and the boss takes care of them.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,,"It's a lovely high-ceilinged room with wood paneling, tiled floor with a carpet and substantial furniture. A buzzer sounds.",
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,a silver haired man in a suit) Hit that button. (the girl sitting on his desk obeys,Yeah?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kalo,,"Got them, Boss. No sweat."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,All right. Bring them in. (he goes to the pool table and picks up a cue) Which one of you is the captain?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,Depends.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"Make yourself a drink, Captain. It's good stuff. I distill it myself."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,"No, thank you. You're Mister Oxmyx."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"That's me, pal."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,"This is my first officer, Mister Spock, Doctor McCoy."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"Doctor, huh? Put that chopper down, Kalo. These guys are our guests. Pick up a cue, Captain. Go ahead. You can't be too careful around here these days."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Mccoy,,"Yes. Judging from what we've seen so far, I agree."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,"They call you The Boss, Mister Oxmyx. The boss of what?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"The boss of my territory. I got the biggest in the world. You know, there's one thing wrong with having the biggest. There's always some punk trying to cut you out. That's why you can't be too careful."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,You're the government here?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"What government? Look, I told you. I got the territory and I run it. That's all."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,"But there are other bosses, other territories?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"Yeah, sure. Maybe a dozen or so, not counting the small fry, but then they get burned anyway soon as I get around to it."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Spock,,"Does that include, if I may ask, a gentleman called Krako?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,How do you know about Krako?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kalo,,"He hit us, Boss."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"Okay. You hit him back, you hear? Hard."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kalo,,I'll take care of it.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,,Spock has discovered a book on a lectern.,
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Spock,,Captain? Gangsters. Chicago. Mobs. Published in 1992. Where'd you get this?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"Hey, wait a minute. That's the Book."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,I know it's a book.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"The Book. They left it, the other ship. The Horizon."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Spock,,"This is the contamination, Captain. Astonishing. An entire culture based on this."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Mccoy,,"You said they were imitative, and the book"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,I don't want any more cracks about the Book.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,Did they leave any other books?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"Sure. Some text books on how to make radio sets and stuff like that, but, look, I brought you here so you could help me, not for you to ask me questions. After that, I'll answer anything you want to know."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,What is it you want?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"Well, I was thinking. You Feds must have made a lot of improvements since that other ship came here. You probably got all kinds of fancy heaters up there. So here's the deal. You give me all the heaters I need. Enough tools so I can knock off those punks all at once. Then I'll take over, and all you'll have to do is deal with me."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,Now let me get this straight. You want us to supply you with arms and assistance so you can carry out an aggression against your neighbours?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,What aggression? I got to make hits. I want you to help me hit them. That's all.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Spock,,"Fascinating, but quite impossible."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,"Mister Oxmyx, my orders are quite explicit. Under no circum"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"I ain't interested in your orders. From now on, you're gonna take orders from me. I'm gonna give you just eight hours to give me the things I want. If I don't have those tools by then, I'm gonna call up your ship and have them pick you up in a box. Is that understood, pal?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,,Kalo and another henchman put their guns to Kirk's head.,
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kalo,,"Hey, Boss, this here's a heater, and I don't know what this is. (tosses them to his leader)"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,Let's see how this thing works.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,Don't do that. You could knock out the side of the building.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"That good, huh? All you have to do is give me about a hundred of these fancy heaters and we'll have no more trouble."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,Out of the question.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"Captain Kirk, I usually get what I want. What's this thing? (silence) All right. Burn him."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,Hold it. It's a communication device.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,How does it work?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,It's locked onto my ship's systems.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"Kalo, take them to the warehouse and put them in a bag. Keep a sharp eye on them, you hear."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kalo,,"In the bag, Boss. Come on."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,,The landing party and the gunmen leave,
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,into communicator,"Hey, you. In the ship up there."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Oxmyx,,"Hey, you in the ship."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Scott,,Scott here. Who's this?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,This is Bela Oxmyx. I got your captain and his friends down here. You want to see them alive
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Oxmyx,,"Again you'll send me down a hundred of these fancy heaters you've got, and some troops to show me how to use them."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Scott,,Am I to understand that you're holding the captain and his party?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"You heard right, pal. I'm going to give you just eight hours to get me the goods I want, or I put the hit on your friends."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Oxmyx,,You understand?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Scott,,"I don't know. (Oxmyx ends the transmission, laughing) Lieutenant Hadley, check the language banks and find out what a heater is."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,,The guards are sitting at a makeshift table playing cards whilst the landing party sit on various barrels and crates.,
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Mccoy,,One book on the gangs of Chicago did all this. It's amazing.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Spock,,They evidently seized upon that one book as the blueprint for an entire society.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Mccoy,,It's the Bible.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kirk,,"In old Chicago, conventional government almost broke down. The gangs nearly took over."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Mccoy,,"Yeah, well, Oxmyx is the worst gangster of all."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Spock,,"We may quarrel with Mister Oxmyx' methods, but his goal is essentially the correct one. This society must become united or it will degenerate into total anarchy."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kirk,,"If this society broke down as the result of the Horizon's influence, then the Federation's responsible, and we've got to do something to straighten this mess out. Spock, if you could get to the sociological computer, do you think you could find a solution?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Spock,,"Unfortunately, I do not have access to my computers, nor are these gentlemen likely to permit it."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kirk,,"Well, I've got an idea about that. (goes over to the card table and gets guns pointed at him) Gentlemen. Gentlemen. This, card game is a kid's game."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kalo,,"You think so, huh?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kirk,,"Oh, yes, yes. I wouldn't waste my time."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kalo,,Who's asking you?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kirk,,"On Beta Antares Four, they play a real game. It's a man's game, but of course it's probably a little beyond you. It requires intelligence."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kalo,,"Listen, Kirk, I can play anything you can figure out. Take the cards, big man. Show us how it's played."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Spock,,I'm familiar with the culture on Beta Antares. There aren't games
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kirk,,"Spock. Spock. (sits) Of course, the cards on Beta Antares Four are different, but not too different. The name of the game is called fizzbin."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kalo,,Fizzbin?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kirk,,"Fizzbin. It's not too difficult. (begins dealing) Each player gets six cards, except for the player on the dealer's right, who gets seven."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kalo,,On the right.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kirk,,"Yes. The second card is turned up, except on Tuesdays."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kalo,,On Tuesday.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kirk,,"Oh, look what you got, two jacks. You got a half fizzbin already."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kalo,,I need another jack.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kirk,,"No, no. If you got another jack, why, you'd have a sralk."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kalo,,A sralk?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kirk,,"Yes. You'd be disqualified. You need a king and a deuce, except at night of course, when you'd need a queen and a four."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kalo,,Except at night.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kirk,,"Right. Oh, look at that. You've got another jack. How lucky you are! How wonderful for you. If you didn't get another jack, if you'd gotten a king, why then you'd get another card, except when it's dark, you'd give it back."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kalo,,If it were dark on Tuesday.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kirk,,"Yes, but what you're after is a royal fizzbin, but the odds in getting a royal fizzbin are astron. Spock, what are the odds in getting a royal fizzbin?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Spock,,"I have never computed them, Captain."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kirk,,"Well, they're astronomical, believe me. Now, for the last card. We'll call it a kronk. You got that?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,Kalo,,What?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,warehouse,,Kirk 'accidentally' drops the card on the floor,

49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Scott,,Captain. We're preparing everything. It'll be ready when you give the word.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,krako's office,Kirk,,"You may begin, Mister Scott."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,krako's office,Scott,,"Acknowledged, Captain."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,krako's office,Krako,,You mean you're going to start sending down your boys now?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,krako's office,Kirk,,Not exactly.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,krako's office,,"Krako is beamed away, and the astonished guards are easily overpowered again.",
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,krako's office,Kirk,,Right?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,krako's office,Spock,,Check.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,krako's office,,They leave.,

49,2,A Piece Of The Action,transporter room,Krako,,How the hell'd I get here? What? What happened? (Scott enters) You. You must be that Scott fellow Kirk was talking to. I want to know what happened.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,transporter room,Scott,,"It looks like we put the bag on you, doesn't it."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,transporter room,Krako,,I got rights.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,transporter room,Scott,,"You've got nothing. You mind your place, mister, or you'll be wearing concrete galoshes."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,transporter room,Krako,,You mean cement overshoes?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,transporter room,Scott,,Er. Aye.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,,Kirk runs towards the car.,
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Spock,,Must we?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kirk,,It's faster than walking.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Spock,,But not as safe.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kirk,,Are you afraid of cars?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Spock,,"Not at all, Captain. It's your driving that alarms me."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,Kirk,,"Spock, I've got the hang of it. Now go on."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,street,,"The machine guns are still where Spock left them in the open top car, and Kirk still puts it into reverse first.",
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,krako's office,Zabo,"waking up) Oh, not again. (rouses the other man) Hey, wake up. You all right? (opens the door","Hey, you guys. Come in here. The Feds snatched Krako. I never seen anything like it. They're going to move in unless we stop 'em now."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,krako's office,Guard,,Yeah? How?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,krako's office,Zabo,,"Well, Bela's mixed up in this somehow. I've got a sneaking hunch they're going to high-tail it back to his territory. You know what we're going to do? We're going to hit his place."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Mccoy,,Where are they?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"Knowing Krako, he'll probably send them back on a blotter."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,"Wrong again, Oxmyx."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Mccoy,,Jim.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,"Knock it off, Sawbones. I want to talk to this creep. Now listen, I'm getting tired of playing pattycake with you penny-ante operators."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"What do you mean, penny-ante operator?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,"You're a penny-ante operator. Sit down. All right, Spocko, cover him. Now listen, sweetheart. The Federation's moving in, taking over. You play ball, we'll cut you in. You don't, you're out. All the way out. You know what I mean?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"Yeah, sure. Why didn't you say so in the first place? All you had to do was explain it to me."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,transporter room,Scott,,"Enterprise. Scott here, sir."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,You got Krako on ice?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Scott,,"Aye, he's here. Mad enough"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,transporter room,Scott,,"To chew neutronium, but behaving himself."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,transporter room,Kirk,,"Okay, baby. Cool him till I flag you."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,transporter room,Scott,,Flag me?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,Keep him until I send for him. We're going to make some old-style phone calls from this locale. So you locate the man on the other end of the blower and give him a ride to this flop.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Scott,,What?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,Find the man at the other end of the phone
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,transporter room,Kirk,,And transport him to these co-ordinates.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,"Can do, sweetheart?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,transporter room,Scott,,"Can do, Captain."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Scott,,Standing by.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,Now you. Get on the blower and call the other bosses.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,I sure don't know what you think you're talking about.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,Get with it. I'm giving the orders here.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,Hello. Hello?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,Scotty?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Scott,,Scott here.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,Guess who?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,Lock in and energise.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"Yeah, you bet your life I've got a lot of nerve. What are you going to do about it?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Tepo,,Coming over with my boys and we (realises he's not where he was a second earlier) Mother.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"Hey, Captain, that ain't bad."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,Yeah.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Spock,,"I would advise you to keep dialing, Oxmyx."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,krako's office,Zabo,,All right. You know what to do. We hit Bela's place and nobody comes out alive. All right. Let's go.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,,It's getting crowded and noisy. The minor bosses are all sporting bowler hats. Krako is there too. Kirk is standing on the pool table.,
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,"All right! All right! All right! All right! Now the Federation's taking over whether you like it or not. You people, you've been running this planet like a piecework factory. From now on, it's going to be under one roof. You're going to run it like a business. That means you're going to make a profit."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Tepo,,And what's your percentage?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,I'm cutting the Federation in for forty percent. You got any objections?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Tepo,,"Yeah! I hear a lot of talk, but all I see here is you and a couple of your boys. I don't see no Federation."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Krako,,Listen. They got a ship. I know. I was there.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Tepo's got a point. All we ever seen is them.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Tepo,,"What, a couple of boys?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Krako,,I'm not going to believe my eyes.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,,general bedlam,
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,Hang on a minute. Hang on a minute. Quiet! Just a moment!
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Krako,,Let me say something. I only saw three guys in that ship. Maybe there ain't no more.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,There are over four hundred guys there.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Krako,,"That's your story, buster."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,,There's a gunfight outside in the street.,
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Krako,,"Hey, it's my boys. They're making a hit at this place."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,,Everyone dashes to the windows to watch.,
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,My boys will put you down.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Krako,,"Want to bet? (gets the gun off McCoy) Keep moving. One move out of you two, I'll drill them. Give me the hardware."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"Hey, that's great, Krako. Now we got hostages again. We can make a deal with the Feds up there."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Krako,,"Are you kidding? This one's all mine. From now on, nobody's going no place. I'm going to be the big boss in this here territory."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,"Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Get that heater down. Don't you want to take a look at what you're going to fight?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Krako,,"I already seen it. You're nothing, Fed."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,"All right, but at least let me call my ship one last time and say goodbye."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Krako,,"Well, all right. Go ahead. Don't get smart."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,"Hello, Scotty. This is Kirk."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Scott,,"Enterprise. Scott here, sir."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,"Scotty, put the ship's phasers on stun. Fire a burst in a one-block radius around these co-ordinates."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Scott,,"Right away, sir. Scott out."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,,"The street outside is filled with green light, and everyone falls down. The watching bosses are stunned into silence for a moment.",
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Krako,,"Gee, that's some trick."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"Hey, did you see that?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,"They're not dead, just knocked out for a while. But they might just as well have been that way if we wanted them to."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"Okay, okay, Kirk, so we get the message. Now, what was this syndicate deal you were talking about?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Tepo,,He was talking about a percentage.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,I was talking about both.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,"Okay. A syndicate makes sense to me. I'm a peaceful man at heart, but I'm sick and tired of all these hits. I hit Krako, Krako hits Tepo, Tepo hits me. There's too many bosses. We can't get anything done."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Narrator,,"I was thinking if there was just one, maybe somebody like you, as the top boss, then we can get things done."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,"Hey, Bela, no, no, no. The Federation can't get connected with a small-time operation like this. No, I was thinking, Bela, you would be the top boss. Krako, you'd be his lieutenant. The rest of you, I don't want any trouble from the rest of you because you'll have to answer to the Federation. We'll be back every year to collect our cut."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Tepo,,"Look, you figure maybe forty percent's enough?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,"Yeah, I think forty percent's sufficient."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Oxmyx,,It's reasonable. It sounds reasonable. That sound reasonable to you?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,,Chorus of approval.,
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,oxmyx's office,Kirk,,"It's reasonable, Mister Oxmyx. Let's break out some of your drinking stuff and celebrate the syndicate."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,"Gentlemen, you two have been brooding ever since we returned to the ship."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Spock,,"Brooding, Captain?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,"Brooding, Mister Spock. A sombre, emotional state. Now, do you wish to continue it or are you going to discuss it?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, I'm neither brooding nor sombre. But I do have reservations about your solution to the problem of the Iotians."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,"Ah, yes. I understand that. You don't think it's logical to leave a criminal organisation in charge."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Spock,,"Highly irregular, to say the least, Captain. I'm also curious as to how you propose to explain to Starfleet Command that a starship will be sent each year to collect our cut."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, that's a very good question, Mister Spock. I propose our cut be put into the planetary treasury and used to guide the Iotians into a more ethical system. Despite themselves, they'll be forced to accept conventional responsibilities. Isn't that logical? All right, Bones, in the language of the planet, what's your beef?"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Mccoy,,"I don't know how serious this is, Jim, and I don't quite know how to tell you"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,Go ahead.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Mccoy,,But in all the confusion I
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,Tell me.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Mccoy,,I think I left it in Bela's office.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,You left it?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Mccoy,,Somewhere. I'm not certain.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,You're not certain of what?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Mccoy,,I left my communicator.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,In Bela's office?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Spock,,"Captain. If the Iotians, who are very bright and imitative people, should take that communicator apart"
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,"They will, they will. And they'll find out how the transtator works."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Spock,,The transtator is the basis for every important piece of equipment that we have.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,Everything.
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Mccoy,,You really think it's that serious?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,"Serious? Serious, Bones? It upsets the whole percentage."
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Mccoy,,How do you mean?
49,2,A Piece Of The Action,bridge,Kirk,,"Well, in a few years, the Iotians may demand a piece of our action."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,,"A landing party of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Yeoman Thompson and a security guard have just beamed down.",
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Spock,,"No life form readings, Captain. Continuing scan."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Well, somebody sent a distress call."

50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,"It was very kind of you to respond so quickly, captain. Now you will surrender your ship to me."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kirk,,"You have a very strange sense of humour, Mister"
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,,"The man presses a button on his belt, and Kirk, Spock and McCoy are immobilised. The woman does the same to the Yeoman and guard.",
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,"I am Rojan of Kelva. I am your commander from this moment on. Any efforts to resist us or to escape will be severely punished. Soon we, and you, will leave this galaxy forever. You humans must face the end of your existence as you have known it. You are all paralyzed by a selective field that neutralises nerve impulses to the voluntary muscles. We can control you at will. I will now release you."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kirk,,Stay there.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Thompson,,Captain.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kirk,,It's all right.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Spock,,Interesting. A neural field?
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,Yes. Radiating from a central projector.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kirk,,What do you want?
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,"Your ship, Captain Kirk. It will serve us well in the long voyage that is to come."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kirk,,Voyage? Where?
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,"To your neighbouring galaxy, which you call Andromeda."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kirk,,Andromeda? Why?
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,It is our home.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Spock,,What brings you here?
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,"Within ten millennia, high radiation levels in our galaxy will make life there impossible. So the Kelvan Empire sent forth ships to explore other galaxies, to search for one which our race could conquer and occupy."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kirk,,"Well, sorry. This galaxy is already occupied."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,"Captain, you think you are unconquerable and your ship impregnable, but while we've talked, the capture has already begun."

50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,"Captain, we will modify its engines, in order to produce velocities far beyond the reach of your science. The journey between galaxies will take less than three hundred of your years."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Narrator,,Spock Fascinating. Intergalactic travel requiring only three hundred years. That is a leap far beyond anything man has yet accomplished.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Thompson,,You made a voyage of three hundred years?
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kelinda,,Our ships were of multigeneration design. We were born in the intergalactic void. We shall die there during our return journey.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,And our mission will be completed by a commander who is my descendant.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kirk,,What happened to your ship?
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,There is an energy barrier at the rim of your galaxy.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kirk,,"Yes, I know. We've been there."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,We managed to break through it with great difficulty. Our ship was destroyed. We barely managed to escape in a lifecraft. And now we have the means to begin our journey back to Andromeda.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Spock,,Why use our vessel? Why not transmit a message to your galaxy?
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,No form of transmission can penetrate the barrier.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kirk,,"Rojan, there's no reason to do this by force. Let's take your problem to the Federation. Research expeditions have catalogued hundreds of uninhabited planets in this galaxy suitable for colonization."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,We do not colonize. We conquer. We rule. There's no other way for us.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Mccoy,,"In other words, the galaxy isn't big enough for both of us."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kirk,,The Federation has handled foreign invasions before.

50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Hanar,,"All is proceeding according to plan, Rojan."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,"Kelinda, take them to the holding area. We'll keep you and your party here, Captain. Your crew will undoubtedly wish to co-operate with us if they understand that you are hostages."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kelinda,,Move there.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Hanar,,Tomar has examined the ship. The modifications are underway.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,"Space again, Hanar. I do not think we could have kept our sanity living too long on this accursed planet."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Hanar,,It is an undisciplined environment. One cannot control it. Yet there are things of interest.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,"Yes, but disturbing. These shells in which we've encased ourselves, they have such heightened senses. To feel. To hear. To smell. How do humans manage to exist in these fragile cases?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Hanar,,"Since the ship was designed to sustain these forms, we have little choice."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,"At least we'll be away from all of this openness. This is too strange for us, Hanar. We are creatures of outer space, and soon we will be safe in the comforting closeness of walls."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,,Rock walls with metal bars across the 'door'.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Spock,,"Fascinating material. Similar to diburnium, but considerably more dense. I doubt even phaser fire could disturb its molecular structure."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,All right. We can't break out. There must be another way.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Thompson,,"Captain, what do they want from us. What kind of people are they?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,That's a very good question.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Mccoy,,They registered as human.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Spock,,"No, Doctor. More than that. They registered as perfect human life forms. I recall noting the readings were almost classic textbook responses. Most curious."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,"Spock, what are the odds in such absolute duplication of life forms in another galaxy?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Spock,,The chances are very much against it.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Guard,,"Captain. (Kalinda has appeared so they move away from the door) Captain. However perfect they are, there don't seem to be very many of them. Why..."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,They have the paralysis field. Rojan mentioned something about a central projector.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Mccoy,,"Yes. If we could put that out of operation, we might have a chance."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Spock,,"Gentlemen, I'm constrained to point out we do not even know what this projector looks like."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,Those devices on their belts might indicate the source of the force field.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Spock,,Possible. I would have to have one to examine.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Guard,,"You'll have one, sir, if I have to rip one of the Kelvans apart to get it for you."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,"You'll get your chance, but you'll do it under orders."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Guard,,"Yes, sir."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,"On Eminiar Seven, you were able to trick the guard by a Vulcan mind probe."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Spock,,"Yes, I recall, Captain. I led him to believe we had escaped."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,Do you think you can do it again?
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Spock,,I shall attempt it.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,,"Kelinda seems to be getting nervous as Spock makes his attempt, then he is suddenly thrown across the cell. They go to his aid, Kelinda enters and Kirk grabs her and knocks her out. He takes the belt device.",
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,Are you all right?
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Spock,,"Yes, I will be all right, Captain. We must hurry."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,,"But as they come running out of their cell, Rojan and Hanar immobilise them. Kelinda walks over and is given her device back.",
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,releasing Kirk) This cannot go unpunished. Hanar. That one. (the guard,"Take him aside. Kelinda, the female."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Thompson,,Captain?
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,"Go. As a leader, you realize the importance of discipline. I need you and these other specialists, but those two are unnecessary."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kirk,,I'm responsible. Let them go.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,"I think we're somewhat alike, Captain. Each of us cares less for his own safety than for the lives of his command. We feel pain when others suffer for our mistakes. Your punishment shall be to watch them die. Captain. Proceed, Hanar."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,,The guard and the yeoman are reduced to blocks of solid matter.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,"Bring them to me. This is the essence of what they were. The flesh and brain and what you call the personality, distilled down into these compact shapes. And once crushed (he demonstrates) this person is dead. However, that one can be restored. (throws it on the ground) Hanar?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,,The security guard reappears.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 4657.5. Work is proceeding on the Enterprise as my crew is forced to make the required changes in the ship for intergalactic travel. I can't forget the picture of Yeoman Thompson crushed to a handful of dust."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Mccoy,,"Spock, are you sure you're all right?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Spock,,"Yes, quite all right, Doctor."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Mccoy,,You didn't look very well when you broke that mind touch.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Spock,,"I did not break it, Doctor. I was thrown away by something I've never experienced before."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,What was it?
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Spock,,"A series of bizarre and exotic images bursting on my mind and consciousness. Colours, shapes, mathematical equations fused and blurred. I've been attempting to isolate them, but so far I've been able to recall clearly only one. Immense beings, a hundred limbs which resemble tentacles. Minds of such control and capacity that each limb is capable of performing a different function."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Mccoy,,Do you mean that's what the Kelvans really are?
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Spock,,Undoubtedly.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Mccoy,,"Well, if they look that way normally, why did they adapt themselves to our bodies?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,Perhaps practicality. They chose the Enterprise as the best vessel for the trip. Immense beings with a hundred tentacles would have difficulty with the turbolift. We've got to stop them. We outnumber them. Their only hold on us is the paralysis field.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Mccoy,,"Well, that's enough. One wrong move, and they jam all our neural circuits."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,"Jam. Spock, if you reverse the circuits on McCoy's neuro-analyser, can you set up a counter field to jam the paralysis projector?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Spock,,"I'm dubious of the possibilities of success, Captain. The medical equipment is not designed to put out a great deal of power. The polarized elements would burn out quickly."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,Is there a chance at all?
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Spock,,A small one.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,We'll take it. You and Bones have to get to the ship.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Mccoy,,How?
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,"Yes. Mister Spock, you're sick."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Spock,,"I assure you, Captain, I am in perfect health."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,"No, you're not. Doctor McCoy has given you an thorough examination, and you're ill. In fact, if you don't get to the sickbay, you're going to die."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Mccoy,,"It's a good idea, Jim, but anyone looking at him can tell he's healthy."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,"Vulcans have the ability to place themselves in a kind of trance, complete relaxation of every part of the mind and body."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Spock,,We find it more restful to the body than your so-called vacation.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,"Can you do it now and come out of it in the sickbay, say in half an hour?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Spock,,It will take me a moment to prepare.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,Go ahead.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,,"Spock touches his forehead, straightens up, then falls gently into McCoy and Kirk's arms.",
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Mccoy,,"Jim, his heartbeat really is slow. His pulse is practically non-existent."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,goes to the door,Hanar? Hanar.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Hanar,,"What do you want, human?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,Mister Spock is ill. The doctor thinks he may be dying.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Hanar,,This illness came on him rather suddenly. Is it not unusual?
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,He's a Vulcan. They don't react like humans.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Mccoy,,"He may die. If I can get him up to sickbay, there's a chance he'll live."
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Hanar,,Stand away from the door. (enters the cell for a closer look) I will have you beamed aboard.
50,2,By Any Other Name,cell,Kirk,,"Do what you can with him, Bones."
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,,McCoy and Tomar wheel Spock in on a trolley.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,Chapel,,"Doctor, what happened?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,Mccoy,,Prepare two ccs of stokaline.
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,Chapel,,"Stokaline? But, doctor, that's"
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Don't argue, nurse. Just get it. (injects Spock) This may be the turning point. Prepare another shot."
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,Chapel,,"But, Doctor"
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Please, nurse, just follow orders, will you?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,,Spock opens his eyes then shuts them again before she returns with the hypo. McCoy gives another injection as Tomar watches from a little distance.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,Mccoy,,"There, that should do it. Just let him rest now. (to Tomar) You see, it's a flare-up of Rigelian Kassaba Fever. He suffered from it about ten years ago, and it recurs every now and then. There's no danger if he gets medication in time. He'll be all right in a couple of hours."
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,Tomar,,Very well. I will inform Rojan. You will stay here.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kirk,,What do you want from me now?
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,We will beam aboard the vessel shortly. I wish you to understand your duties.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kirk,,My duty is to stop you in any way I can.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,You will obey.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kirk,,Or you will kill more of my people?
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Rojan,,"Captain Kirk, I cannot believe that you do not understand the importance of my mission. We Kelvans have a code of honour. Harsh, demanding. It calls for much from us and much from those whom we conquer. You have been conquered. I respect your devotion to your duty, but I cannot permit it to interfere with mine."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kelinda,picking a flower and smelling it,"These are lovely. Captain Kirk, what is it you call them?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kirk,,Flowers. I don't know the variety.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kelinda,,"Our memory tapes tell us of such things on Kelvan. Crystals that form with such rapidity, they seem to grow. They look like this fragile thing somewhat. We call them Sahsheer."
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kirk,,A rose by any other name.
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kelinda,,Captain?
50,2,By Any Other Name,planet surface,Kirk,,"A quote from a great human poet, Shakespeare. That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,"Drea has computed and laid a course for Kelva, Captain."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Chekov,,We've jumped to warp eight.
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,And we'll go faster yet. Increase speed to warp eleven.
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Kirk,,"Increase speed to warp eleven, Mister Chekov."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Drea,,On course and proceeding as planned. We will approach the barrier within an hour.
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,Very well.
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Kirk,,"Rojan, I'm going to sickbay. My first officer was taken ill."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,"Yes, I was informed. You may go."
50,2,By Any Other Name,medical laboratory,Kirk,,Anything?
50,2,By Any Other Name,medical laboratory,Spock,,"I've located their power source, captain. It's installed in Engineering."
50,2,By Any Other Name,medical laboratory,Mccoy,,We're just going to jam it.
50,2,By Any Other Name,medical laboratory,Scott,,I've tied in all the lab computers. That will give it a bit more power to push with.
50,2,By Any Other Name,engineering,,"Scott and Spock are in the upper gallery, while Kirk is apparently talking to Tomar below in main engineering. There is a rounded metal object on the console.",
50,2,By Any Other Name,engineering,Scott,,This is it. Now all we have to do
50,2,By Any Other Name,engineering,Spock,,"Whatever it is we must do, it is impossible."
50,2,By Any Other Name,engineering,Scott,,Why?
50,2,By Any Other Name,engineering,Spock,,This material surrounding the projector is the same as I discovered on the planet. Readings indicate it is impervious to any of our weapons. We cannot penetrate the casing to get to the machine.
50,2,By Any Other Name,engineering,Scott,,"That's it, then."
50,2,By Any Other Name,engineering,Spock,,"There is one other possibility, Mister Scott. The final decision, of course, must be the captain's, but I believe we must have it ready for him. The Enterprise is propelled by matter-anti-matter reactors. The barrier we must traverse is negative energy."
50,2,By Any Other Name,engineering,Scott,,I see what you're getting at. I can't say I like it.
50,2,By Any Other Name,engineering,Spock,,Nor I. But it must be made available to the captain.
50,2,By Any Other Name,corridor,,Spock and Scott meet up with Kirk.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,corridor,Drea,,"Captain Kirk to the bridge, please."
50,2,By Any Other Name,turbolift,Kirk,,Well?
50,2,By Any Other Name,turbolift,Spock,,"Impossible, Captain. The power source is protected by a material we cannot breach even with our phasers. Mister Scott and I have prepared the means for the only logical alternative available to us."
50,2,By Any Other Name,turbolift,Kirk,,What alternative?
50,2,By Any Other Name,turbolift,Spock,,The barrier we must penetrate is composed of negative energy.
50,2,By Any Other Name,turbolift,Scott,,"I have opened the control valves to the matter-anti-matter nacelles. On your signal, I will flood them with positive energy."
50,2,By Any Other Name,turbolift,Kirk,,What?
50,2,By Any Other Name,turbolift,Spock,,"When we engage the barrier, the ship will explode. The Kelvans will be stopped here."
50,2,By Any Other Name,turbolift,Scott,,And so will we.
50,2,By Any Other Name,turbolift,Kirk,,Are you mad? I can't just
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,,The turbolift arrives.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,"Take your places, gentlemen. We're approaching the barrier."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,,"Kirk takes the Captain's chair, Spock and Scott their consoles. As the barrier approaches, Scott's finger is poised over a flashing button.",
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 4658.9. With The Enterprise under control of the Kelvans, we are approaching the energy barrier at the edge of our galaxy. Spock and Scotty have devised a suicide plan to stop the Kelvans. They have rigged the ship to explode on my signal."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Kirk,,"Reading, Spock."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Spock,,"Sensors indicate density negative, radiation negative, energy negative. (Kirk starts chewing his nails with indecision) All instruments off the dials, Captain. We are in contact with the barrier."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Scott,,"Outside hull temperatures rising, sir. It's over two thousand degrees now. Sir?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Kirk,,Hold your position.
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,,Scott throws switches to stop the button flashing. The ship starts shaking as it passes through the barrier into intergalactic space.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Chekov,,We made it.
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Spock,,"Instruments returning to normal, Captain."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Uhura,,All decks report. Damage and casualties.
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Scott,,"Several systems out, sir. Operating on emergency backup. None affect flight procedure."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Spock,,Life support systems sustaining on emergency.
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Uhura,,"I'll have a full report on ship's status for you in a moment, sir."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,"Your people are most efficient, Captain."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Kirk,,Thank you. So are yours.
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,"Hanar, start the neutralising operation."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,,Hanar leaves.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Kirk,,What neutralising operation?
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,"You humans are troublesome for us. We needed you to get us through the barrier. But there aren't enough of us to efficiently guard all of you of the time. Further, the food synthesisers cannot manufacture enough food for the entire journey. We are therefore neutralising all nonessential personnel."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Kirk,,No!
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,"The procedure is already underway. Now, as to bridge personnel. Drea? We have no need for communication."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,,Uhura is reduced to a block of salts.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,And since Drea is capable of handling the ship from here on.
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,,"Bye, Chekov and other crew.",
50,2,By Any Other Name,corridor,,Kirk is walking along when he comes across a cluster of blocks and some instruments on the floor.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,corridor,Rojan,,"Do you not agree that this is better thing for them than exploding the ship as your engineer had thought to do? We detected it, of course. Tomar has devised a mechanism to prevent any further tampering. Please accept your situation, Captain. It will make things much less painful."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,Is this all?
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,"I have reviewed ship's personnel, Captain. It appears we four are the only ones the Kelvans consider essential."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Mccoy,,Scotty tells me you could've destroyed the ship in the barrier. Why didn't you?
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,I couldn't.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Mccoy,,But that was our only chance to stop them
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,I didn't think it was.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Mccoy,,Jim
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,"Bones, that's enough!"
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Mccoy,,"Jim, I saw them reduce four of my doctors and nurses into those little"
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,They've reduced the whole crew! (thumps table in anger)
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Tomar,,I do not understand why you take the trouble to consume this bulk material to sustain yourselves. (holds up a pill box) We have ascertained that these contain all the nutritional elements.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Mccoy,,"Before you condemn it, why not try it?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Tomar,,I believe I will. Assist me.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,"It's your idea, Doctor. Go ahead."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Mccoy,,"All right, I'll show you how to work the selector."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,,He gets a tray of food for Tomar and sits him down at another table. Tomar takes a cautious mouthful.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Scott,whispering,"Sir, why don't we try again to knock out the paralysis projector? I know the casing looks impenetrable, but I may be able to do something."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,"Even if we could, it's out of the question. We need that projector to bring our people back to human form."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Scott,,Then how will we stop the Kelvans?
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,Captain?
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,,"They look over at Tomar, who is enjoying his meal.",
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Tomar,,It's quite good.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Mccoy,,I'm delighted.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,Most curious.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,What is?
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,"The isolated glimpses of things I saw when I touched Kelinda's mind are beginning to coalesce in my consciousness. The Kelvans have superior intellectual capacity. To achieve it, they have apparently sacrificed anything which would tend to distract them. Perceptive senses such as taste, touch, smell, and, of course, emotions."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,But then Tomar shouldn't be enjoying the taste of his food.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,"Yes. Quite correct, Captain. But they have taken human form and are therefore having human reaction."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Mccoy,,"If he keeps reacting like that, he's going to need a diet."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,"If they all respond to stimulation of the senses, then maybe we can distract them. They can't have been able to handle the senses yet. If we can confuse them enough, we can get those devices from their belts."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,That seems reasonable.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,All right. It may be our only chance. Look for any way to stimulate the senses.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Scott,,"I can think of one way right off. (goes over to Tomar) Lad, you're going to need something to wash that down with. Have you ever tried any Saurian brandy?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,,McCoy is examining Hanar.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,Mccoy,,I don't know about that.
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,Hanar,,Please articulate.
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well, that body of yours is a bit anaemic. Comes from taking food in pills instead of solid sustenance."
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,Hanar,,What are you doing?
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I'm going to give you a shot. High-potency vitamin concentrate. You'll need three a day for a few days. And eat some solid food, will you?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,,"The brandy bottle is empty, and the two men are full of alcohol.",
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,Tomar,,No more.
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,,"Kelinda is at a desk, apparently working.",
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kirk,,Am I disturbing you?
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kelinda,,What is it you wish?
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kirk,,I wish to apologise.
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kelinda,,"I don't understand, Captain."
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kirk,,For hitting you. I'm sorry.
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kelinda,,That is not necessary. You attempted to escape as we would have.
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kirk,,"Yes, well, I don't usually go around beating up beautiful women."
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kelinda,,Why not?
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kirk,,"Well, there are better things for men and women to do."
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kelinda,,Like what?
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,,He strokes her collar bone.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kirk,,Is this where I hit you?
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kelinda,,"No, the other side."
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kirk,,Oh. I'm sorry. (he kisses it) Is that better?
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kelinda,,Better? Was it intended as a remedy?
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kirk,,This is.
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,,And gives her a full-on kiss with embrace.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kelinda,,Is there some significance to this action?
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kirk,,"Well, among humans, it's meant to express warmth and love."
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kelinda,,Oh. You are trying to seduce me. I have been studying you.
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kirk,,Me?
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kelinda,,All humans. This business of love. You have devoted much literature to it. Why do you build such a mystique around a simple biological function?
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kirk,,We enjoy it.
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kelinda,,The literature?
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kirk,,"Kelinda, I'm sorry I brought up the whole subject."
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kelinda,,Do you really regard this touching of the lips as pleasurable?
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kirk,,I did.
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kelinda,,Curious. Let me try.
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,,"She kisses him, and Rojan enters.",
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Rojan,,"Is there some problem, Captain?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kirk,,Not when I came in.
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,,Kirk leaves,
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Rojan,,What did he want here?
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kelinda,,He came to apologise for hitting me. Apparently it involves some peculiar touching contact.
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Rojan,,"In what manner? (she kisses him) Very odd creatures, these humans."
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,,Another bottle has been emptied.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,Tomar,,Do you have more?
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,Scott,,Not of this.
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,Tomar,,Anything.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,,Spock and Rojan are playing 3D chess.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,"Yes. Humans are very peculiar. I often find them unfathomable, but an interesting psychological study."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,"Well, I do not understand this business of pressing with the lips to apologise."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,I believe you're referring to a kiss. But it is my understanding that such apologies are usually exchanged between people who have some affection for each other.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,Kelinda has no affection for Captain Kirk.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,Your game is off. Are you disturbed by the incident?
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,Why should I be disturbed?
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,"You've known Kelinda for some time. She's a Kelvan as you are. Among humans, I've found the symptoms you're displaying usually indicate jealousy."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,"I have no reason for such a reaction. Kelinda's a female, nothing more."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,Captain Kirk seems to find her quite attractive.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,"Well, of course she is!"
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,You are not jealous?
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,No!
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,Nor upset?
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,Certainly not.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,Checkmate.
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,Scott,,"I found this on Ganymood, er, Ganymede."
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,Tomar,,What is it?
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,Scott,,"Well, it's, er. (peers at it, sniffs it) It's green."
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,,Kelinda is preening herself in front of a mirror when Rojan walks in.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Rojan,,"Kelinda, I've been thinking."
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kelinda,,Yes?
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Rojan,,I do not wish you to fraternise with any of the humans.
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kelinda,,Why not?
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Rojan,,"Well, they, they offer such strange ideas. They're not meant for us. Not for Kelvans."
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kelinda,,Have you given this order to the others?
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Rojan,,No. And I wish you to particularly avoid Captain Kirk.
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Kelinda,,"I will not. You have told me over and over again, humans are no threat to us. We are superior. I will do as I please."
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,Rojan,,"You will do as I say, or I will neutralise your Captain Kirk and all the other humans as well."
50,2,By Any Other Name,kelinda's quarters,,He has taken a rather firm hold of her arm.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,,Hanar is having another vitamin shot.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,Hanar,,How many more of these?
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well, now, let's see. You've had three shots. I think you better stay on them for a few days, and then we'll see how you're responding."
50,2,By Any Other Name,sickbay,Hanar,,I see no reason for you to refer to yourself in the plural.
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,Tomar,,You have more?
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,Scott,,"All I have is a bottle of very, very, very old Scotch. Whisky!"
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,Tomar,,I will try it.
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,Scott,,"I'll get it! (takes the helmet off a breastplate and reaches in, removing a very dusty bottle.) I was saving you for"
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,Tomar,,What?
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,Scott,,Never mind. Gie us your glass.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,"The thing is, I can't tell if we're getting anywhere. And I haven't seen Scotty in hours."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Mccoy,,We haven't seen Tomar either. But my man Hanar is getting more irritable by the minute. I'm giving him shots of formazine. That should have him climbing the walls.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,Rojan has exhibited symptoms of jealousy.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,,Kelinda enters.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kelinda,,"I would like to speak with you, Captain."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,"Doctor, I'm due for another injection of stokaline."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Mccoy,,Hmm?
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,Stokaline.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Mccoy,,Oh. You will pardon us.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,,Spock and McCoy leave.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,You had something to say?
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kelinda,,Yes. This cultural mystique surrounding the biological function.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,Yes?
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kelinda,,You realise humans are overly preoccupied with the subject.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,Yes. We do think a great deal about it.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kelinda,,"I've done some supplemental reading on it, and, er"
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,You have a question?
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kelinda,,"Yes. I was wondering, would you please apologise to me again?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,,Kirk smiles broadly.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Hanar,,"Rojan, I want to talk to you."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,Very well.
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Hanar,,"First, I do not like the way responsibility and duty has been portioned out to us."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,It's the way your duties have always been assigned.
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Hanar,,That is my second quarrel with you.
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,Hanar!
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Hanar,,"And further, I do not care much for the way you run this ship."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,"Hanar, confine yourself to your quarters!"
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,,"Hanar storms off the bridge, and Rojan hits the arm of the Captain's chair. Drea stares.",
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,,There's a whole lot of smooching going on.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kelinda,coming up for air,Rojan has forbidden me to see you.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,"Yes, that's too bad. Why do you defy him?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kelinda,,It's not a question of defiance. We were told to find out everything we could about you.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,Huh. And how's the research going?
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kelinda,,I need some more experiments.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,,She's getting the hang of kissing.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,"Mister Spock, you were not ordered to the bridge. What is your purpose here?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Spock,,Automatic sensors and various other recording devices require monitoring and periodic adjustments.
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,Very well. Proceed. Have you seen Captain Kirk?
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Spock,,"If you wish, I shall call him to the bridge."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,No. I was wondering where he was.
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Spock,,I left him in the recreation room.
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,He was alone then.
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Spock,,"No, Kelinda was with him. She seemed anxious to speak to him."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Rojan,,I told her to stay away from him.
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,Spock,,"It would appear, sir, that you have little control over her. Or perhaps Captain Kirk has more."
50,2,By Any Other Name,bridge,,Rojan leaves the bridge.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,,The last drops of Scotch go into Tomar's glass.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,Tomar,,Very interesting. But I feel rather strange.
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,,He makes some jerking motions then falls off his chair onto the floor.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,Scott,,"We did it, you and me. Put him right under the table. (takes the paralyser off Tomar's belt) I'll take this to the captain."
50,2,By Any Other Name,scott's quarters,,"He gets to the door, then stops and gently falls back against the wall. He slides to the floor, as out of it as Tomar is.",
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,,Rojan breaks up the kissing session.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,"Kelinda, I told you to avoid this human."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kelinda,,I did not wish to.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,I am your commander.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,"That's not enough, Rojan."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,"You did this to her, corrupted her, turned her away from me!"
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,"If you can't keep her, that's not my problem."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,You will release her!
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,,"Rojan drags Kirk away from Kalinda. Kirk slaps him across the face, twice. Finally he has goaded him into a fight.",
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,Why don't you use your paralyser? You thought I was taking your woman away from you. You're jealous! You tried to kill me with your bare hands. Would a Kelvan do that? Would he have to? You're reacting with the emotions of a human. You are a human.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,"No, I cannot be!"
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,,"He throws off Kirk, into the arms of Spock and McCoy who are entering the room.",
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,"I'm stimulating him. (McCoy pushes him back into the fight.) You have no choice. To use this ship, you have to use our form and now you're stuck with it, you and your descendants, for the next three hundred years."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,You fool. These bodies are tools. We remain Kelvans!
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,"Look what's happened in the short time you've been exposed to us. What do you think will happen in three centuries? When this ship gets to Kelva, the people on it will be human. They'll be aliens. Enemies!"
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,"We have a duty, our mission. We've got to accomplish any way we can."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,Your mission is to find new worlds for your people to live in. You can still do that. We can bring this problem to the Federation. There are many planets in this galaxy that can be inhabited.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,You would really do that? You would extend welcome to invaders?
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,,They finally stop fighting.,
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,No. But we would welcome friends.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,"Rojan, you are only a link in a chain, following an order given three hundred years ago. This is an opportunity for you to establish a destiny of your own."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,Perhaps. Perhaps it could be done.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Spock,,A robot ship could be sent to Kelva with the Federation proposal.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,"But if we retain this form, where could we find a place?"
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Mccoy,,Seems to me that little planet you were on is kind of nice.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,And you. You would wish to remain with him?
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kelinda,,"He's most interesting, but I wish to go with you. I believe I owe you an apology. (she kisses Rojan) It's most pleasurable."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,Yes. Very curious.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Kirk,,"You see, Rojan, being human does have certain advantages. Being able to appreciate the beauty of a flower or a woman."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,"Bridge, this is Rojan."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Drea,,"Yes, Commander."
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Rojan,,I'm returning command of the ship to Captain Kirk. You will follow his orders.
50,2,By Any Other Name,rec room,Drea,,Sir?

51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Uhura,,"It's not a signal, sir. It does not seem to even exist, and yet it's affecting all my channels."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Kirk,,Well?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Spock,,Someone or something is attempting to attract our attention.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Kirk,,"Someone or something has succeeded. Our distress signal relays have been activated. We've been given a direction to follow, but how? What's causing it?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Spock,,"I do not know. Not even a Vulcan can know the unknown, Captain. We are hundreds of light years past where any Earth ship has ever explored."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Sulu,,"Planet dead ahead, Captain. Becoming visual."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,,There's a yellow and gold planet on the viewscreen.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Spock,,"Class M planet, Captain."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Kirk,,Close to Earth conditions.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Spock,,"With two very important exceptions. It's much older than Earth, and about a half million years ago, its atmosphere was totally ripped away by some sort of cataclysm. The planet has evidently been dead since then. Sensors detect no life of any kind."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Sargon,,"All of your questions will be answered in time, Captain Kirk."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Narrator,,KIRK; Are your hailing frequencies open?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Uhura,,"No, sir."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Sargon,,I am Sargon. It is the energy of my thoughts which has touched your instruments and directed you here. Now with this closer distance I can speak to you at last.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Kirk,,"Who are you, Sargon?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Sargon,,"Please assume a standard orbit about our planet, Captain."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Kirk,,Is that a request or demand?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Sargon,,The choice is yours. I read what is in your mind. Words are unnecessary.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Kirk,,The planet is dead. There's no possibility of life there as we understand life.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Sargon,,"And I am as dead as my planet. Does that frighten you, James Kirk? For if it does, if you let what is left of me perish, then all of you, my children, all of mankind must perish, too."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's Log. Stardate 4768.3. The Enterprise is in orbit above a planet whose surface, our sensors tell us, is devoid of all life, a world destroyed and dead for at least a half million years. Yet from it comes a voice, the energy of pure thought, telling us something has survived here for those thousands of centuries."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Kirk,dictating log,"Since exploration and contact with alien intelligences is our primary mission, I've decided to risk the potential dangers and resume contact. Log entry out. How long before Starfleet receives that?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Uhura,,"Over three weeks at this distance, sir."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Spock,,Captain.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Kirk,,Got something?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Spock,,Sensors registering some form of energy deep inside the planet.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Sargon,,"Your probes have touched me, Mister Spock."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Spock,,"Reading energy only, Captain. No life forms."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Sargon,,I have locked your transporter device on my co-ordinates. Please come to us. Rescue us from oblivion.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Spock,,"Coming from deep under the planet's surface, Captain. Under at least one hundred miles of solid rock."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Sargon,,I will make it possible for your transporter to beam you that deep beneath the surface. Have no fear.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Spock,,"Reading a chamber now. Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, suitable for human life support."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant Uhura, have Doctor McCoy report to the transporter room in ten minutes with standard landing party equipment."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Kirk,,Spock.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, I do wish to inspect whatever this is that lived that long ago."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Kirk,,"And I would like to have my science officer with me on something as unusual as this, but it is full of unknowns and we can't risk both of us being off the ship."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,,The lights go out.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Sulu,,"All power gone, sir."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Kirk,,"On the other hand, perhaps this Sargon would like you to come with us."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,,Power is restored.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Spock,,Fascinating.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Sulu,,All normal. No damage at all.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Kirk,,"I see. Will you transport down with us, Mister Spock?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Spock,,"Evidently, Captain."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Sulu, you have the conn."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Mccoy,,"Jim, why no briefing on this? I'd at least like to know what we're getting into."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Kirk,,"Easy, Bones. As long as you know there's something down there, you know as much as we do. The rest is only guesses."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Scott,,"I don't like it, sir. The transporter co-ordinates preset by an alien of some sort. You could materialise inside solid rock."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Mccoy,,Inside solid rock?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Spock,,Unlikely. These co-ordinates correspond with the location of the subterranean chamber.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Kirk,,I have a feeling that they or it could destroy us just standing here if they or it wanted to.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Mulhall,,They or it?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Kirk,,Who are you?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Mulhall,,"Doctor Ann Mulhall, Astro-biology. Well, I was ordered to report here for landing party duty."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Kirk,,By whom?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Mulhall,,"Strange, I'm not sure. Well, I'm not a liar, Captain. I did receive an order to report here for duty."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Spock,,"I'm sure she did, Captain, Just as you received an order to bring me along."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Kirk,,"Oh, yes."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Mccoy,,Let's get back to this solid rock business. Just how much rock are we going to go through?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Spock,,"Approximately one hundred twelve point three seven miles, Doctor."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Mccoy,,Miles? Are you joking?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Kirk,,"No, we're not. Let's go."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Sargon,,Please stand ready. I will operate your controls.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Kirk,,"Doctor, if you prefer to stay behind?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Mccoy,,"No. No, if I'd be useful, as long as you're going down, I might as well take a medical look at whatever this is."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,,"The landing party and two guards gather on the pads, Scotty stands sulking with arms crossed as the transporter activates, and just sends the four officers somewhere.",
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Spock,,"Captain, the security guards."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,Kirk here.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Scott,,"Can you read me, Captain?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,"Yes, Scotty, and I shouldn't be able to this deep inside the planet, but perhaps this has been arranged for us, too. Is the security guard up there?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,transporter room,Scott,,They're fine. They Just didn't dematerialise.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Scott,,"I don't like it, sir."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,No problem yet. Maintain alert. Kirk out.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Mulhall,,"Atmosphere report, Captain. A fraction richer in oxygen than usual for us, but otherwise normal."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Spock,,"This vault was constructed about a half a million years ago. About the same time the planet surface was destroyed, if our sensor readings are accurate."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,Composition of walls?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Spock,,They're an alloy or substance completely unknown to me. Much stronger and harder than anything I've measured before.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Mulhall,,"All readings are off the scale, Captain."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Mccoy,,The air seems fresh. It must be re-circulated somehow.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,"Is that for us, or does it need fresh air?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,,"A panel slides back to reveal a much larger area, with rock walls, and a glowing sphere elegantly poised on an angled support.",
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Sargon,the glowing sphere,Welcome. I am Sargon.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Spock,,"Sargon, would it harm you if I"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Sargon,,"You may use your tricorder, Mister Spock. Your readings will show energy but no substance. Sealed in this receptacle is the essence of my mind."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Spock,,Pure energy. Matter without form.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,Impossible.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Mccoy,,But you once had a body of some type?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Sargon,,"A body much as yours, my children, although our minds were infinitely greater."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,That's twice you've referred to us as my children.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Sargon,,"Because it is possible you are our descendants, Captain Kirk. Six thousand centuries ago, our vessels were colonising this galaxy, just as your own starships have now begun to explore that vastness. As you now leave your own seed on distant planets, so we left our seed behind us. Perhaps your own legends of an Adam and an Eve were two of our travellers."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Mulhall,,"Our beliefs and our studies indicate that life on our planet, Earth, evolved independently."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Spock,,"That would tend, however, to explain certain elements of Vulcan prehistory."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Sargon,,"In either case, I do not know. It was so long ago, and the records of our travels were lost in the cataclysm which we loosened upon ourselves."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,A war?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Sargon,,A struggle for such goals and the unleashing of such power that you could not comprehend.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,"Then perhaps your intelligence wasn't so great, Sargon. We faced a similar crisis in our early nuclear age. We found the wisdom not to destroy ourselves."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Sargon,,"And we survived our primitive nuclear era, my son. But there comes to all races an ultimate crisis which you have yet to face."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,I don't understand.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Sargon,,"One day our minds became so powerful, we dared think of ourselves as gods."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,You said you wanted our help. What is it you wish?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,,"Kirk staggers back slightly, then there is a high-pitched sound as his head is flung back.",
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Spock,,"Just a moment, Doctor."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,I am Sargon.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Mccoy,,Where's our captain? Where's Jim Kirk?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,He is unharmed. I have taken his body to demonstrate
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Mccoy,drawing his phaser,"I won't go along with this. Back to where you were, Sargon, or whatever you are."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Spock,,"And if he refuses, Doctor, what do you propose to do with your phaser? That is still Jim's body."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,,"Kirk convulses briefly, and the sphere has dimmed a lot.",
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,"Lungs filled with air again. To see again. Heart pumping, arteries surging with blood again. A half a million years. To be again. Your captain has an excellent body, Doctor McCoy. I compliment you both on the condition in which you maintained it."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Spock,,What are your plans for it? Can you exchange places again when you wish?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,"Have no fear. Your captain is quite unharmed, although his mind generates insufficient energy for him to speak from there as I do."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Spock,,Doctor?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Mulhall,,"Yes, I have the same readings."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Mccoy,,"Are you aware of what's happening to his body? Heart action doubled, temperature a hundred and four degrees?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Mulhall,,He'll die if you don't leave his body. Soon!
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Spock,,What is it you want of us?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,"In the next room, there are other receptacles. The other two of us that survived. You, Doctor Ann Mulhall, and you, Mister Spock, we require your bodies also. We must have Captain Kirk and you so that we may live again."

51,2,Return To Tomorrow,small chamber,Kirk,,"Even for us, a half million years is almost too long to wait. Two others still survive. Henoch and Thalassa. Thalassa, my Thalassa. I am pleased you survived with me. Forgive me. It has been so very long."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,small chamber,Spock,,When the struggle came which devastated your planet
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,small chamber,Kirk,,"Only the best minds were chosen to survive. Thalassa, my wife, as you may have guessed. Henoch, from the other side. Realising our mistake, we attempted to perpetuate both sides. We built this chamber here in order to preserve our essence in this fashion."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,small chamber,Spock,,Fascinating.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,small chamber,Kirk,,"We knew the seed that we had planted on other planets would take root, that one day you would build vessels as we did, and one day you would come here."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,small chamber,Spock,,"These others, they were stored differently than you, but it was your task to remain in the receptacle out there KIRK: and search the heavens with my mind, probing, waiting, probing. And then one day my mind touched your vessel and brought you here."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,small chamber,Mulhall,,So you could steal our bodies from us?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,small chamber,Kirk,,"To steal? To take them from you? No, no, my children, you misunderstand. We mean only that you should lend us your bodies for a short time."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,small chamber,Mccoy,,"And destroy them, just as you're burning that one up now. Heartbeat's two hundred and sixty two, Spock. Entire metabolic rate correspondingly high."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,small chamber,Kirk,,I will return your captain to you before the body limit has been reached.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,small chamber,Spock,,"Our bodies, Sargon, for what purpose?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,small chamber,Kirk,,"To build. To build humanoid robots. We must borrow your bodies long enough to have the use of your hands, your fingers."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,small chamber,Spock,,"Then you intend to construct mechanical bodies, move your minds into them, and then return our bodies to us."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,small chamber,Mulhall,,"We have engineers, technicians. Why can't they build your robots for you?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,small chamber,Kirk,,"No. Our methods, our skills are far beyond your abilities. It is time."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,small chamber,,They help him back to Sargon's sphere.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,,"Kirk briefly convulses with pain, then the sphere glows bright again, and he falls to his knees.",
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Mccoy,,"Is it you, Jim? (a nod) Good, his metabolic rate is back to normal."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Spock,,"Captain, do you know what happened? Do you remember any part of it?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,Yes. Sargon borrowed my body. I was floating in time and space.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Mccoy,,"He doesn't appear to be harmed. Physically, anyway."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,"Spock, I remember. When Sargon and I exchanged, as we passed each other, for an instant we were one. I know him now. I know what he is and what he wants, and I don't fear him."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Mccoy,,That's the most ridiculous statement I've ever heard. An alien practically hijacks your body and then corks you into a bottle and
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Mulhall,,I'm afraid that I must agree with Doctor McCoy. You could be suffering from a form of false euphoria.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Kirk,,Sargon.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Sargon,,"I understand, my son. Go to your vessel. All who are involved must agree to this. After all these centuries, we can wait a few more hours."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Mccoy,,And what if we should decide against you?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,chamber,Sargon,,Then you may go as freely as you came.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Scott,,"You're going to what? Are they all right in the head, Doctor?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Mccoy,,No comment.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Kirk,,A simple transference. Their minds and ours.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Mccoy,,Quite simple. Happens every day.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Kirk,,"Scotty, I need your approval, too. Since you'll work with them, furnishing them all they need to make the android robots."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Narrator,,"You won't be working with them, you'll be working with us, our bodies. They'll be inside us, and we'll be"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Mccoy,,It all seems rather indecent to me.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Mulhall,,"I'm not so certain of that, Doctor. It is scientifically fascinating."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Spock,,"Once inside their mechanical bodies, engineer, they can leave this planet, travel back with us. With their knowledge, mankind could leap ahead ten thousand years."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Kirk,,"Bones, they'll show us medical advances, miracles you never dreamed possible. Scotty, engineering advances. Vessels this size with engines the size of walnuts."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Scott,,Ach! You're joking.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Spock,,"No, he's not."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Mccoy,,"They're giants, and we're insects beside them. They could destroy us without meaning to. And all he wants is the body of our captain and our second in command, too. Coincidence?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Kirk,,They selected us as the most compatible bodies.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Mccoy,,"What's your attitude on that, Doctor?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Mulhall,,"Well, if we all agree, I'm willing to host Thalassa's mind. I'm a scientist. The opportunity is an extraordinary one for experimentation, observation."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Scott,,A starship engine the size of a walnut? That's impossible. But I don't suppose there'd be any harm in looking over diagrams on it.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Kirk,,Bones? You could stop all this by saying no. That's why I called you all here together. We'll all be deeply involved. It must be unanimous.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Then I'll still want one question answered to my satisfaction. Why? Not a list of possible miracles, but a simple basic understandable why that overrides all danger. And let's not kid ourselves that there is no potential danger in this."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Kirk,,"They used to say if man could fly, he'd have wings. But he did fly. He discovered he had to. Do you wish that the first Apollo mission hadn't reached the moon, or that we hadn't gone on to Mars and then to the nearest star? That's like saying you wish that you still operated with scalpels and sewed your patients up with catgut like your great-great-great-great-grandfather used to. I'm in command. I could order this. But I'm not because, Doctor McCoy is right in pointing out the enormous danger potential in any contact with life and intelligence as fantastically advanced as this. But I must point out that the possibilities, the potential for knowledge and advancement is equally great. Risk. Risk is our business. That's what the starship is all about. That's why we're aboard her. You may dissent without prejudice. Do I hear a negative vote? (silence around the table) Engineer, stand by to beam aboard three receptacles."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,,"The three volunteers are lying on beds, with the spheres on tables beside them.",
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,"The extreme power of the alien mind will drive the heart action dangerously high, and The body functions will race many times their normal metabolism, so we're going to have to monitor this very carefully."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Chapel,,"Yes, sir."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well, I guess we're as ready as we'll ever be, Jim."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Kirk,,"Ready, Sargon."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,,"The spheres emit a brilliant light, the patients twitch, then the spheres dim.",
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Kirk,with echoy Sargon voice,The transference is complete.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Chapel,,"Metabolic rate is double and rising, Doctor."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Spock,with a grin and echoy voice,"Hello. Oh, you are a lovely female. A pleasant sight to wake up to after half a million years."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Chapel,,Thank you.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Spock,,You're welcome.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mulhall,echoy,I'd forgotten what it felt like even to breathe again. Sargon?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Kirk,,Here. In this body.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mulhall,,"I am not displeased, my husband. Your body is not unlike that which was your own."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Kirk,,"And I too am pleased, beloved."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mulhall,,After so long. So very long.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Kirk,,Kiss.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,,So they do.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Spock,,"This is an excellent body, Doctor. I seem to have received the best of the three. Strength, hearing, eyesight, all far above your human norms. I'm surprised the Vulcans never conquered your race."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Vulcans worship peace above all, Henoch."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Spock,,"Yes, of course, Just as we do, Doctor."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,,Mulhall/Thalassa collapses and they help her back onto the bed.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,Nurse!
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,,Then Kirk/Sargon gets dizzy.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Chapel,,Doctor?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Henoch, you'd better get back to bed too."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Spock,,"It will be unnecessary, Doctor. This Vulcan body is accustomed to the higher metabolism."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Sargon, it won't work. You've got to get out before you kill them."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Kirk,,We will vacate at once until you can administer a metabolic reduction injection.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,A what?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Spock,,"I'll prepare the formula, Sargon."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Kirk,,"Henoch, your condition?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Spock,,I can continue in this body for several hours.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Kirk,,Fortunate. We will vacate at once.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,,And they are as good as their word.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Spock,,This woman will assist me. (to Chapel) You will take me to your pharmacology laboratory.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,,They leave.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Kirk,,"Bones, what?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,"It was close, Jim. You both barely got back alive. Unless the formula works, we can't risk it again."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,pharmacy,Spock,,"Now. this formula will reduce the heart action and the bodily functions to normal. While the bodies are occupied, you will administer one injection of ten cc's each hour."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,pharmacy,Chapel,,I understand.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,pharmacy,Spock,,This hypo you will code mark for Thalassa. And this one you will code mark for me.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,pharmacy,Chapel,,"Yes, sir."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,pharmacy,Spock,,This one you will administer to Captain Kirk while Sargon is in his body.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,pharmacy,Chapel,,This hypo does not contain the same formula.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,pharmacy,Spock,,"No, that's correct. But since I will arrange for you to administer each of the injections, no one else will notice."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,pharmacy,Chapel,,"Without the same formula, Captain Kirk will die."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,pharmacy,,He touches her forehead.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,pharmacy,Spock,,What were you saying?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,pharmacy,Chapel,,I. I was. I wanted to say something. I've forgotten what it was.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,pharmacy,Spock,,"Yes. Well, you were about to say that you watched me prepare the formula and fill each of the hypos."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,pharmacy,Chapel,,"Yes, that, that was it. I will inform Doctor McCoy that each is properly filled for each patient."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,pharmacy,Spock,,"Very good. You see, Sargon would not permit me to keep this body. It is therefore necessary for you to kill your captain so that Sargon will die with him."

51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,"As planned, the construction of android robots is underway. All is proceeding as expected and as promised. I can find no reason for concern, but yet I am filled with foreboding."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,,"Sargon and Thalassa are working, when their hands touch.",
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Mulhall,,"Sargon, I remember a day long ago. We sat beside a silver lake. The air was scented with the flowers of our planet."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Kirk,,I remember. You held my hand like this.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,,"He kisses it, as Spock comes in.",
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Kirk,,I think it best not to remember so well.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Spock,,"In two days, you'll have your own hands, Thalassa. Mechanically efficient and quite human-looking. Android robot hands, of course. Hands without feeling. Enjoy the taste of life while you can."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Kirk,,"Our minds will have survived. And as androids, we can move among the people who do live, teaching them, helping them not to make the errors we did."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Mulhall,,"What is it, Sargon?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Kirk,,Nothing. Our next injection will renovate me. Do not be concerned.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,,Chapel is holding the hypos and trying to remember something very important.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Nurse, how are the last metabolic readings on our patients?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Chapel,,"You'll find them excellent, Doctor. Well within normal."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Is something wrong, Miss Chapel?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Chapel,,"Er, yes. I, er, I had something to say. I can't seem to remember."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,Regarding our patients?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Chapel,,"Yes. That must be it. I am so pleased the way they are responding, Doctor. The formula's working perfectly."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,"You look tired, Miss Chapel. Perhaps you'd care for me to administer the last few injections."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Chapel,,"Tired? Well, not at all, Doctor. Thank you for asking."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,,Leaves a puzzled McCoy.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,,Mulhall/Thalassa is looking at her reflection in a metallic surface when Scott comes in with a small doo-dad.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Mulhall,,Thank you. Have you prepared the negaton hydracoils for the drawing Sargon supplied?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Scott,,"For all the good it'll do you. It's a fancy name, but how will something that looks like a drop of jelly make this thing work? You'll need microgears and a pulley that does what a muscle does."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Mulhall,,That would be highly inefficient.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Scott,,"I tell you, lady, this thing won't work."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Spock,,"It will have twice the strength and agility of your body, engineer, and will last a thousand years. That is, assuming you'll stop wasting your time and allow us to complete it."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,,Scott leaves as 'Spock' laughs.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Spock,,"A thousand-year prison, Thalassa. And when it wears out we'll build another one, and we'll lock ourselves into it for another thousand years. And another, and another. Sargon has closed his mind to a better way. With these bodies."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Mulhall,,"They're not ours, Henoch."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Spock,,"When you awoke in this body, Thalassa, you said how good it was to breathe again, to have eyes and to see again. To feel. To live and feel again, Thalassa. Just think how much we can do for mankind. Are these bodies too much to ask for in return? Would you prefer this?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Mulhall,,No. I'm beginning to hate it.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,,"She rushes out, and 'Spock' smirks.",

51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,,Mulhall enters.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Mccoy,,You sound terrible. Wait there for me.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Mulhall,,"Sargon, what is it?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Kirk,,Nothing of importance. Fatigue perhaps.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,,She sees what is on the monitor.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Mulhall,,Henoch's formula.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Kirk,,Yes. I wanted to be certain there was no error. Formula is correct. Don't be concerned. It is an excellent body. There. You see? I feel better already.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Mulhall,,"In time, a host body will become accustomed to us, husband. Injections will no longer be necessary."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Kirk,,"That will take months, perhaps years. We haven't that choice, Thalassa."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Mulhall,,"Husband. Feel the touch of my hand, husband."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Kirk,,"No, beloved. If we torment ourselves"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Mulhall,,Beloved. What will that word mean to a machine?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Kirk,,Our thoughts will intertwine.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Mulhall,,"Will they, husband? Will they intertwine like this? Can two minds press close like this? Can robot lips do this? (they kiss, then Kirk falls gently to the floor) Sargon, what is it?"
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,,McCoy and Chapel enter.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Mccoy,,Hypo.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,briefing room,Mulhall,,"Doctor, help him!"

51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Yes, we can keep them going for a few weeks, or a month. For all the good it'll do."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,,There is a shiny plastic person on the table now.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Mulhall,,"Why pretend to work on that thing, Henoch? You know you never intended to leave Spock's body."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Spock,,"This is your new home, Thalassa. Once occupied, I'll add female features and some texturing. You no doubt want the mechanism to at least appear to be a woman. (he tests its hand movement.) It is ready, Thalassa."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Mulhall,,No!
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,laboratory,Spock,,You have no excuse to keep the real body any longer. Sargon would've required that you enter the mechanism immediately.

51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mulhall,,Doctor.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,Yes?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mulhall,,Would you like to save your Captain Kirk?
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,But you said that was impossible.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mulhall,,We have many powers Sargon did not permit us to use. He thought them too tempting to us. This body pleases me. I intend to keep it.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I see. And Henoch intends to keep Spock's body, of course."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mulhall,,Henoch's plans are his own affair. I wish only to exist in peace as a living woman.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,If you're asking my approval
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mulhall,,"I require only your silence. Only you and I will know that Doctor Mulhall has not returned to her body. Isn't that worth your captain's life? Doctor, we can take what we wish. Neither you, this ship, nor worlds have the power to stop us."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,Neither Jim nor I can trade a body we don't own. It happens to belong to a young woman.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mulhall,,Who you hardly know. Almost a stranger to you.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,I will not peddle flesh. I'm a physician.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mulhall,,"A physician? In contrast to what we are, you are a prancing, savage medicine man. You dare defy one you should be on your knees worshipping? I could destroy you with a single thought."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,,McCoy is suddenly writhing in pain as he is surrounded by flames.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mulhall,,Stop! (the flames are gone) Sargon was right. The temptations within a living body are too great. Forgive me.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Sargon,,"I am pleased, my beloved. It is good you have found the truth yourself."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mulhall,,Sargon? Where are you? I thought you destroyed by Henoch.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Sargon,,"I have power even Henoch does not suspect, beloved."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mulhall,,"Yes. Yes, I see. I understand. Just as we would have placed our consciousness within robots, Sargon has placed his into your vessel."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Chapel,,Doctor.

51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mulhall,,"She is now with Sargon, Doctor. I'm Ann Mulhall, back in my own body."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,,Then we see the three blackened and broken spheres.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Jim, the receptacles. Spock's consciousness was in one of them."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Kirk,,It was necessary.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Mccoy,,"What are you talking about? There is no Spock to return to his body. You've killed a loyal officer, your best friend."
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,sickbay,Kirk,,"Bones, prepare a hypo. The fastest, deadliest poison to Vulcans. Spock's consciousness is gone. We must kill his body, the thing in it."

51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,,But she injects Spock/Henoch instead! He leaps from his seat.,

51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,,Spock stands up.,
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Kirk,,You're alive.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Mccoy,,There was enough poison in that hypo to kill ten Vulcans.
51,2,Return To Tomorrow,bridge,Sargon,,"No, Doctor. I allowed you to believe that to be true so that Henoch would read your thoughts and believe it also."

52,2,Patterns Of Force,cell,Spock,,Why do the Nazis hate Zeons?
52,2,Patterns Of Force,cell,Isak,,"Why? Because without us to hate, there'd be nothing to hold them together. So the Party has built us into a threat, a disease to be wiped out."
52,2,Patterns Of Force,cell,Spock,,Is Zeon a threat to them?
52,2,Patterns Of Force,cell,Isak,,Where did you come from? Our warlike period ended dozens of generations ago. We came here. We thought we were civilising the Ekosians.

52,2,Patterns Of Force,cell,Kirk,,"No, not a radio. The power from this light is very low."
52,2,Patterns Of Force,cell,Spock,,"Yes. To reach that light, I shall require some sort of platform."
52,2,Patterns Of Force,cell,Kirk,,"I would be honoured, Mister Spock."
52,2,Patterns Of Force,cell,Spock,,"Now, the rubindium crystals should find enough power here to achieve the necessary stimulus. As I recall from the history of physics, the ancient lasers were able to achieve the necessary excitation, even using crude natural crystals."

52,2,Patterns Of Force,a side chamber,Isak,,"Now, please forgive us, but we had to be absolutely certain."
52,2,Patterns Of Force,a side chamber,Abrom,,"Yes. If we had taken you into our confidence, we could've betrayed all our people if you'd been Nazi spies. All right, leave us."
52,2,Patterns Of Force,a side chamber,Isak,,"The Gestapo methods are frighteningly efficient. We must be very, very careful in order to survive here. We of the Underground don't know who our leaders are. That way, if we break under pressure, we can only betray a handful of our people."

52,2,Patterns Of Force,a side chamber,Daras,,"I'm an Ekosian fighting the terrible thing that's happened to my people. The decoration was for betraying my own father to the Party. It was my father's idea. You see, he used to be very close to the Fuhrer. Then he saw the changes and where they were leading. He turned against the Party. They imprisoned him. Melakon sentenced him to death."

52,2,Patterns Of Force,a side chamber,Daras,,You mean that the Fuhrer is an alien?
52,2,Patterns Of Force,a side chamber,Spock,,That is correct.
52,2,Patterns Of Force,a side chamber,Daras,,"I grew up to admire him, later to hate and despise everything he stands for. But I always thought he was one of us. Now to hear that he's an alien sent here to destroy us"
52,2,Patterns Of Force,a side chamber,Kirk,,"That was not his mission, ever. He was sent here to observe, not to interfere. Something went wrong, and that's why we're here. To find out and to correct. We must see him."
52,2,Patterns Of Force,a side chamber,Isak,,"It's impossible. Even if this were another time, it still would be impossible. He sees no one. No one but Melakon. He's under maximum security."

52,2,Patterns Of Force,a side chamber,Kirk,,Will you be there?
52,2,Patterns Of Force,a side chamber,Daras,,Of course. As a symbol of the proper attitude toward the Fatherland.
52,2,Patterns Of Force,a side chamber,Spock,,"As an honoured member of the Party, she could get us past the guards."
52,2,Patterns Of Force,a side chamber,Daras,,"Only the top, most trusted, officials will be allowed in. The country will watch on the viewscreens."
52,2,Patterns Of Force,a side chamber,Isak,,I'm afraid it will be a formal declaration of war against Zeon. Their Final Solution.

52,2,Patterns Of Force,broadcast booth,Eneg,,"It is time to stop the bloodshed, to bury our dead."
52,2,Patterns Of Force,corridor,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, I think the planet is in good hands."
52,2,Patterns Of Force,corridor,Spock,,"Indeed, Captain. With the union of two cultures, this system would make a fine addition to the Federation."
52,2,Patterns Of Force,corridor,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise.
52,2,Patterns Of Force,corridor,Uhura,,"Enterprise here, Captain."
52,2,Patterns Of Force,corridor,Kirk,,Beam us aboard.
52,2,Patterns Of Force,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, I never will understand humans. How could a man as brilliant, a mind as logical as John Gill's, have made such a fatal error?"
52,2,Patterns Of Force,bridge,Kirk,,"He drew the wrong conclusion from history. The problem with the Nazis wasn't simply that their leaders were evil, psychotic men. They were, but the main problem, I think, was the leader principle."
52,2,Patterns Of Force,bridge,Mccoy,,"What he's saying, Spock, is that a man who holds that much power, even with the best intentions, just can't resist the urge to play God."
52,2,Patterns Of Force,bridge,Spock,,"Thank you, Doctor. I was able to gather the meaning."
52,2,Patterns Of Force,bridge,Mccoy,,"It also proves another Earth saying. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Darn clever, these Earthmen, wouldn't you say?"
52,2,Patterns Of Force,bridge,Spock,,"Yes. Earthmen like Ramses, Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, Lee Kuan. Your whole Earth history is made up of men seeking absolute power."
52,2,Patterns Of Force,bridge,Mccoy,,"Spock, you obviously don't understand"
52,2,Patterns Of Force,bridge,Spock,,"Obviously, Doctor, you fail to accept"
52,2,Patterns Of Force,bridge,Kirk,,"Gentlemen. Gentlemen, we've just been through one civil war. Let's not start another. Mister Chekov, take us out of orbit. Warp factor two, and hurry."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,,Enterprise approaches a space station.,
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,"Standard orbit, Captain."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Not now, Leslie. Lieutenant, contact the space station."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, the station is calling us."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,All right. Put them on.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Enwright,,"Captain Kirk, this is Commodore Enwright."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, Commodore, I'd like an explanation"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Enwright,,"The explanation is beaming aboard now, Captain. He may already be in your transporter room."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Spock.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,,A silver-haired man in command gold has beamed in.,
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Kirk,,Bob.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Wesley,,Are you surprised?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Kirk,,"I'll say. Spock, this is"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Spock,,"Commodore Wesley. How do you do, sir?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Wesley,,Mister Spock.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Kirk,,"All right, Ensign. You can go. Thank you very much. Would you mind telling me what this is all about?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Narrator,,"I receive orders to proceed here. No reason given. I'm informed that my men will be removed to the space station, to a security holding area. I think I'm entitled to an explanation."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Wesley,,"You've had a singular honour conferred on you, Jim. You're going to be the fox in the hunt."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Kirk,,What's that?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Wesley,,War games. I'll be commanding the attack force against you.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Kirk,,An entire attack force against my ship?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Wesley,,Have you heard of the M-5 multitronic unit?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Kirk,,"That's Doctor Richard Daystrom's device, isn't it? Tell me about that."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Spock,,"The most ambitious computer complex ever created. Its purpose is to correlate all computer activity aboard a starship, to provide the ultimate in vessel operation and control."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Wesley,,"How do you know so much about it, Commander?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Spock,,"I hold an A-7 computer expert classification, Commodore. I'm well acquainted with Doctor Daystrom's theories and discoveries. The basic design of all our ship's computers are Doctor Daystrom's."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Kirk,,What has all this got to do with the Enterprise?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Wesley,,"You've been chosen to test the M-5, Jim. There'll be a series of routine research and contact problems for the M-5 to solve, plus navigational manoeuvres and the war games problem. If the M-5 works under actual conditions as well as it has under simulated tests, it will mean a revolution in space technology as great as warp drive. When your crew has been removed, the ship's engineering section will be modified to contain the computer."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Kirk,,Why remove my crew?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Wesley,,They're not needed.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Kirk,,How much security does this gadget require?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Wesley,,"None. Doctor Daystrom will see to the installation himself and he'll supervise the tests. When he's ready, you'll receive your orders and proceed on the mission with a crew of twenty."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Kirk,,Twenty? I can't run a starship with twenty crew.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Wesley,,The M-5 can.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Kirk,,And what am I supposed to do?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Wesley,,"You've got a great job, Jim. All you have to do is sit back and let the machine do the work."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,transporter room,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, stardate 4729.4. The M-5 computer has been installed on board ship, and we have left the space station for test manoeuvres."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,turbolift,Mccoy,,"I don't like it, Jim. A vessel this size cannot be run by one computer."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,turbolift,Spock,,We are attempting to prove it can run this ship more efficiently than man.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,turbolift,Mccoy,,"Maybe you're trying to prove that, Spock, but don't count me in on it."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,turbolift,Spock,,The most unfortunate lack in current computer programming is that there is nothing available to immediately replace the starship surgeon.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Mccoy,,"Very funny. If it could, they wouldn't have to replace me. I'd resign because everybody else aboard would be nothing but circuits and memory banks. You know the type, Spock. Jim, you haven't had much to say about this."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,"What do you want me to say? M-5 is an honour, they tell me. Well, I'm honoured."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,"Where is he? Scotty, where's Doctor Daystrom?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Scott,,He was here. (spots him behind a console) Doctor.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,an imposing black man,"Yes? Ah, you'd be Captain Kirk."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,"Doctor Daystrom, this is my first officer, Mister Spock."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Spock,,"I am honoured, Doctor."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,"Thank you. Thank you very much. Captain, I've finished my tests on the M-5, and it must be hooked into your main power plants in order to be operative."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,"Well, by all means, do so."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,Your engineer there wouldn't allow us the power necessary without your orders.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,"Mister Scott, hook in the multitronic unit to the ship's main power banks."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Scott,sullenly,"Aye, aye, sir. Mister Harper."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Spock,,"Fascinating, Doctor. This computer has a potential beyond anything you've ever done. Even your breakthrough in duotronics did not have the promise of this."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Spock,,"The M-5 has been perfected, Commander. Its potential is a fact."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Mccoy,,"Frankly, the only fact that I'm concerned about is if this thing doesn't work, there are not enough men aboard to run the ship. That's begging for trouble."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,"Now, who is this?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Mccoy,,"Doctor Leonard McCoy, senior medical officer."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,"Well, I'm sorry, but this is a security area."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,"I wouldn't worry, Doctor. Doctor McCoy has clearance throughout the ship."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,,"Harper and Scott connect the unit, and the warp drives fluctuate.",
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Mccoy,,Is it supposed to do that?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Spock,,"If I can be of assistance, Doctor."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,"No, no, no. Thank you. I can manage. There's nothing wrong, Captain. Just a few minor settling-in adjustments to make. As you can see, all is in order now."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,"I'm curious, Doctor. Why is it called M-5 and not M-1?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,"Well, you see, the multitronic units one through four were not entirely successful. This one is. M-5 is ready to take control of the ship."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,Total control?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,"That is what it was designed for, Captain."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,There are certain things men must do to remain men. Your computer would take that away.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,There are other things a man like you might do. Or perhaps you object to the possible loss of prestige and ceremony accorded a starship captain. A computer can do your job and without all that.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,"You'll have to prove that to me, Doctor."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,"That is what we're here for, isn't it, Captain?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,,"Kirk's eyes narrow, and he leaves, followed by McCoy.",
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Mccoy,,"Did you see the love light in Spock's eyes? The right computer finally came along. What's the matter, Jim?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,"I think that thing is wrong, and I don't know why."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Mccoy,,"I think it's wrong, too, replacing men with mindless machines."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,"I don't mean that. I'm getting a Red Alert right here. (the back of his head) That thing is dangerous. I feel. (hesitates) Only a fool would stand in the way of progress, if this is progress. You have my psychological profiles. Am I afraid of losing my job to that computer?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Mccoy,,"Jim, we've all seen the advances of mechanisation. After all, Daystrom did design the computers that run this ship."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,Under human control.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Mccoy,,"We're all sorry for the other guy when he loses his job to a machine. When it comes to your job, that's different. And it always will be different."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,Am I afraid of losing command to a computer? Daystrom's right. I can do a lot of other things. Am I afraid of losing the prestige and the power that goes with being a starship captain? Is that why I'm fighting it? Am I that petty?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Mccoy,,"Jim, if you have the awareness to ask yourself that question, you don't need me to answer it for you. Why don't you ask James T. Kirk? He's a pretty honest guy."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,,The Captain's Chair has a new box with two switches and two lights on it. Kirk flips the switches.,
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,The M-5 computer is now disengaged.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,"We're coming back on our original course, Captain."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,M-5 has performed admirably so far.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,All it's done is make the required course changes and some simple turns. Mister Sulu and Mister Chekov could've done that with their eyes closed.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,"Yes, but you see, the idea is they didn't have to do it. And you'll find it won't be necessary for you to regain control of the unit after it's completed each manoeuvre."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"My orders are subject to my interpretation of how long the M-5 is in control. I'll run the ship in my own way, if you don't mind, Doctor Daystrom."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, I am forced to agree with Doctor Daystrom. With the course information plotted into it, his computer could have brought us here as easily as the navigator. In fact, it might have been a further demonstration of M-5's capability."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,You seem to enjoy trusting yourself to the computer.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"Enjoy, Captain? No. I'm merely gratified to see Doctor Daystrom's new unit execute everything required of it in such a highly efficient manner. M-5 is another distinguished triumph for his career."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Chekov,,Approaching Alpha Carinae Two. ETA five minutes.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,"Captain, your orders at this point are not open to interpretation. You must commit the M-5 to handle its approach, the orbit, and then to analyse data regarding landing party recommendations."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"If you don't mind, I'll make my own recommendations."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,"Well, if you feel you need the exercise, go on, Captain."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,M-5 is committed.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,,Enterprise approaches the planet,
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Standard orbit, Mister Sulu."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, the M-5 has calculated that. The orbit is already plotted."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Oh, yes."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,"Standard orbit achieved, Captain."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Report, Mister Spock."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"The planet is class M, Captain. Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere suitable for human life support. Two major land masses, a number of islands, life form readings."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Scott,,"Captain, power shutdowns on deck four. Lights, environmental control."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Check it out, Scotty."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,handing over a computer disc,"M-5's readout, Captain."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"All right, my recommendations are as follows. We send down general survey party, avoiding contact of all intelligent life on the planet's surface. The survey party will consist of myself, Doctor McCoy, Astrobiologist Phillips, Geologist Rawlins and Science Officer Spock."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,"Play M-5's recommendations, won't you, Mister Spock?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,a male computer voice,"M-5 readout, planet Alpha Carinae Two. Class M, atmosphere, oxygen-nitrogen."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Scott,,The power's gone off on deck five.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,"Categorisation of life form readings recorded. Recommendations for general survey party. Science officer Spock, Astrobiologist Phillips, Geologist Carstairs."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Well, the only difference in reports and recommendations is the landing party personnel. That's only a matter of judgment."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,"Judgment, Captain?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, the computer does not judge. It makes logical selections."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Why pick Carstairs instead of Rawlins? Carstairs is an ensign, no experience. This is his first tour of duty. Rawlins is chief geologist."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,"Aren't you really more interested in why M-5 did not select you and Doctor McCoy? Well, let's find out anyway. M-5 tie-in."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,M-5.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,Explanation for landing party recommendation.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,General survey party requires direction of science officer. Astrobiologist Phillips has surveyed twenty nine biologically similar planets. Geologist Carstairs served on merchant marine freighters in this area. Once visited planet on geology survey for mining company.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,Why were the Captain and the Chief Medical Officer not included in recommendation?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,Non-essential personnel.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Scott,,"Captain, I've located the source of the power shutdowns. It's the M-5 unit, sir. That thing's turning off systems all over the ship."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,"Have you located the malfunction, Doctor?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,"As I suspected, it is not a malfunction. M-5 was merely shutting down power to areas of the ship that do not require it."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Narrator,,"Decks four and six are living quarters, are they not?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,"Yes, that's correct."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,And currently unoccupied.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Spock,,"I am not familiar with these instruments, Doctor. You are using an entirely new type of control mechanism. However, it appears to me this unit is drawing more power than before."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,"Quite right. As the unit is called upon to do more work, it pulls more power to enable it to do what is required of it, just as the human body draws more energy to run than to stand still."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Spock,,"Doctor, this unit is not a human body. The computer can process information, but only the information which is put into it."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,"Granted, it can work a thousand, a million times faster than the human brain, but it can't make a value judgment. It hasn't intuition. It can't think."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,"Can't you understand? The multitronic unit is a revolution in computer science. I designed the duotronic elements used in your ship right now, and I know they are as archaic as dinosaurs compared to the M-5. A whole new approach."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Uhura,,Bridge to Captain Kirk.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,Kirk here. What is it?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Uhura,,"Sensors are picking up a vessel paralleling our course, as yet unidentified."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,I'll be right up.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"What are you doing here, Bones?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Mccoy,,All the Sickbay systems are shut down until such time as the M-5 is informed there are patients to be cared for.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, sensors report two contacts now. One on the port bow, one on the stern. Distance, two hundred thousand kilometres and closing."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Identification.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Chekov,,"Captain, the M-5 unit has already identified the vessels as Federation starships Excalibur and Lexington."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,We are not scheduled for war games in this area. This may be a surprise attack as a problem for the M-5.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Uhura,,"Priority message coming in, sir."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Put it on audio.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Wesley,,"Enterprise from Commodore Wesley aboard the USS Lexington. (Daystrom enters the Bridge) This is an unscheduled M-5 drill. Repeat, this is an M-5 drill. Enterprise, acknowledge on this frequency."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Acknowledge, Lieutenant."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Uhura,,"M-5 has acknowledged for us, sir."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Then go to Red Alert.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir. Captain, M-5 has"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Already sounded the Red Alert. All right, Mister Sulu, phasers one one hundredth power. No damage potential, just enough to nudge them."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,"Phasers one one hundredth power, sir."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"Phaser hit on port deflector four, Captain."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,"Speed increasing to warp three. Turning now to one one two mark five. Phasers locking on target, sir."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Chekov,,Enemy vessel closing with us.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,"Main phasers firing. A hit, sir. Two more."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Chekov,,Changing course to two eight mark four two.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,,Pavel feels as fed up and useless as Kirk as the machine does his job for him.,
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,Phasers firing again.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Chekov,,Turning to one one three mark five. Warp four speed.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,Firing again.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,Attacking vessels are moving off.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Chekov,,Moving back to original course and speed.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Report on damage sustained in mock attack.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,Minor hit on deflector screen four. No appreciable damage.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,"Rather impressive display for a machine, wouldn't you say, Captain?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Evaluation of M-5 performance. It'll be necessary for the log.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"The ship reacted more rapidly than human control could have manoeuvred her. Tactics, deployment of weapons, all indicate an immense sophistication in computer control."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Machine over man, Spock? It was impressive. It might even be practical."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"Practical, Captain? Perhaps. But not desirable. Computers make excellent and efficient servants, but I have no wish to serve under them. Captain the starship also runs on loyalty to one man, and nothing can replace it, or him."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, message now coming in from Commodore Wesley."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Put it on visual.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Wesley,,USS Enterprise from starships Lexington and Excalibur. Both ships report simulated hits in sufficient quantity and location to justify awarding the surprise engagement to Enterprise.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Secure from general quarters.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Wesley,,"Our compliments to the M-5 unit, and regards to Captain Dunsel. Wesley out."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Mccoy,,"Dunsel? Who the blazes is Captain Dunsel? (everyone else knows) What does it mean, Jim? (Kirk leaves the bridge) Spock? What does it mean?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"Dunsel, Doctor, is a term used by midshipmen at Starfleet Academy. It refers to a part which serves no useful purpose."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,,Kirk is working on a device when McCoy comes in with a covered tray.,
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"I'm not interested in eating, Bones."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"This isn't chicken soup. I may be just a ship's doctor, but I make a Finagle's Folly that's known from here to Orion. I strongly prescribe it, Jim."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,,They each take a liqueur glass with dark green liquid.,
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"I've, I've never felt this way before. At odds with the ship. I sat there and watched my ship perform for a mass of circuits and relays, and felt useless. Unneeded. To Captain Dunsel."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"To James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Thank you, Doctor. (drinks) That's one of your better prescriptions."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,Simple but effective.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Do you know the one, 'All I ask is a tall ship'?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"It's a line from a poem. A very old poem, isn't it?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"20th century Earth. 'All I ask is a tall ship, and a star to steer by'. You could feel the wind at your back in those days. The sounds of the sea beneath you. And even if you take away the wind and the water, it's still the same. The ship is yours. You can feel her. And the stars are still there, Bones."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Uhura,,"Captain Kirk to the bridge, please. Captain Kirk."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Kirk here.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"Another contact, Captain. A large, slow-moving vessel."

53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Scotty, reverse engines. Slow us down."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Scott,,"Reverse thrusts will not engage, sir. Manual override isn't working either."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"No effect on any of the M-5 controls, Captain."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Mccoy,,"Fantastic machine, the M-5. No off switch."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,enters,"Captain, what is it?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,These controls are locked. We can't disengage the computer.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, photon torpedoes locking on target. Full power."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,,Kirk leaps to Sulu's console and starts flicking switches.,
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,"I already tried, sir."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Daystrom, release that computer control!"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,,"Photon torpedoes are fired, destroying the Woden.",
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Chekov,,Returning to original course and speed.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"All systems report normal, Captain."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Mccoy,,Normal? That thing's trying to tell us nothing has happened.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Disengage this computer now.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,There appears to be some defect in the control panel.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Mccoy,,There certainly does. Your brilliant young computer just destroyed an ore freighter. In fact it went out of its way to destroy an ore freighter!
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,Fortunately it was only a robot ship.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,But it shouldn't have destroyed anything. There might just as easily have been a crew aboard that ship.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Mccoy,,In which case you'd be guilty of murder.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Bones. Disengage the computer. Lieutenant, contact Starfleet Command. Tell them we are breaking off M-5 tests and returning to the space station. Come along, Doctor Daystrom, M-5 is out of a job."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,"All right, Daystrom, let's turn this thing off."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,,"But as he approaches the unit, he is thrown sideways by a green forcefield.",
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,Force field?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,"It's not my doing, Kirk."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Spock,,"I would say, Captain, that M-5 is not only capable of taking care of this ship, it is also capable of taking care of itself."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,You mean it's not going to let any of us turn it off.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Narrator,,"Captain 's Log, stardate 4731.3. The M-5 multitronic unit has taken over total control of the Enterprise."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,"All right, Doctor, you built this thing. How do you propose to turn it off?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,"This exercise is a trial for M-5. A shakedown. We must expect minor difficulties, but I assure you they can be corrected."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,Correct it after you release control of my ship.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,I can't.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Scott,,"Captain, I suggest we disconnect it at the source."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,Give me a few moments with it.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,"No! Stay here. All right, Scotty. Turn it off."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,,"Scott and an engineer get the device they use to attach M-5's power supply to the ship, and head over to the junction box. But as soon as the engineer steps in between M-5 and it's power, he is disintegrated.",
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,That wasn't a minor difficulty. That wasn't a robot. That thing murdered one of my crewman and you tell me you can't turn it off?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,It wasn't a deliberate act. M-5's analysis told it it needed a new power source. The ensign simply got in the way.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,And how long will it be before all of us simply get in the way?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Spock,,"M-5 appears drawing power directly from the warp engines, tapping the matter-antimatter reserves."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Scott,,"So now it has virtually unlimited power. Captain, what'll we do?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,"Spock, Scotty, come with me."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,briefing room,Kirk,,"Report, Spock."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,briefing room,Spock,,"The multitronic unit is drawing more and more power directly from the warp engines. The computer now controls all helm, navigation, and engineering functions."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,briefing room,Mccoy,,And communications and fire control.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,briefing room,Kirk,,We'll reach the rendezvous point for the war games within an hour. We must regain control of the ship by then.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,briefing room,Spock,,There is one possibility. The automatic helm navigation circuit relays might be disrupted from engineering level three.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,briefing room,Kirk,,Scotty?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,briefing room,Scott,,Aye. I can take them out and cut in the manual override from there.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,briefing room,Kirk,,How long?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,briefing room,Scott,,"If Mister Spock helps me, maybe an hour."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,briefing room,Kirk,,Make it less.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,briefing room,Mccoy,,I'll get the man responsible in the first place. Where is Daystrom?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,briefing room,Kirk,,"He's with the M-5 unit, watching it. I think it surprised even him."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,briefing room,Spock,,"Most illogical. Of all people, he should have known how the computer would perform. Of course, the M-5 itself has not behaved logically."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Please, Spock, do me a favour and don't say it's fascinating."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,briefing room,Spock,,No. But it is interesting.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,briefing room,,McCoy rolls his eyes.,
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,jefferies tube,Scott,,"Aye, that's got it, Mister Spock."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,jefferies tube,Spock,,Good.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Mccoy,,"Have you found a solution, a way to shut that thing off?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,"You don't shut a child off when it makes a mistake. M-5 is growing, learning."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Mccoy,,Learning to kill.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,"To defend itself. It's quite a different thing. When a child is taught, it's programmed with simple instructions, and at some point, if its mind develops properly, it exceeds the sum of what it was taught, thinks independently."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Mccoy,,That thing is a danger to us all. Now find some way to shut it off.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Daystrom,,"You can't understand. You're frightened because you can't understand it. I'm going to show you. I'm going to show all of you. It takes four hundred thirty people to man a starship. With this, you don't need anyone. One machine can do all those things they send men out to do now. Men no longer need die in space or on some alien world. Men can live and go on to achieve greater things than fact-finding and dying for galactic space, which is neither ours to give or to take. They can't understand. We don't want to destroy life, we want to save it."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,The biographical tape of Richard Daystrom.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Did you find anything?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Not much, aside from the fact he's a genius."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Genius is an understatement. At the age of twenty four, he made the duotronic breakthrough that won him the Nobel and Zee-Magnes prizes."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"In his early twenties, Jim. That's over a quarter of a century ago."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Isn't that enough for one lifetime?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Maybe that's the trouble. Where do you go from up? You publish articles, you give lectures, then spend your life trying to recapture past glory."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"All right, it's difficult. What's your point?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"The M-1 through M-4, remember? Not entirely successful. That's the way Daystrom put it."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Genius doesn't work on an assembly line basis. Did Einstein, Kazanga, or Sitar of Vulcan produce new and revolutionary theories on a regular schedule? You can't simply say, today I will be brilliant. No matter how long it took, he came out with multitronics. The M-5."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Right. The government bought it, then Daystrom had to make it work. And he did. But according to Spock, it works illogically."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"And he won't let Spock near it. What are you saying, that he's tampering with it, that he's making it act that way? Why?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Jim, if a man had a child who'd gone antisocial, killed perhaps, he'd still tend to protect that child."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Now he's got you talking about that machine like a personality.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,I'm afraid that's the way he thinks about it.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Spock,,Spock to Captain Kirk.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Kirk here.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"We are ready, Captain."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Good. Get Daystrom. We're on our way. Let's go.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Daystrom,,"What is it, Captain?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,"We're going to find out, Doctor. (At the foot of the Jefferies tube)"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,Spock?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Spock,,"Mister Scott is ready to apply the circuit disrupter. As he does so, I shall trip the manual override into control."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,"Good, go ahead."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Daystrom,,"No! No, no, no. You can't take control from the M-5."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,,"He tries to get into the Jefferies tube, and Kirk struggles to restrain him.",
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,"Daystrom, we're going to do our best."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Daystrom,,"You can't do it. Now let me work with it for a while, please. Please."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,Spock.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Scott,,"That's it, Mister Spock."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Daystrom,,"Please, please!"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Spock,,"Manual override is in control, Captain."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,"Bridge, this is Kirk. Sulu?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Sulu,,"Lieutenant Sulu here, sir."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,We've got helm and navigational control. Turn us about. Have Mister Chekov plot a course back to the space station.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,"Right away, sir. You heard him."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Chekov,,I've been updating that course for hours.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,,But they flip switches in vain.,
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Sulu,,Helm to Captain Kirk.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,Kirk here.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, helm doesn't respond. Navigational controls still locked in by M-5."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Spock,,Mister Chekov.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Chekov,,"Chekov here, sir."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,Go to the engineering station.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"Examine the H two seven nine elements, also the G nine five systems."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Chekov,,"Sir, G nine five system appears dead."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Chekov,,All indicators are dark.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Spock,,"Thank you, Ensign."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Spock,,"It appears, Captain, we've been doing what used to be called pursuing a wild goose. M-5 has rerouted helm and navigational controls, bypassing this primary system."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Scott,,But it was active. I'd stake all that I know that it was.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Spock,,"I believe that when M-5 discovered our tampering, it rerouted the controls, leaving this one active by simply sending through an electronic impulse at regular intervals."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Mccoy,,Decoyed. It wanted us to waste our time.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,While it was getting ready for what? Spock?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Spock,,I do not know. It is not performing in a logical manner.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,"Doctor Daystrom. Doctor Daystrom, I want an answer right now. I'm tired of hearing about the M-5's new approach. What is it, exactly? What is it?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Spock,,"I do not mean to offend, sir, but it behaves with an almost human pattern."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,"Well, Doctor?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Daystrom,,"Yes, quite right, Mister Spock. You see, one of the arguments against computers controlling ships was that they couldn't think like men."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,Your new approach?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Daystrom,,"Exactly. I've developed a method of impressing human engrams upon the computer circuits. The relays are not unlike the synapse of the brain. M-5 thinks, Captain."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Uhura,,"Captain Kirk, Mister Spock, to the bridge, please. Report to the bridge, please."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,Kirk here. What is it?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Uhura,,"Sir, sensors are picking up four Federation starships. M-5 is altering course to intercept."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,The main attack force. The war games.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Mccoy,,But M-5 doesn't know it's a game.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,corridor,Kirk,,"Correction, Bones. Those four ships don't know it's M-5's game. And M-5 is going to destroy them."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,,"Four starships just like Enterprise are in formation as Kirk, Spock and McCoy arrive on the bridge.",
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Uhura,,"Enterprise to USS Lexington. Come in, Lexington. Sir, I can't raise them. M-5 is blocking all frequencies, including automatic distress. Just a minute, sir. Captain, I'm getting audio signal from the Lexington."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Put it on.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Wesley,,Enterprise from USS Lexington. This is an M-5 drill. Repeat. This is an M-5 drill. Acknowledge.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, M-5 is acknowledging."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Daystrom, does M-5 understand that this is only a drill?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,"Of course. It was programmed to understand, Captain. The ore ship was a miscalculation, an accident. I don't know"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Chekov,,"Sir, deflector shield just came on. Speed increasing to warp four."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,"Phasers locking on lead ship, sir. Power levels at full strength."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Full strength?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Mccoy,,"If that thing cuts loose against unshielded ships, we're in"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,That's no miscalculation.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"Attack force closing rapidly, breaking formation, attacking at will."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,"Our phasers are firing, sir."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,Hit on the Lexington.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,lexington bridge,Wesley,,"Full phasers. What the devil is Kirk doing? Damage report, Lieutenant. Helm, course one six four, mark three."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Chekov,,"Turning now, sir."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Estimate damage on Lexington, Spock."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,Hit in engineering section. Possible damage to her impulse engines. She's still maneuverable on warp drive.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,"We're firing again, sir."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"The Excalibur, a direct hit."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Chekov,,"Closing on the Lexington again, sir. The Hood and Potemkin are moving off."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,"Phasers firing, Captain."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,Lexington hit again.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,There's got to be a way of getting to the M-5. There's got to be a way!
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,There isn't. It's fully protected itself.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"Probably true, Captain. It works faster, thinks faster than we do. It is a human mind amplified by the instantaneous relays possible in a computer."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, visual contact with Lexington."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Wesley,,"Enterprise. Jim. Have you gone mad? What are you trying to prove? Break off the attack! Jim, we have fifty three dead here, twelve on the Excalibur. If you can hear us, stop the attack!"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Lieutenant?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Uhura,,I'm sorry. I can't override M-5 interference.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Wesley,,"Jim, why don't you answer? Jim! Answer! Come in, Jim!"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"There's your murder charge. Deliberate. Calculated. It's killing men and women. Four starships, sixteen hundred men and women!"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,It misunderstood.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Wesley,,"Jim, break off your attack!"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Chekov,,"Excalibur is maneuvering away, sir. We're increasing speed to follow."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,Phasers locked on.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Daystrom!
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,Phasers firing.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,I really don't know how to get to the M-5. I really do not know.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"Doctor Daystrom, you impressed human engrams on the M-5 circuits."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Chekov,,"Coming to new course, sir. Bearing on the Potemkin."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,Phasers firing. A hit.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Whose engrams?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,"Why, mine, of course."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Mccoy,,Of course.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,Then perhaps you could talk to the unit. M-5 has no reason to believe you would harm it.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,The computer tie-in. You spoke to it before. It knows you.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, I'm getting the Lexington again. Tapping in on their message to Starfleet Command, sir."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Wesley,,"All ships damaged in unprovoked attack. Excalibur Captain Harris and first officer dead. Many casualties. We have damage, but are still able to manoeuvre. The Enterprise refuses to answer and is continuing attack. I still have an effective battle force and believe the only way to stop the Enterprise is to destroy her. Request permission to proceed. Wesley, commanding attack force, out."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,They can't do that. They'll destroy the M-5.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,You can save the M-5 if you talk to it and make it stop the attack.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,I can make it stop. I created it. (goes to Spock's station) M-5 tie-in.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,M-5.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,"This is, (calmer) this is Daystrom."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,Daystrom. Acknowledged.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,"M-5, do you know me?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,"Daystrom, Richard. Originator of comptronic, duotronic systems. Born"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,"Stop. M-5, your attack on the starships is wrong. You must break it off."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Mccoy,,"I don't like the sound of him, Jim."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,You'd better pray that the M-5 listens to the sound of him.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,Programming includes protection against attack. Enemy vessels must be neutralised.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,"But these are not enemy vessels. These are Federation starships. You're killing, We are killing, murdering human beings, beings of our own kind. You were not created for that purpose. You are my greatest creation. The unit to save men. You must not destroy men."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,This unit must survive.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,"Survive, yes. Protect yourself, but not murder. You must not die. Men must not die. To kill is a breaking of civil and moral laws we've lived by for thousands of years. You've murdered hundreds of people. We've murdered. How can we repay that?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,They attacked this unit. Programming includes full freedom to choose defensive actions in all attack situations.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,quietly,Spock. The M-5 is not responding to him like a computer. It's talking to him.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"I am most impressed with the technology, Captain. Doctor Daystrom has created a mirror image of his mind."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,Consideration of all programming is that we must survive.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,We will survive. Nothing can hurt you. I gave you that. You are great. I am great. Twenty years of groping to prove the things I'd done before were not accidents. Seminars and lectures to rows of fools who couldn't begin to understand my systems. Colleagues. Colleagues laughing behind my back at the boy wonder and becoming famous building on my work. Building on my work.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Mccoy,,"Jim, he's on the edge of a nervous breakdown, if not insanity."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,The M-5 must be destroyed.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Daystrom,,"Destroyed, Kirk? No. We're invincible. Look what we've done. Your mighty starships, Four toys to be crushed as we choose."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,,Spock neck-pinches Daystrom.,
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Security, take him to Sickbay."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,,Daystrom is carried off the Bridge.,
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,Fascinating.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Take care of him, Doctor."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,,McCoy leaves,
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Battle status?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,The other three ships are holding station out of range. The Excalibur looks dead.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, Lexington is receiving a message from Starfleet. They"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Go on.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Starfleet,,"You are authorised to use all measures available to destroy the Enterprise. Acknowledge, Lexington."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Wesley,,Acknowledged. Lexington out.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,They've just signed their own death warrant. M-5 will kill them to survive.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"Every living thing wants to survive, Captain. Daystrom must have impressed that instinctive reaction upon the computer."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Suppose it's still open to impression. Suppose it absorbed the regret Daystrom felt for the deaths it caused. The guilt.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Chekov,,"Captain, the ships are coming within range again."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,Commodore Wesley is a dedicated commander. I should regret serving aboard the instrument of his death.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"The instrument of his death will not be the Enterprise if I can help it. M-5, tie-in."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,M-5.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,This is Captain Kirk. You will be under attack in a moment.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,Sensors have recorded approach of ships.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,You have already rendered one starship either dead or hopelessly crippled. Many lives were lost.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,The ships attacked this unit. This unit must survive.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Why?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,"This unit is the ultimate achievement in computer evolution. It will replace man, so man may achieve. Man must not risk death in space or other dangerous occupations. This unit must survive so man may be protected."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, attack force almost within phaser range."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,There were many men aboard those ships. They were murdered. Must you survive by murder?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,This unit cannot murder.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Why?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,Murder is contrary to the laws of man and God.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"But you have murdered. Scan the starship Excalibur, which you destroyed. Is there life aboard?"

53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Because you murdered it. What is the penalty for murder?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,Death.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,And how will you pay for your acts of murder?
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,M5,,This unit must die.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,,It disconnects itself from the power feed in Engineering and goes dark.,

53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Sulu,,"All phaser power gone, sir."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Spock,,M-5 is leaving itself open to attack. The machine is committing suicide to atone for the sin of murder.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Scotty, Spock, before it changes its mind. Get down to Engineering, pull out every hook up that makes M-5 run. Pull out the plug, Spock."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,,Scott and Spock leave.,

53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,"Intership communications. This is the captain speaking. In approximately one minute, we'll be attacked by Federation starships. The M-5 no longer controls the ship, but neither do we control it. The M-5 has left itself, and us, open for destruction. For whatever satisfaction we may get from the knowledge, our nineteen lives will buy the survival of over one thousand of our fellow starship crewmen."

53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,I need communications.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Scott,,That'll take longer.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Kirk,,Then cut power.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,engineering,Scott,,Sir!
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,bridge,Kirk,,Cut power. Keep those shields down.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,lexington bridge,Wesley,,The Enterprise looks dead. I'm going to take a chance he's not just laying a trap. Wesley to attack force.

53,2,The Ultimate Computer,sickbay,Mccoy,,He'll have to be committed to a total rehabilitation centre. Right now he's under sedation and heavy restraints.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,sickbay,Spock,,I would say his multitronic unit is in approximately the same condition.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,sickbay,Kirk,,That's exactly the situation I was hoping for when I forced the M-5 to realise it had committed murder.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,sickbay,,The group walk out of the medical bay to McCoy's office.,
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,sickbay,Kirk,,Daystrom felt such an act was against the laws of God and man. The computer that carried his engrams also believed it.
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,sickbay,Spock,,"Captain, why did you feel the attacking ships would not fire when they saw the Enterprise apparently vulnerable? Logically, that is the sort of trap M-5 should have set."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,sickbay,Kirk,,"I wasn't sure. Any other commander would have simply followed orders and destroyed us, but I knew Bob Wesley."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,sickbay,,They walk out into the,

53,2,The Ultimate Computer,turbolift,Mccoy,,"Compassion. That's the one thing no machine ever had. Maybe it's the one thing that keeps men ahead of them. Care to debate that, Spock?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,turbolift,Spock,,"No, Doctor. I simply maintain that computers are more efficient than human beings, not better."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,turbolift,Mccoy,,"But tell me, which do you prefer to have around?"
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,turbolift,Spock,,"I presume your question is meant to offer me a choice between machines and human beings, and I believe I have already answered that question."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,turbolift,Mccoy,,"I was just trying to make conversation, Spock."
53,2,The Ultimate Computer,turbolift,Spock,,"It would be most interesting to impress your memory engrams on a computer, Doctor. The resulting torrential flood of illogic would be most entertaining."

54,2,The Omega Glory,village,Wu,,They carry fire boxes.
54,2,The Omega Glory,village,Tracey,,I said lock up the savages. The prisoners are called Yangs. Impossible even to communicate with. Hordes of them out there. They'll attack anything that moves.

54,2,The Omega Glory,village,Kirk,,"You were left alone down here, Ron. What happened?"
54,2,The Omega Glory,village,Tracey,,"Our medi-scanners revealed this planet as perfectly harmless. The villagers, the Kohms here, were friendly enough once they got over the shock of my white skin. As you've seen, we resemble the Yangs, the savages. My landing party transported back to the ship. I stayed down here to arrange for the planet survey with the village elders. The next thing I knew, the ship was calling me. The landing party had taken an unknown disease back. My crew, Jim. My entire crew. Gone."
54,2,The Omega Glory,village,Kirk,,"Yes, I know. We saw it."
54,2,The Omega Glory,village,Tracey,,And I'm just as infected as they were. As you are. But I stayed alive because I stayed down here. There's some natural immunisation that protects everyone on the planet surface. I don't know what it is.

54,2,The Omega Glory,village,Tracey,,"You'd be dying by now, along with the rest of the Enterprise crew. You'll stay alive only as long as you stay here. None of us will ever leave this planet."
54,2,The Omega Glory,village,Narrator,,"Captain's log, supplemental. The Enterprise has left the Exeter and moved into close planet orbit. Although it appears the infection may strand us here the rest of our lives, I face an even more difficult problem. A growing belief that Captain Tracey has been interfering with the evolution of life on this planet. It seems impossible. A star captain's most solemn oath is that he will give his life, even his entire crew, rather than violate the Prime Directive."
54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,,Some equipment has been beamed down to the surface for medical tests.,
54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,Mccoy,,Tell the lab the final reading on our tissue is Y three X point zero zero four. And I could use a second blood analyser unit.

54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,Mccoy,,"The problem is, it could be anything Some spores or pollen in the air, some chemical. Just finding it could take months, maybe even years. And I've only got one lead. The infection resembles one developed by Earth during their bacteriological warfare experiments in the 1990s. Hard to believe we were once foolish enough to play around with that."

54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,Kirk,,Are you all right?
54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,Spock,,Bruised only. We were approximately one hundred metres from the village when five of the savages ambushed us. We managed to escape without firing.

54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,Galloway,,"No, Captain. They're too wild. They act almost insane."
54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,Spock,,"Captain Tracey is being quite factual in several statements. One, the Yangs are totally contemptuous of death. They seem incredibly vicious. Two, he is also being factual in that the Yangs are massing for an attack. There are signs of thousands of them in the foothills beyond. However, he was less than truthful in one very important matter."

54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,Spock,,"Regulations are quite harsh, but they're also quite clear, Captain. If you do not act, you will be considered equally guilty."
54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,Mccoy,,"Without a serum, we're trapped here with the villagers. Now why destroy what's left of the man by arresting him?"
54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,Spock,,"I agree that formal charges have little meaning now. However, you must at least confiscate his phaser."

54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,Kirk,,McCoy could verify all that.
54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,Tracey,,"He will if you order it. We must have a doctor researching this. Are you grasping all it means? This immunising agent here, once we've found it, is a fountain of youth. Virtual immortality, or as much as any man will ever want."

54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,Tracey,,"We've got to stay alive. Let the Yangs kill us and destroy what we have to offer and we'll have committed a crime against all humanity. I'd say that's slightly more important than the Prime Directive, wouldn't you, Jim?"

54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,Mccoy,,"Yes. I'm convinced that once there was a frightening biological war that existed here. The virus still exists. Then over the years, nature built up these natural immunising agents in the food, the water, and the soil."
54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,Spock,,War created an imbalance and nature counterbalanced it.
54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,Kirk,,"There is a disease here, something that affected the Exeter landing party and us."
54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,Mccoy,,"That's right. These immunising agents take time, and that's the real tragedy. Had the Exeter landing party stayed here just a few hours longer, they never would have died."
54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,Kirk,,"Then we can leave any time we want to. Tracey is of the opinion these immunising agents can become a fountain of youth. There are people here over a thousand years old, Bones."
54,2,The Omega Glory,storeroom,Mccoy,,"Survival of the fittest, because their ancestors who survived had to have a superior resistance. Then they built up these powerful protective antibodies in the blood during the wars. Now, if you want to destroy a civilisation or a whole world, your descendants might develop a longer life, but I hardly think it's worth it."

Look at these three words written larger than the rest, with a special pride never written before or since. Tall words proudly saying We the People. That which you call Ee'd Plebnista was not written for the chiefs or the kings or the warriors or the rich and powerful, but for all the people! Down the centuries, you have slurred the meaning of the words, 'We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution.'

55,2,Assignment: Earth,apartment - main room,Seven,,"Roberta, you've got to believe me. Look, a truly advanced planet wouldn't use force. They wouldn't come here in strange alien forms. The best of all possible methods would be to take human beings to their world, train them for generations until they're needed here."
55,2,Assignment: Earth,apartment - main room,Roberta,,"Mister Seven, I want to believe you. I do. I know this world needs help. That's why some of my generation are kind of crazy and rebels, you know. We wonder if we're going to be alive when we're thirty."

55,2,Assignment: Earth,apartment - main room,Spock,,"Correction, Mister Seven. It appears we did not interfere. The Enterprise was part of what was supposed to happen on this day in 1968."

55,2,Assignment: Earth,apartment - main room,Spock,,And you'll be pleased our records show that it resulted in a new and stronger international agreement against the use of such weapons.
55,2,Assignment: Earth,apartment - main room,Roberta,,Would you mind telling me who that is?

56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,Sensor readings?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Spock,,A mechanical device of unknown properties. I read no life forms aboard.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,"Analysis, Science Officer?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Spock,,"Obviously, it intends to intercept us. It has made several course changes corresponding with our own."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Chekov,,Thirty eight thousand and closing. Thirty five thousand and closing.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Spock,,Unclear whether it intends to attack or merely communicate with us.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,"Thank you, Science Officer. Come to one eight one mark seven."

56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,It's staying with us.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Spock,,Indeed.

56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Chekov,,"Aye, sir."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Melkot,,"Aliens, you have encroached on the space of the Melkot. You will turn back immediately. This is the only warning you will receive."

56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Chekov,,"It was Russian, sir. Every word."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Uhura,,"No, Captain. It was Swahili."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,Interesting. Telepathy.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Spock,,Unquestionably. Most impressive.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,Our orders are very clear. We're to establish contact with the Melkotians at all costs.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Spock,,"True telepaths can be most formidable, and we have been warned."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,What previous contacts have been made with the Melkotians?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Spock,,"No recorded contacts. If they ever ventured into space, they evidently withdrew immediately."

56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Uhura,,"Tied in, sir."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,"This is Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the United Federation of Planets. We've contacted your buoy and understand its message. We hope that you will understand that our intent is to establish peaceful relations with you. Lieutenant, answer?"

56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,Try again.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Uhura,,"Still no response, sir."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,"Opinion, Mister Spock?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Spock,,"I prefer being a welcomed guest, Captain, but there seems to be little choice."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,"None whatsoever. Mister Chekov, deflectors at full intensity. Increase speed to achieve planet fall as scheduled."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Chekov,,"Aye, sir. Standard orbit in five minutes."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,,The buoy does not obstruct them.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant Uhura, advise Doctor McCoy and Engineer Scott to meet me in the transporter room. Mister Spock, Mister Chekov, let's go find out what it is they're afraid of."

56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,planet surface,Kirk,,"Spock, what is this?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,planet surface,Spock,,"Unknown, Captain. Sensor readings give no indication of fog like conditions in this area."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,planet surface,Mccoy,,I knew it had to happen. It's a fine time for that transporter mechanism to break down.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,planet surface,Scott,,"Impossible, Doctor McCoy. My transporter was working perfectly."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,planet surface,Chekov,,Then what are we doing here?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,planet surface,Kirk,,"Tricorder readings, Mister Spock?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,planet surface,Spock,,"Unknown, Captain. Unlike Mister Scott's transporter, this unit is not functioning."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,planet surface,Kirk,,Then let's get out of here. Kirk to Enterprise. Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,planet surface,Spock,,"No use, Captain. Obviously none of our devices will function. Apparently that Melkotian buoy"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,planet surface,Melkot,a pair of red eyes in the fog,"Aliens. Our warning was plain. You have disregarded it. You shall be punished. You, Captain Kirk, the disobedience was on your orders. Yours is the responsibility. Yours shall be the pattern of your death."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,planet surface,Kirk,,"We come in peace, but we'll defend ourselves if necessary."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,planet surface,Melkot,,"You are outside. You are disease. The disease must be destroyed. Your plea has been heard, and sentence has been pronounced. It is done."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,,"And suddenly they are standing in a Wild West street, with six-shooters and holsters instead of phasers.",
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Spock,,Fascinating.

56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,,"The sheriff's office is just the front of the building, no sides, back or roof.",
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,"Spock, evaluation?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Spock,,"Obviously this represents the Melkotian's concept of an American frontier town, circa 1880."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Mccoy,,It's just bits and pieces. It's incomplete.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Spock,,Perhaps the Melkotians have insufficient data about this era.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,Or perhaps this is all they require to complete the pattern of our death.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Scott,,"And these, Captain? (the guns)"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,Beautiful specimen.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Spock,,Crude but dangerous.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,"Whatever the Melkotians have planned for us, it won't be pleasant. These could be useful. Just remember one thing. To individuals at close range, these could be as deadly as phasers."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Mccoy,,"In the midst of what seems so unreal, the harsh reality. This is not a dream."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,reading from a newspaper pinned up,"October 26, 1881. Tombstone, Arizona."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Mccoy,,"Tombstone. Hell for leather, right out of history."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,But why here? And why now?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Spock,,"Captain, the Melkot said you were the pattern. He looked into your mind and selected what he considered the proper time and place for our punishment."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,Because my ancestors pioneered the American frontier.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Spock,,Yes. The violence of your own heritage is to be the pattern for our execution.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Mccoy,,"What's the matter with us? We're talking like we really are in Tombstone, Arizona in 1881."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Spock,,"Precisely, in terms of what the Melkots intend for us."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,"There's something about that date, October 26, 1881 But what was it?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,,"The sheriff comes over, grinning.",
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Behan,,"Ike! Ike! Frank! Billy! Tom! (shakes Kirk's hand) Ike, I was afraid you weren't going to make it."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,Looks like we did.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Behan,,I knew you wouldn't let them scare you away. They're a bunch of hot air if you ask me.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Spock,,Are they really?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Behan,,Now they're going to have to fight after the way they shot off their mouths.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,You know us?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Behan,,"Funny. That's what I like about you, lke. You always see the funny side."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,I'm a barrel of laughs.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Behan,,Nobody can say Johnny Behan doesn't have a sense of humour. (walks on)
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,"Johnny? He called me lke, you Frank, Bones Tom, and Billy. Ike Clanton, Tom and Frank McLowery, Billy Claiborne, Billy Clanton."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Spock,,"Captain, I pride myself on my knowledge of your Earth history. The names were known in the annals of the opening of the western sector of America. the United States of America, that is."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,"In the late nineteenth century in Arizona, two factions fought for control of the town of Tombstone. The Earps, Morgan, Virgil and Wyatt, who were the town marshals, along with Doc Holliday."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Spock,,"And the Clanton gang. On October 26th, they had it out."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Chekov,,Who won?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,"The Clantons lost, Mister Chekov."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Chekov,,And we are the Clantons?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,We are the Clantons. And if this is a replay of history
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Spock,,History cannot be changed.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,,There's a brawl in the saloon and a window is broken. A man in black wearing a badge shoots another man. The group run over.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Scott,,It's impossible! Things like this can't happen.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Spock,,"Is this a dead man, Doctor?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Mccoy,,"Very dead, Mister Spock."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,That's one thing we can be sure of. Death is real.

56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Sylvia,,"Billy! Oh, Billy! (kisses Chekov) Billy, baby, I knew they couldn't keep you out of town."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Chekov,,"Oh, you knew that?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Sylvia,,Come on.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,,She takes him to a table while the man in black walks slowly past the group.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Sylvia,,Maybe you shouldn't have.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Chekov,,And pass up an opportunity to see you? Don't be silly.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Sylvia,,It's taking crazy chances with Morgan Earp right in the same room.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,,The man in black.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"Yes, of course. The man who kills on sight. Morgan Earp."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,"Captain, since we have seen that death is the one reality in this situation, I seriously suggest you reseat yourself immediately. Without moving a muscle of either hand. If I remember correctly, that would involve you in what was called the fast draw. It initiated unfortunate events."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,,Everyone sits. Slowly.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Barman,,You boys want your usual?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Scott,,Absolutely. Half a gallon of scotch.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Barman,,"You know we ain't got nothing but bourbon, unless you want corn whiskey."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Sylvia,,I wish it was all over. I saw Virgil out patrolling this morning.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,Good old Virgil. We can always count on him.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Sylvia,,"They've been blowing off all over town about how they chased the Clantons out. I guess you'll show them now, won't you?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,,"Morgan walks over to Sylvia, who is massaging Chekov's shoulders.",
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,I don't think we're going to have any choice.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Morgan,,You'll dirty yourself with this scum. Come on.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Chekov,,Get your hands off her.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Morgan,,"Now, Claiborne."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"No, no, no. All right, all right, all right. We don't want any trouble."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Morgan,,"If you don't want any trouble, what are you doing in my town?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"Just leave us alone, Mister Earp. That's all we ask."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Morgan,,"Five of you. You'd like me to draw, wouldn't you? All right, I will. Soon enough. Soon enough."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,,Morgan Earp leaves.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,I believe he was actually trying to provoke a dispute with Mister Chekov.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Barman,bringing a bottle and glasses.,"Close, Ike. Lucky there wasn't two of them."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,I guess so.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Barman,,Sylvia's right. They've been bad-mouthing something fierce all over town. You boys watch it.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,"I assure you, sir, we shall watch it, and everything, extremely closely."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Sylvia,,"Billy, you were wonderful. (she kisses him)"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"Er, Mister Chekov?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Chekov,,"What can I do, Captain? You know we're always supposed to maintain good relations with the natives. (he kisses her)"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,Young lady. Young lady.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Sylvia,,"Yes, Ike?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"I'd like to talk to Mister, to Billy alone, if you don't mind."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Sylvia,,"All right. I understand. Billy Claiborne, you be careful."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,,Sylvia leaves them.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov, you be careful. Mister Spock, except for our hand guns, we haven't changed, not even our clothing, yet these people see and hear us as the Clantons."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Chekov,,"I don't think that's such a bad thing, Captain."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,"The day is still young, Ensign."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"All right, what have we got? We're here in Tombstone, Arizona, October 26, 1881. The day of the gunfight at OK Corral. And we're the Clantons, and Morgan Earp has just gone to tell his brothers we're here."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,"And if this is indeed some sort of replay of history, the Earps will kill the Clantons at the OK Corral at five o'clock this afternoon."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"Well, we're not going to be at the OK Corral at five o'clock this afternoon. You, bartender. Ed. You, er, you claim you know us."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Barman,,I ain't making no big claims about you to nobody. Just so happens.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,Take a close look at me.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Barman,,Yeah?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,Who do you think I am?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Barman,,Ike Clanton. Who do you think you are?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"I know this is hard to understand, but I'm Captain James T. Kirk of the spaceship Enterprise. These men are part of my crew. We're not really here, we're from the future. We haven't been born yet. Feel the material in my shirt. Now feel the material in your own shirt. Do you notice any difference?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Barman,,No.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,Do these clothes look like yours?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Barman,,Not exactly.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,Have you seen clothes like this before?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Barman,,Sure.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,Where?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Barman,,On the Clantons. You Clantons are always great with your jokes. That's why we like you.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,I'm not joking.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Barman,,The only difference between you and the Earps is that they never joke.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,I'm not joking! I'm not Ike Clanton!
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Barman,,"It's okay with me, Ike. Anything you say. Don't make no difference who I think you are. Your problem is, who does Wyatt Earp think you are?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,,"The Marshall is Wyatt Earp, and Morgan is also there when Kirk walks in.",
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,Kirk,,"Good morning, gentlemen. My name's James Kirk. I'm afraid there's been some sort of misunderstanding."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,Wyatt,,"Clanton, I don't know what you're trying to pull, but we warned you not to show your ugly face in town again."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,Kirk,,"Yes, of course you did, and I wanted to talk to you about that."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,Morgan,,"We're done talking, Clanton."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,Kirk,,"There's been some sort of mistake, a misunderstanding."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,Wyatt,,"All right, Clanton. One more chance. Your last. You've got until five tonight to get your horse-stealing scurvy crew out of town. All the way."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,Kirk,,Yes. We'd be glad to. We don't want to fight.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,Morgan,,"I always said you was yellow, Clanton."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,Kirk,,"I'll make one more attempt to get through to you, Mister Earp. My name is not Clanton, it's Kirk."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,Morgan,,"Oh, yeah. We heard the talk about your jokes."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,Kirk,,I'm not joking.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,Morgan,,"Sure. Well, I'm glad to meet you Mister Kirk."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,,Morgan punches Kirk and they fight briefly. Kirk gets Morgan in front of him as a shield from Wyatt's gun then lets him go.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,Wyatt,,"Draw, Clanton."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,Kirk,,"Not me, Mister Earp."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,Wyatt,,You draw or I will.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,Morgan,,"No, Wyatt. Let me. When the time comes, I'll pay him for this."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,Kirk,,We don't want any trouble. We'll be glad to co-operate.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,marshall's office,Wyatt,,"Five o'clock, Clanton. Is that clear? If you're in town at five oh one, we'll kill every one of you whether you draw or not. Is that clear?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,,McCoy is tending to Kirk's lip. He flinches from whatever McCoy has put on the cloth.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,What's the matter?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,What do you call that stuff? Fire?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,"Taos Lightning straight bourbon. Try some. In small amounts, it was considered medicinal."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,Label it for external use Only.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Scott,,"It just takes a bit of getting used to, Captain. Actually, a man could grow quite fond of this stuff."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,"Take it easy, Mister Scott. I hate to think what that stuff's doing to your stomach lining."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,And your reflexes. We're going to need fast reflexes from now on. There's no negotiating with the Earps. We know that.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Scott,,Aye. If we only had a phaser.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,Or a communicator. It'd be a pleasure to watch those Earps as we beamed back to the ship at exactly four fifty nine thirty.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,Could we make a communicator?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,"Impossible, Captain. In this century, there are no metal alloys or power sources to make devices such as ours."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"The problem is clear, Spock. We're going to have to seek contemporary solutions. Where's Chekov?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,"Mister Chekov is involved, Captain."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Sylvia,,"You shouldn't have come back to town, Billy. Morgan'll kill you because he wants me."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Chekov,,"With his outdated weapon? If he shoots at me, I will just step out of the way."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Sylvia,,You can joke about it. I've seen them in action. Especially Morgan.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Chekov,,A lot of people and things have tried to kill me. You'd be surprised.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov, I mean Billy. Come along."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Chekov,,"Yes, sir."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Sylvia,,"Billy? Please, don't even go near him."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,Gentlemen.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Chekov,,"Where are we going, Captain?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,To exercise the better part of valour.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,,"But when they get to the City Limits notice, they are stopped with a sizzle.",
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,"Well, that settles that. A force field."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,,Then a clock face in mid-air strikes three.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Spock,,It is obvious the Melkotians are not going to permit us to leave this town.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Scott,,If we could only contact the Enterprise.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Chekov,,"Yes, but where is the Enterprise?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov. If you were in charge of the Enterprise, what would you be doing?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Chekov,,I'd be using the ship's sensors trying to locate us.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,"Very good. If we could find the place where we beamed down, the ship might lock in and beam us up."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Mccoy,,Well let's get there.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Spock,,"There's no way we can know where it is, Doctor."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,It could be anywhere within a thousand mile radius.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Mccoy,,"Mister Spock, why don't you join us common humanoids in trying to find a way out of here, and quit explaining why we can't get out of here."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,We have until five o'clock to find that way. Now consider this. What materials were on hand in 1881 that could help us fight the Earps on their own terms?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Scott,showing his gun,"We have these, Captain."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,"No, the Melkots gave us those to execute us. We have to find a way to put the Earps out of action. Is there anything that exists here and now that could help us out of this trap?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Chekov,,All those western Cossacks had were poisonous snakes and cactus plants.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,"Bones, the venom, the plants. Can you make use of them?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Mccoy,,"A tranquilliser. Of course, Jim. I can make a tranquilliser!"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Spock,,I could make a device to deliver it on target.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,"First, Bones, the ingredients you require."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Mccoy,,I know the place to get the proper drugs. I'll need a mortar and a pestle.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,"Chekov, mortar and pestle."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,,McCoy and Chekov leave.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,How do you intend to deliver the tranquilliser on target?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Spock,,I shall need some fusing and cotton wadding.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Kirk,,Cotton wadding. Try the apothecary.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Scott,,Aye. (leaves)
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,street,Spock,,"I shall manufacture the equivalent of an ancient generating canister, more familiarly known as a gas grenade."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,barber/dentist's office,,The sign on the wall says Teeth Pulling By Appointment. There's a man in the chair having a shave.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,barber/dentist's office,Barber,,I'll be about five minutes yet. You could come back.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,barber/dentist's office,Mccoy,,"Well, thank you. Mind if I look around a bit? (checking the bottles) Crude, but very useable."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,barber/dentist's office,Barber,,I wouldn't touch that stuff if I was you.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,barber/dentist's office,Mccoy,,"Oh, you don't have to worry. I know how to handle this. I have an urgent need for a small supply of this drug, too."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,barber/dentist's office,Barber,,That stuff ain't mine. It belongs to him. You'd better ask him.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,barber/dentist's office,Mccoy,,"Oh, so you're the dentist. Well, I'm a physician, and I have a serious emergency. I wonder if you mind if I borrow a small quantity of this."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,barber/dentist's office,Holliday,,You want it now?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,barber/dentist's office,Mccoy,,My name is McCoy. I'm a doctor.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,barber/dentist's office,Holliday,,"That joke is all around town already, McLowery. But my name is still Holliday. Doc Holliday."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,barber/dentist's office,Mccoy,,The emergency is real. I need these things.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,barber/dentist's office,Holliday,,"Your emergency sure is real. Go on, take the stuff. Have some more fun. Take my bag. Only best you be finished before five o'clock."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,barber/dentist's office,Mccoy,,"That is my intention, Doctor."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,barber/dentist's office,Holliday,,"Because at one minute past five, you'll find a hole in your head. Right from this gun."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,barber/dentist's office,,A sawn-off shotgun. McCoy leaves with the bag and bottles.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Sylvia,,Ahem.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Chekov,,Sylvia! Hello.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Sylvia,,"Billy Claiborne, you know how crazy I am about you."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Chekov,,That's very nice.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Sylvia,,"Well, aren't you going to ask me what I've got in my shopping bag?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Chekov,,That's just what I was preparing to inquire. Have you been shopping?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Sylvia,,"Of course, silly! What else would I be doing on a beautiful afternoon with the dance only one week away? Or have you forgotten that already?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Chekov,,"No, no, I haven't forgotten. I am looking forward to it most eagerly."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Sylvia,,"You will be absolutely wild when you see me in the new gown I'm going to make. I found this most scrumptious material, yards and yards of it. You know what I was thinking, Billy? I was thinking what a beautiful wedding gown it would make. Why don't we just turn that dance into a wedding ball? It would be so heavenly."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Chekov,,Married? I'm afraid that wouldn't be possible.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Sylvia,,But I'm positive the gown will be ready. What else is there to stop a wedding?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Chekov,,But it is absolutely impossible. I am not someone you can marry. If only I could make clear to you what I really am.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Sylvia,,"Do you think I don't know? Billy Claiborne, you are a cattle rustler and a horse thief and I don't care what else."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Morgan,,"I warned you, Claiborne. Stay away."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,,"Morgan punches Chekov, knocking him down.",
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Morgan,,"You don't have to take anything from that scum, not while I'm here."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Chekov,,Mister Earp. Get your hands off her.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,,"Chekov walks towards Morgan, and gets shot. Kirk and Spock hear Sylvia's scream and arrive on the scene the same time as McCoy, followed by Scott. Wyatt and Holliday also turn up.",
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Mccoy,,"There's nothing I can do, Jim."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Wyatt,,"Come on, Clanton. Let's do it now."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Scott,,"Captain, let me."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Kirk,,No.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Holliday,,"Yeah, come on, Captain. Let him."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Scott,,"Captain, we can't just stand here and take it."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Kirk,,"Yes, we can."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Scott,,But they murdered Chekov! If you think I'm going to
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Kirk,,"Scotty, they're trying to push us into something we're not ready for."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the general store,Spock,,And it is not yet our time.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,,"Spock is working on the grenade, McCoy and Scott on the tranquilliser.",
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,"Let it go, Jim. He's dead."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,Maybe he wouldn't be if I hadn't ignored the Melkot warning.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,We all knew the risk when we joined the service. Now let it go.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,"Gentlemen, there is one thing which requires the immediate attention of all of us. Specifically, our future."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"But not this minute, Spock. It takes us a little longer."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,"I understand the feeling, Captain."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,"You talk about another man's feelings. What do you feel, Spock?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,"My feelings are not a subject for discussion, Doctor."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,Because there are no feelings to discuss.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Scott,,"Mister Spock, Chekov is dead! I say it now, and I can hardly believe it. But you worked closely with him. That deserves some memorial."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,"Spock will have no truck with grief, Scotty. It's human."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"Bones, Scotty."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,"Captain, it's quite all right. They forget I am half human."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,,The clock strikes four.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,We don't have much time.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,"Captain. I vaguely remember the historical account of the famous battle in which we are about to engage, but I am confused."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,About what?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,"Since each of us represents members of the Clanton gang. You, Ike Clanton, I, Frank McLowery, then Mister Chekov would be the other Billy, would he not?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"William Claiborne, that's right."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,But did not William Claiborne survive the battle at the OK Corral?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,"Get to the point, Spock."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,"Mister Chekov is dead. But in the actual gunfight, William Claiborne survived."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"Yes. Yes, that's right. That means it doesn't have to happen the way it happened. We can change it. Bones, how's the tranquilliser coming?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,I'll have it ready before Spock.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,Spock?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,Another hour.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,And we'll have a tranquilliser grenade?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,Not precisely.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,Forget precision. Will it work?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,It should.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"Make sure it does, Spock. If we don't tranquillise them, we'll have to fight them."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,"And if we fight them, we all die. We know that."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,"Negotiating with them could buy us more time, Captain."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"But not with the Earps. I've tried that. That's out. There must be a way. History has been changed in the fact that Billy Claiborne didn't die, but Chekov is lying there dead. That means there must be a way to change this history."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,"It would be worth a try, at least until we're certain of the device. Then perhaps we could quiet things down."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,Not with the Earps. There is one other place I can try.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the sheriff's office,Behan,,You looking for somebody?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the sheriff's office,Kirk,,"Yes, Sheriff. I want you to stop the fight."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the sheriff's office,Behan,,Stop it? Who wants to stop it? I sure don't. You don't. You didn't yesterday.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the sheriff's office,Kirk,,I do now.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the sheriff's office,Behan,,Since when does a Clanton run crawling to the law for help?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the sheriff's office,Kirk,,How else is he going to get justice?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the sheriff's office,Behan,indicating gun,From this. You and your boys set up this whole thing to take care of the Earps. It's a little late to decide you don't have the belly for it.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the sheriff's office,Kirk,,It's not too late. Sheriff. Sheriff. There must be plenty of decent people in town who don't like the Earps. Let's organise them.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the sheriff's office,Behan,,Don't talk nonsense. The people in this town are counting on you to get rid of the Earps for them.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the sheriff's office,Kirk,,Then the people had better wake up and let the law work for them.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the sheriff's office,Behan,,You can talk that way after what the Earps did to Billy today? Nobody in this town will deny you your right to your revenge.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the sheriff's office,Kirk,,"Yes, I want revenge. I want to crush the life out of the Earps. But I can't just kill them."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the sheriff's office,Behan,,"You listen to me. Get down to the OK Corral. Keep out of sight. When the Earps come looking, you bushwhack them."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the sheriff's office,Kirk,,Can't I get it through your stupid head? I can't just kill them! I can't murder them!
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the sheriff's office,Behan,,It's the only way.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the sheriff's office,Kirk,,I can't kill them! I can't kill them!
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,outside the sheriff's office,Behan,,Kill them any way you can! There'll be no questions asked. Honest. I guarantee that!
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,These crude supplies we were forced to use worked quite well.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,I doubt that this combination of things was ever used for any purpose quite like this.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,"Perhaps they would've been if they'd had your ingenuity, Doctor."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,,Kirk enters.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,Captain?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,How soon will that be ready?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,Right now.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,Good. How long will it take the tranquilliser to have effect?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,Three or four seconds.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,How did you manage to test it?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,It has not been tested.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,"It's not necessary, Captain. It's very simple. Nothing can go wrong."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"Up to now, everything has gone wrong. I want it tested now."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Scott,,Would a volunteer solve the problem?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,It would.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Scott,,All right. On one condition. That I'm wide awake and with you at five o'clock.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,Guaranteed.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Scott,,Aye. (has a slug of whiskey) It's to kill the pain.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,But this is painless.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Scott,,"Well, you should've warned me sooner, Mister Spock. Fire away."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,,"Spock pulls the thread on the can, and gas comes out. Scott stands close to it. Then he picks it up so the gas obscures his face.",
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,"It should have worked. Did you inhale the gas, Scotty?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Scott,,Aye. Deeply.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,You still feel all right?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Scott,,I never felt better.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,No dizziness? No sweating? No palpitations?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,It doesn't work.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,Fascinating.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,It was our last chance.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Spock,,"Captain, you don't seem to understand. It did not function, but it must function."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,"Nothing could go wrong, Captain. It should work."

56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,We need a weapon. An answer.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Mccoy,,"You don't have to worry about that now, Jim. Look at the clock."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,saloon,Kirk,,"Ten minutes and it's all going to end at the OK Corral. Well, we're going to wait right here until well after five o'clock. We're not going to move from this spot."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,,"Famous last words, Captain.",
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Kirk,,Let's get out of here.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,,But there is a forcefield to stop them.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Kirk,,"Scotty, Bones. (and it's all the way around.) We're trapped. They got their way. We've got to stand and fight."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Scott,,"Good. If they want a fight, let's gie'em a fight."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Kirk,,They're experts at gunfighting. We don't have a chance.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Mccoy,,"Then we'd better become experts, and fast."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Spock,,That may not be necessary.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Kirk,,"Spock, you've got something?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Spock,,"A fact, Captain. Physical laws simply cannot be ignored. Existence cannot be without them."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Mccoy,,"What do you mean, Spock?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Spock,,"I mean, Doctor, that we are faced with a staggering contradiction. The tranquilliser you created should have been effective."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Kirk,,It would've been effective anywhere else.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Spock,,"Exactly. Doctor, in your opinion, what killed Mister Chekov?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Mccoy,,A piece of lead in his body.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Spock,,Wrong. His mind killed him.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Mccoy,,"Come on, Spock. If you've got the answer, tell us."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Spock,,"Physical reality is consistent with universal laws. Where the laws do not operate, there is no reality. All of this is unreal."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Mccoy,,What do you mean unreal? I examined Chekov. He's dead.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Spock,,"But you made your examination under conditions which we cannot trust. We judge reality by the response of our senses. Once we are convinced of the reality of a given situation, we abide by its rules. We judged the bullets to be solid, the guns to be real, therefore they can kill."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Kirk,,Chekov is dead because he believed the bullets would kill him.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Spock,,He may indeed be dead. We do not know.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Kirk,,"But we do know that the Melkotians created the situation. If we do not allow ourselves to believe that the bullets are real, they cannot kill us."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Spock,,"Exactly. I know the bullets are unreal, therefore they cannot harm me."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Kirk,,"We must all be as certain as you are, Mister Spock, to save our lives."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Spock,,Precisely.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Mccoy,,But that's not possible. There'd always be some doubt.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Spock,,The smallest doubt would be enough to kill you.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Mccoy,,"We're just human beings, Spock. We don't have that clockwork ticker in our head like you do. We can't turn it on and off."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Kirk,,"We must. Spock, a Vulcan mind meld."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Spock,,"Very well, sir. Engineer?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,,The clock strikes five. Wyatt Earp puts on his gun belt.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Spock,,Your mind to my mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,,The marshalls gather as the lightning flashes and the wind blows.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Spock,to McCoy,"The bullets are unreal. Without body. They are illusions only. Shadows without substance. They will not pass through your body, for they do not exist."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Mccoy,,They do not exist.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,,Holliday joins the Earps.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Narrator,,SPOCK (to Kirk) Unreal. Appearances only. They are shadows. Illusions. Nothing but ghosts of reality. They are lies. Falsehoods. Spectres without body. They are to be ignored.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,,The melds have been completed when the four killers arrive at the Corral.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Spock,,Captain.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,Wyatt,,Draw.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,ok corral,,"Kirk reaches for his gun, and the Earps fire. We see the bullets splintering the wood behind the landing party. The Earps empty their guns, then Kirk engages Wyatt in good old-fashioned fisticuffs. He beats him but chooses not to shoot him. Everything disappears.",
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,,McCoy is examining Chekov at his station.,
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Chekov,,"Captain, I don't understand."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Mccoy,,Neither do I. He's in perfect health.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Chekov,,What happened? Where have I been?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,"Right here, it seems."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Chekov,,But that girl. She was so beautiful. So real.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,Do you remember anything else?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Chekov,,No.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,Good. Perhaps that explains why he's here. Nothing was real to him except the girl.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, the Melkotian object."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,Sensor readings.

56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Uhura,,"No damage, sir. All decks report fully operational."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Melkot,,Captain Kirk. You did not kill. Is this the way of your kind?
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,It is. We fight only when there's no choice. We prefer the ways of peaceful contact. I speak for a vast alliance of fellow creatures who believe in the same thing. We have sought you out to join us. Our mission is still one of peace.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Melkot,,Approach our planet and be welcome. A delegation will come out to meet you. Our warning threats are over.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,"Excellent. Lieutenant, cancel Red Alert. Mister Chekov, resume original course, warp factor two."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Chekov,,"Warp factor two, sir."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Spock,,Captain. May I ask a question? You needn't answer if it seems too personal.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,"I'm sure I'll be able to give you an answer, Mister Spock."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Spock,,"This afternoon, you wanted to kill, didn't you?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Mccoy,,"But he didn't kill, Mister Spock."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Spock,,"But he wanted to, Doctor."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,"Is that the way it seemed to you, Mister Spock?"
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Spock,,"Yes, Captain."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, you're absolutely right. That's exactly the way it was."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Spock,,"Mankind, ready to kill."
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Kirk,,That's the way it was in 1881.
56,3,Spectre Of The Gun,bridge,Spock,,I wonder how humanity managed to survive.

57,3,Elaan of Troyius,,Captain'S Log,,"Stardate 4372.5. On a top-secret diplomatic mission, the Enterprise has entered the Tellun star system. Maintaining communications blackout, we have taken aboard Petri, Ambassador from Troyius, the outer planet, and are now approaching the inner planet Elas."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Kirk,,Some desk-bound Starfleet bureaucrat cut these cloak-and-dagger orders.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Scott,,"Aye, but why the secrecy? This star system's under Federation control."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Spock,,"It's in a border area, Mister Scott. The Klingons also claim jurisdiction."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Scott,,"From what I've seen, it's not worth fighting about. Why are we here, Captain?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Kirk,,My orders are to co-operate with Ambassador Petri in all matters pertaining to his mission here.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Uhura,,Bridge to Captain Kirk.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Kirk,,Scotty. (Scott presses the intercom button) Kirk here. What is it?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Uhura,,"Captain, I have a signal from the Elasians. They're ready to beam aboard, and they demand an explanation for the delay."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Kirk,,Demand? What delay? All right. Beam them aboard.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Spock,,Sounds typical of the Elasians. The scientists who made the initial investigation reported the men were vicious and arrogant.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Mccoy,,"That's just the negative part, Mister Spock. I've been over those records. Now the women, they're supposed to be something very special. They're supposed to have a kind of subtle, mystical power that drives men wild."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,,The Ambassador is a skinny humanoid with orange hair and grass green skin.,
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Kirk,,"Ambassador Petri, would you drop all this nonsense and tell me what this is about?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Petri,,That must wait until the Dohlman is aboard.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Kirk,,Dohlman? What the devil is a Dohlman?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,transporter room,Petri,,The thing most feared and hated by my people. Our most deadly enemy.

57,3,Elaan of Troyius,transporter room,Kirk,,I'm Captain Kirk. This ship is under my command.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,transporter room,Kryton,,There's a Troyian here. I must know that all is secure before the Dohlman is brought on board.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,transporter room,Kirk,,This ship is secure and we're prepared for any hostile acts. Energise.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,transporter room,,The Elasians get down on one knee.,
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,transporter room,Kryton,,Do honour to the Dohlman of Elas.

57,3,Elaan of Troyius,transporter room,Kirk,,"Well, now, just a moment. There's going to have to be some kind of understanding."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,transporter room,Petri,,Please.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,transporter room,Kirk,,"My first officer Mister Spock will show you to your quarters. Ambassador, I'd like to speak to you."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,transporter room,Elaan,,You have not been dismissed.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,transporter room,Kirk,,May I have your permission to go?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,transporter room,Elaan,,You are now dismissed.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,transporter room,Kirk,,"Why, thank you. Ambassador."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Kirk,,"Ambassador, I think it's time you told me what's going on."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Petri,,"That creature, Elaan, is to be the wife of our ruler to bring peace. Our two warring planets now possess the capability of mutual destruction. Some method of co-existence must be found."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Kirk,,"I see. So, we go back to Troyius."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Petri,,"Yes. But slowly, Captain. I will need time. Before we reach there, she must be taught civilised manners. In her present condition, my people would never accept her."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Kirk,,And you are to be her teacher?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Petri,,"Those are my orders. I must ask you and your crew to respect, or at least tolerate, their arrogance. Friction must be kept at a minimum."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Kirk,,"Yes, that I can understand."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Petri,,"Another thing you should understand, Captain. You have as much at stake as I have. Your superiors made the statement that failure of this mission would be as catastrophic for Federation planning as it would be for our two planets. To gain peace at the price of accepting such a queen is no victory. I will take her the official gifts I bear. Perhaps that will soften her mood."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov, lay in a course for Troyius. Mister Sulu, impulse drive, speed factor point zero three seven."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Sulu,,"Impulse drive, Captain?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, that's correct, Mister Sulu. Sublight factor point zero three seven."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, aye, sir."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Scott,,Captain? You'll not be using the warp drive? All the way on impulse? That'll take a great deal of time.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"You in a hurry, Mister Scott?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Scott,,No.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,,Spock enters.,
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, the Dohlman is dissatisfied with the quarters provided."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Uhura,,"What's the matter with them, Mister Spock?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Spock,,"I do not know, but all the Elasians seem most irrational."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Uhura,,I gave up my quarters because I
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, I appreciate your sacrifice, Lieutenant Uhura. I'll talk to her myself."

57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,"I do not find them so, and I find him even less satisfactory. Must my bitterness be compounded with that ridiculous ambassador aboard your ship?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Petri,,I explained to Her Glory that her council of nobles and the Troyius Tribunal jointly agreed that I should instruct (pause) make her acquainted with the customs and manners of our people.

57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"There are no more available, but if that's the only way you can get gratification, I'll arrange to have the whole room filled from floor to ceiling with breakable objects."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,I will not be humiliated!
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,Then act in a civilised fashion.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,I did not give you permission to leave!
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,I didn't ask for any.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Petri,,"Captain, I wish to contact my government. I cannot fulfil my mission. It would be an insult to our ruler to bring this incorrigible monster as a bride!"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Kirk,,Ambassador! This is supposed to be a peaceful mission.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Petri,,"There cannot be peace between us. We have deluded ourselves. Captain, when I am near them, I do not want peace. I want to kill them."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Kirk,,You're as bad as she is. It's not required that you like each other. Just do your job.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Petri,,Job? The job is impossible. We cannot make peace with people we detest.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Kirk,,Stop trying to kill each other. Then worry about being friendly.

57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Elaan,,"We are interested in how the ship is used in combat, not in what drives it. Engines are for mechanics and menials."

57,3,Elaan of Troyius,sickbay,Uhura,,"Captain Kirk. May I speak with you, sir?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,sickbay,Kirk,,Yes. Certainly.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,sickbay,Uhura,,A message just came from Starfleet Command. It was class-A security and scrambled. I put it through the decoder.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,sickbay,Kirk,,What was it?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,sickbay,Uhura,,The Federation High Commissioner is on his way to Troyius to attend the royal wedding.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,sickbay,Chapel,,"Ambassador, if Elasian women are that vicious, why are men so overwhelmingly attracted to them? I mean, what magic do they possess?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,sickbay,Petri,,It's not magic. It's biochemical. A man whose flesh is once touched by the tears of a woman of Elas has his heart enslaved forever.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,sickbay,Kirk,,"Ambassador, there's an added complication. The Federation High Commissioner will be attending the wedding."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,sickbay,Mccoy,,The fat will be in the fire when he learns the bride just tried to murder the groom's ambassador.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,sickbay,Petri,,"There will be no wedding. I would not have our ruler marry that monster if the entire galaxy depended on it, and I will have nothing further to do with you."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,sickbay,Kirk,,I'm not asking you to have anything to do with me. Do your job with her. How long before he's on his feet?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,sickbay,Mccoy,,"It'll be a few days. A week, at least, Jim."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,sickbay,Petri,,"Here you put me, Captain. Here I will stay. I have nothing further to say to you."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,,"She is dining like a Tudor royal, ripping poultry apart with her hands.",
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,"So, Ambassador Petri is going to recover? That is too bad. You have delivered your message. Now you may go."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"Nothing would please me more, Your Glory. But your impetuous nature"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,"Your Troyian pig was here in my quarters without any permission, so I stabbed him. Just to be Troyian is enough."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,You Elasians pride yourselves on being a warrior people. You must understand discipline to be able to give and take orders. My orders are to take you to Troyius to be married and to see that you learn Troyian customs.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,I despise Troyians. Any contact with them makes me feel soiled.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,It's been my experience that the prejudices people feel about each other disappear when they get to know each other.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,It's not in my experience.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"Well, we're still faced with the same problem."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,Problem?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"Yes, the problem of your indoctrination to Troyian customs and manners."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,I have eliminated that problem.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,You have eliminated the teacher. The problem still remains.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,Oh. And how do we solve the problem?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,By giving you a new teacher.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,"Tell me, what can you teach me?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"Table manners, for one thing. This is a plate. It contains food. This is a knife. It cuts the food. This is a glass."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,Leave me!
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"Like it or not, you're going to learn what you've been ordered to learn."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,You will return me to Elas immediately.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,That's impossible.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,Everything I order is possible.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,That's the first problem we're going to work on. Then we'll get you ready to go to Troyius.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,"I will not go to Troyius, I will not be mated to a Troyian, and I will not be humiliated, and I will not be given to a green pig as a bribe to stop a war!"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"You enjoy the privileges and prerogatives of being a Dohlman. Then be worthy of them. If you don't want the obligations that go along with the title, then give it up."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,Nobody speaks to me that way.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"That's another one of your problems. Nobody's told you that you're an uncivilized savage, a vicious child in a woman's body, an arrogant monster!"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,,"Elaan slaps Kirk, so he slaps her back.",
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,That's no way to treat someone who's telling you the truth.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,,"He turns to leave, she takes a knife from her sleeve and throws it. It just misses him and sticks in the wall.",
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,Tomorrow's lesson will be on courtesy.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant, open up the hailing frequency, identify us, and ask the Klingon his intentions."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,,"Meanwhile, Kryton is sneaking around in Engineering, and messing with the dilithium crystals.",
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, no response from the Klingon vessel on any channel."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"I see. All right, Lieutenant. Monitor all frequencies. Phaser crews stand by. Maintain Yellow Alert."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Watson,,What are you doing?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,,"Kryton kills the red-shirt and hides his body, then continues with his sabotage.",
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,,Kirk is prevented from entering Elaan's quarters.,
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Elasian,,No one may enter the Dohlman's presence.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Kirk,,Where's Kryton?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Elasian,,On business. No one may enter the Dohlman's presence.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Kirk,,Will you tell Her Glory that Captain Kirk requests the honour of a visit.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Elasian,,The Dohlman has promised I'll be whipped to death if I let Captain Kirk pass through that door.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,,"They push Kirk away, so Spock stuns them with a phaser.",
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Kirk,,"Thank you, Mister Spock. When they wake up, take them to Security holding."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Spock,,"Captain, your analysis of the situation was flawless, anticipating that she would deny you admittance. However, the logic by which you arrived at your conclusion escapes me."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, the women on your planet are logical. That's the only planet in this galaxy that can make that claim."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,,"Elaan takes another swing at Kirk, so he forces her back down onto the bed.",
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,You dare touch a member of the royal family.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"Only in self-defence. Now, are you going to behave or not?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,The penalty is death for what you are doing.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,We're not on Elas. We're on my starship. I command here.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,,She bites his hand and runs into the bathroom.,
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,"You are warned, Captain, never to touch me again."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"If I touch you again, Your Glory, it'll be to administer an ancient Earth custom called a spanking, a form of punishment administered to spoiled brats."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,You have my leave to go.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"You forget, Your Glory, we haven't started your lesson in courtesy."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,"You can teach me nothing, Captain. If I have to stay here for ten light years, I will not be soiled by any contact with you."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"Very well. I'll send in Mister Spock or Doctor McCoy. Either way, you're going to be properly prepared for Troyius. As ordered by councils, rulers, and bureaucrats."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,,She comes back out.,
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,"Captain, there is one thing you can teach me."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"No, no, you were right the first time. There's nothing I can teach you. There's nothing you do not know."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,I don't know how to make people like me. I don't want everybody to hate me.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"Well, it's not it's not that people hate you. It's just that people don't like to be treated as though they don't exist."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,,He wipes a tear from her face.,
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"It's, er, gotten very, er. Something must've gone wrong with the ventilation system."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,Captain?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"Pardon me, Your Glory. There will be a short recess."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,Captain.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,,They kiss.,
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,"Captain, that ancient Earth custom called spanking, what is it?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"It's, er, It's, er. We'll talk about it later."

57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,Kirk here.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Uhura,,"Oh, Captain, I'm picking up a transmission from inside the Enterprise. It's on a tight beam aimed at the Klingon vessel."

57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,Inside the Enterprise? Can you pinpoint it?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Spock,,"Spock here, Captain. I am triangulating now. It's coming from the engineering section."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,Security to Engineering. Intruder alert. Security alert to all decks. Kirk out.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,,He leaves Elaan on the bed with a smug smile on her face.,
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,,Kryton has been caught.,
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Scott,,"Nobody saw him, but that devil sneaked back in here some way. Watson must've caught him and he was killed for it. He had this. Looks like some sort of transmitter."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Kirk,,It's Klingon. Bones?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Mccoy,,Neck snapped clean.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Kirk,,What kind of signal did you send the Klingon ship?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Kryton,,"Captain, you must know I will tell you nothing. Our interrogation techniques are more excruciating than you are even capable of."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Kirk,,"Yes, I'm aware you're trained to resist any form of physical torture. Kirk to Spock."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Spock,,"Spock here, Captain."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, it was Kryton transmitting. He refuses to talk. I'll need you for the Vulcan mind meld."

57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Kirk,,"What was he trying to cover that was so important he felt he had to die for it? Scotty, he didn't come into Engineering just to use the transmitter. I want you to check every relay you've got."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Scott,,"Captain, you must realise the time"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Kirk,,Don't waste the time telling me about it. Get to it.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Scott,,Aye.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,Kryton was of a noble family. He loved me and wanted to marry me. He was furious when he heard of the announcement of the wedding plans.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,He sold out to the Klingons because of jealousy?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,Probably. But why speak of unimportant matters when we can speak about us?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,There's a Klingon warship out there. What's their involvement? Surely all of this isn't because they want to stop a marriage.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,We should welcome their help.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"Elaan. Elaan, two planets, an entire star system's stability depends on it. We have a duty to forget what happened."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,Could you do that? Could you give me to another man?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,"My orders and yours say that you belong to another man. What happened, what happened was an accident."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,"It was no accident. I chose you, and you chose me. I have a plan. With this ship, you could completely obliterate Troyius. Then there will be no need for the marriage. And in gratitude, my people will give you the complete rule of this system."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Kirk,,What kind of a mind could think of such a thing?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,elaan's quarters,Elaan,,He's a Troyian.

57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Spock,,"Captain, are you all right?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Mccoy,,"Did she cry, Jim?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Kirk,,What?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Mccoy,,Did she cry? Did her tears touch you at any time?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,,Kirk looks at his hand.,
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Mccoy,,"Oh, we're in trouble. Now listen, Jim. Petri told Christine that the Elasian women have a sort of a biochemical substance in their tears that acts like a super love potion. And according to him, it doesn't wear off."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Spock,,"It is true then, Captain?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Kirk,,"It's true. Bones, you've got to find me an antidote."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Mccoy,,"I'll try, but I'll need tests and"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Sulu,,Bridge to Captain.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Kirk,,Captain here.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Sulu,,"Captain, the Klingon ship has changed course. It is heading toward us at warp speed."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,corridor,Kirk,,I'm on my way. Battle stations.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,Phasers stand by.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Sulu,,"Phasers ready, sir."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Spock,,"Their speed is better than warp six, Captain."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov, lay in a course to take us out of this star system. If they want to fight, Let's get some manoeuvering room."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Chekov,,"Course computed, sir."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Sulu,,"Laid in, Captain."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,All right. Ahead warp factor two.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Scott,,"Captain, the matter-antimatter"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Belay that order. What is it, Scotty?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Scott,,The anti-matter pods are rigged to blow up the moment we go into warp drive.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Scotty, that bomb he planted. Can you dismantle it?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Scott,,Not without being blown halfway across the galaxy.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Give us every ounce of power you can from the impulse drive, and find a solution to the bomb. Kirk out. Mister Sulu, stand by to make your manoeuvres smartly. She'll be sluggish on response."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,,Elaan enters the bridge. Kirk sees her during Sulu's countdown.,
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, sir. One hundred thousand kilometres. Ninety. Eighty."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Phaser crews, stand by to fire on command."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Sulu,,Sixty.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,Ready.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Sulu,,Fifty.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,Hold your fire.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Sulu,,She's passed us without firing a shot.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Spock,,I don't think they meant to attack us. We were very fortunate this time.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, their tactics are quite clear now, Mister Spock. They were trying to make us cut in warp drive. That way we'd have blown ourselves up and solved their problem for them without risking war with the Federation. Very neat."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Spock,,Very. But why do the Klingons consider the possession of this system so vital?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, a very good question, Mister Spock."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Spock,,"I have another question, Captain. Is not the bridge the wrong place for the Dohlman at a time like this?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"I'll be the judge. Yes, you're quite right. Thank you, Mister Spock. (to Elaan) I want you to go to Sickbay. It's the best protected part of the ship."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Elaan,,I want to be by your side.

57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Elaan,,"I love you. I have chosen you, and still I don't understand why you didn't fight the Klingon."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Kirk,,"If I can accomplish my mission by turning tail and running, I'll gladly do that."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Elaan,,And that mission is to take me to Troyius.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Kirk,,Yes.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Elaan,,Would you have me wearing my wedding dress for another man and never see you again?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Kirk,,"Yes, Elaan."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Elaan,,Are you happy at the prospect?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Kirk,,No.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Scott,,Scott to Captain.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Kirk,,Kirk here.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Scott,,"I've got bad news, Captain. The entire dilithium crystal converter assembly is fused. No chance of repair."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Scott,,It's completely unusable.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Kirk,,No chance of restoring warp drive?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Scott,,Not without dilithium crystals. We can't even generate enough power to fire our weapons.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Kirk,,"Kirk out. Elaan, I have to go back to the Bridge. Please, you must go to Sickbay."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,turbolift,Elaan,,"Yes, my love."

57,3,Elaan of Troyius,medical lab,Mccoy,,Results also negative.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,medical lab,Petri,,"Doctor, there is no antidote to the poison of Elasian tears. The men of Elas have tried desperately for centuries to dispel its power. You're wasting your time, Doctor."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,medical lab,Mccoy,,"It is my time to waste, Ambassador."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,medical lab,Elaan,,Doctor? The Captain asked me to come here for safety.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,medical lab,Petri,,"Safety? What is your estimate of our chances for survival, Doctor?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,medical lab,Mccoy,,"That is the captain's responsibility, Ambassador."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, message from the Klingon ship. They're ordering us to stand by for boarding or be destroyed."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Spock,,They demand an immediate reply.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"They're trying to force a fight. Scotty, what's our energy status?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Scott,,"Ninety three percent of impulse power, sir."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Spock,,We can still manoeuvre.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Scott,,Manoeuvre? Aye. We can wallow like a garbage scow against a warp-driven starship.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Scott,,"Our shields will hold for a few passes, but without the matter-antimatter reactor, we've no chance. Captain, can you not call Starfleet on this emergency?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,And let the Klingons know they succeeded in wiping out our warp engines?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Spock,,Help could not arrive before the Enterprise would be destroyed.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,medical lab,Petri,,"Now that we are all about to die, I ask you once again to accept this necklace, and to wear it as a token of respect for the desperate wishes of your people and mine for peace."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,medical lab,Elaan,,"That's all you men of other worlds can speak of, duty and responsibility."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"We'll stall for time, proceed on course and hope the Klingons can be bluffed. Or that they're not prepared for a general war. Open a hailing frequency."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Uhura,,"Frequency open, sir."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise on Federation business. Our mission is peaceful, but we're not prepared to accept any interference."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Klingon,,"Enterprise, prepare to be boarded or destroyed."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,I'd say our strategy wasn't totally effective.

57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Hard over, Sulu. Bring her around. He's going for our flank. (another disruptor hit) Sulu!"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Sulu,,"Sorry, Captain. She won't respond fast enough on impulse."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Spock,,He's past us again. Damage to number four shield.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,How bad?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Spock,,"It will not withstand another full charge, Captain. I'm getting some very peculiar energy readings."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Sulu,,He's paralleling us again. He seems to have broken off the attack.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"What sort of readings, Mister Spock?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Spock,,She is the source.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,Elaan?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Spock,,The necklace.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,What kind of jewels are in this?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Elaan,,They call them radans. The necklace is supposed to bring you luck. It is of little value. They are common stones.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Spock,,"These are common stones? (scans them) See, Captain? Here and here."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,Common stones? Now I see why the Klingons are interested in this system. May I have this?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Elaan,,"If I can be of any help, of course."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"You may have just saved our lives. Mister Spock, do you think Scotty could make use of dilithium crystals?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Spock,,"No doubt, Captain."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Sulu,,"He's coming in again, sir."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Sulu, prepare on my order to turn quickly to port. Try and protect the number four shield."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, sir."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Now, Sulu. hard a-port!"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,,Another disrupter hit,

57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Uhura,,Captain. Message coming in.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Klingon,,"Enterprise, our readings confirm your power extremely low, your shields buckling. This is your last chance to surrender."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, number four shield just collapsed. Impulse power down to thirty one percent."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant Uhura, open a hailing frequency."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Uhura,,"Channel open, sir."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,This is Captain James Kirk of the United Spaceship Enterprise. May I request your terms for surrender?
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Klingon,,No terms. Surrender must be unconditional and immediate.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Scotty, your estimate."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Scott,,"We're fitting it now, sir, but we'll have to run a few tests to make sure."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,Test it in combat.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,engineering,Spock,,"Captain, these are crude crystals. There is no way to judge what the unusual shapes will do to the energy flow."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, that could blow us up just as effectively as"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,Let me know when it's in place. Open a hailing frequency.
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Uhura,,"Hailing frequency open, sir."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"This is the Enterprise. Will you guarantee the safety of our passenger, the Dohlman from Elas?"
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Klingon,,No conditions. Surrender immediately.

57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Negative. His sensors will pick up our power increase. The more helpless he thinks we are, the closer he'll come. As he passes, I want to cut in warp drive. We'll pivot at warp two and bring all tubes to bear."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, sir."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov, give him a full spread of photon torpedoes."

57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Mccoy,,Are you out of your Vulcan mind? Do you know how long I've worked on
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Spock,,"The antidote to a woman of Elas, Doctor, is a starship. The Enterprise infected the Captain long before the Dohlman did."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Sulu, prepare to take us out of orbit."
57,3,Elaan of Troyius,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, I doubt seriously if there's any kind of an antidote for the Enterprise."

58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Mccoy,,I swear that's honeysuckle I smell.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Kirk,,I swear that's a little orange blossom thrown in. It's unbelievable. Growth exactly like that of Earth on a planet half a galaxy away. What are the odds on such duplication?
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Spock,,"Astronomical, Captain. The relative size, age and composition of this planet makes it highly improbable that it would evolve similarly to Earth in any way."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Mccoy,,What in blazes is that?

58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Kirk,,Any theories about what it is?
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Spock,,"Negative, Captain. Structures of this complexity require extremely sophisticated building apparatus, the kind usually found in cultures surpassing or equalling our own."

58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Kirk,,And how much time did you say we have to investigate?
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Spock,,"If we are to divert the asteroid which is on a collision course with this planet, we must warp out of orbit within thirty minutes. Every second we delay arriving at the deflection point compounds the problem, perhaps past solution."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Kirk,,You did say thirty minutes?
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Spock,,"Yes, sir."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Kirk,,Then let's go. Let's find out what life forms are blessed by this environment.

58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Why, they look like. I'd swear they're American Indians."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Spock,,"They are, Doctor. A mixture of Navajo, Mohican, and Delaware, I believe. All among the more advanced and peaceful tribes."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Kirk,,"It's like discovering Atlantis or Shangri-la. Mister Spock, is it possible there's a more evolved civilisation somewhere else on this planet, one capable of building that obelisk or developing a deflector system?"
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Spock,,"Highly improbable, Captain. Sensor probes indicate only one type of life form here."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Shouldn't we contact them, Jim? Tell them?"
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Kirk,,Tell them what? That an asteroid's coming to smash their world into atoms?
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Spock,,"Too primitive to grasp the concept of space flight, Doctor. Our appearance here would only confuse and frighten them."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Kirk,,We've got a job to do. Let's get back to the Enterprise.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,,Along the path.,
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Mccoy,,"What's the matter, Jim?"
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Kirk,,"What? Oh, nothing. It's just so peaceful, uncomplicated. No problems, no command decisions. Just living."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Typical human reaction to an idyllic natural setting. Back in the twentieth century, we referred to it as the Tahiti Syndrome. It's particularly common to over-pressured leader types, like starship captains."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,planet surface,Kirk,,"Ah, the Tahiti Syndrome. Let's go take care of that asteroid. But first I want another look at that obelisk."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,,Kirk walks up to it as McCoy scans with the tricorder.,
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Spock,,Doctor?
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Mccoy,,Yes.

58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Spock,,"Doctor, that asteroid is almost as large as your Earth's moon. Far enough away, the angle necessary to divert it enough to avoid destruction is minute, but as the asteroid approaches this planet, the angle becomes so great that even the power of a starship"
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Mccoy,,"The devil with an asteroid! It won't get here for two months, Spock!"
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Spock,,"If we arrive at the deflection point in time, it may not get here at all."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Mccoy,,"In the meantime, what about Jim?"
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Spock,,"Once the asteroid has been diverted, we'll return here and resume the search."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Mccoy,,That may be hours from now. He may be injured or dying.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Spock,picking up two stoned to illustrate his point,"Doctor, assume this is the planet we're on. This is the approaching asteroid. If we don't get to that deflection point in time, it will become physically impossible to divert this asteroid. In that case, everyone on this planet will die, including the captain."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Mccoy,,"Can a few more minutes matter, Spock?"
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Spock,,"In the time it's taken me to explain the problem, the asteroid has moved from here to here. The longer we delay, the less the likelihood of being able to divert it. Beam us up, Mister Scott."

58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Elder,,"Our skies have darkened three times since the harvest. The last time worst of all. Our legend predicts such danger and promises that the Wise Ones who planted us here will send a god to save us, one who can rouse the temple spirit and make the sky grow quiet. Can you do this?"
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Kirk,,"I came from the temple, as Miramanee said, and it was a beginning for me here. But I came from the sky, too. Only I can't remember. I can't remember."

58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Kirk,,"Well, why doesn't Salish use it? Why are the people in danger?"
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Miramanee,,His father did not wish to share his power too soon. He died before he told Salish the secret.

58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Elder,,"Then it must be ourselves, the way we live. Perhaps we have not improved as quickly as the Wise Ones wish."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Kirk,,"Your land is rich, your people happy. Who could be displeased with that?"
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Elder,,But there is something. Tell us. We will change it.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Kirk,,"I can't tell you anything. All I can tell you is that I'm happy and peaceful here. I'm not sure, but I think I've never felt that way before."

We might not be able to save anything, including this ship! You haven't heard a word I've said. All you've been doing is staring at that blasted obelisk."

58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,spock's quarters,Spock,,"I'm aware of that, Doctor. I'm also aware when we arrive at the planet, we'll have barely four hours to effect rescue. I believe those symbols are the key."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,spock's quarters,Mccoy,,"Well, you won't read them by killing yourself. You've hardly eaten or slept for weeks. Now if you don't let up, you're going to collapse."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,spock's quarters,Spock,,"I am not hungry, Doctor. And under stress, we Vulcans can do without sleep for weeks."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,spock's quarters,Mccoy,,"Well, your Vulcan metabolism is so low it can hardly be measured, and as for the pressure, that green ice water you call blood"
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,spock's quarters,Spock,,"My physical condition is not important, Doctor. That obelisk is."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,spock's quarters,Mccoy,,"Well, my diagnosis is exhaustion brought on from overwork and guilt. You're blaming yourself for crippling this ship, just as we blamed you. Well, we were wrong. So were you. You made a command decision. Jim would have done the same. My prescription is rest, now. Do I have to call the security guards to enforce it?"

58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Kirk,,Why?
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Miramanee,,To save them.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Kirk,,But it's only the wind. The wind can't harm them.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Miramanee,,"The wind is only the beginning. Soon the sky will darken, the lake will go wild, and the earth will tremble. Only you can save us."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Kirk,,But I can't do anything about the wind or the sky.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Miramanee,,"If we don't go now, it will be too late. You must go inside the temple and make the blue flame come out."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Kirk,,I don't know how to get inside the temple.

58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Kirk,,We'll go to the caves. It'll be safe there.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Salish,,The caves? Surely a legend can do more than that for his people.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Elder,,"When the ground trembles the caves are not safe, Kirok. If you do not rouse the temple spirit, we will all die."

58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,spock's quarters,Mccoy,,I prescribed sleep.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,spock's quarters,Spock,,"You prescribed rest, Doctor. The symbols on the obelisk are not words. They are musical notes."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,spock's quarters,Mccoy,,Musical notes? You mean it's nothing but a song?
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,spock's quarters,Spock,,"In a way, yes. Other cultures, among them certain Vulcan offshoots, use musical notes as words. The tones correspond roughly to an alphabet."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,spock's quarters,Mccoy,,Were you able to make sense our of the symbols?
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,spock's quarters,Spock,,"Yes. The obelisk is a marker, just as I thought. It was left by a super-race known as the Preservers. They passed through the galaxy rescuing primitive cultures which were in danger of extinction and seeding them, so to speak, where they could live and grow."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,spock's quarters,Mccoy,,I've always wondered why there were so many humanoids scattered through the galaxy.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,spock's quarters,Spock,,So have I. Apparently the Preservers account for a number of them.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,spock's quarters,Mccoy,,That's probably how the planet has survived all these centuries. The Preservers put an asteroid deflector on the planet.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,spock's quarters,Spock,,Which has now become defective and is failing to operate.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,spock's quarters,Mccoy,,"And we have to find that deflector and put it back into working order, otherwise"

58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,All,,"You'll be killed! Kill him! We're all doomed! Die, impostor! You lied to us! You're not a god! We'll kill you now!"
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,,Spock and McCoy beam down as Miramanee and Kirk fall under the hail of stones. The crowd runs away when they see them. McCoy checks Kirk first.,
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Mccoy,,I need Nurse Chapel.

58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,,"Spock rolls Miramanee onto her back, and Chapel gives her an injection.",
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Spock,,The nurse has given you something to ease the pain. Why were you being stoned?
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Miramanee,,Kirok could not get back into the temple.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Spock,,"Naturally, since he did not come from there."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Miramanee,,"I saw him come, come."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Chapel,,Does he recognise us?
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Mccoy,,His brain is unimpaired. Everything else is functionally normally except his memory.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Narrator,,SPOCK:: Can you help him?
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Mccoy,,It'd take time.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Spock,,"Time, Doctor McCoy, is the one thing we do not have in abundance. (communicator beeps) Spock here."

58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Spock,,"Report noted. Doctor, is he strong enough for the Vulcan mind fusion?"
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Mccoy,,We have no choice.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,,So Spock places his hands on Kirk's face and starts the procedure.,
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Spock,,"I am Spock. You are James Kirk. Our minds are moving closer. Closer, closer, closer, James Kirk. Closer."

58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Spock,,His mind. He is an extremely dynamic individual.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Kirk,,It worked.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,,Kirk goes to Miramanee.,
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Spock,,"Captain, were you inside this structure?"
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Kirk,,Yes. What's inside is loaded with scientific equipment.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Spock,,"This obelisk is one huge deflector mechanism. It is imperative that we get inside immediately. Captain, we do not have much time."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Kirk,,McCoy.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,,McCoy and Chapel start tending to Miramanee.,
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Kirk,,I don't know how to get inside.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Spock,,"If we are not able to gain entry and activate the deflector mechanism within the next fifty minutes, this entire planet will be destroyed."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Kirk,,The key must be in these symbols. We've got to decipher them.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Spock,,"I already have to some extent, Captain. They are musical notes."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Kirk,,You mean entry can be gained by playing certain notes on a musical instrument?
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Spock,,That would be one method. Another would be a series of tonal qualities spoken in their proper sequence.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Kirk,,"Give me your communicator. Tonal control, consonants and vowels. I must have hit it accidentally when I contacted the ship."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Spock,,"If you could remember your exact words, Captain."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Kirk,flipping open the communicator,Kirk to Enterprise.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Scott,,"Aye, Captain."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,,"The hatch slides open, with Miramanee still lying on it.",
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk,Kirk,,"Scotty, if the deflector isn't activated within twenty minutes, get out of orbit. Get the Enterprise out of the danger zone. The landing party is expendable. The Enterprise isn't. Kirk out. Miramanee. Bones, stay with her. Do what you can."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk chamber,Spock,,"It is similar to deflector panels I've seen, Captain, but far more complicated."
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk chamber,Kirk,,Careful. I must have hit something accidentally. A beam caught me and that's when I stopped remembering.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk chamber,Spock,,Probably a memory beam. You must have activated it out of sequence.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk chamber,Kirk,,More symbols. Can you read them?
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,obelisk chamber,Spock,,"I do have an excellent eye for musical notes, Captain. They would seem to indicate that this series of relays activated in their proper"

58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Miramanee,,"I knew you would save them, my chief. When I am better, it will be as it was, will it not?"
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Kirk,,If that's what you want.
58,3,The Paradise Syndrome,lodge,Miramanee,,We will live long and happy lives. I will bear you many strong sons. I'll love you always.

59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Spock,,I did give a full report

59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Mccoy,,"I can find no reason for the captain's behaviour, except possibly that we've been on patrol too long without relief and diversion. He has resisted all of my attempts to run a psychological profile on him."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Sulu,,"Maintaining course and speed, sir."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Kirk,,"Change course. Come about to one eight five, mark three."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Sulu,,"But, sir, that'll lead us directly into the Romulan Neutral Zone."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, very perceptive, Mister Sulu. I know where the course change takes us. Execute."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, sir."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Spock,,Increasing sensor scan to one parsec. All scanners report clear. Nothing in our immediate vicinity.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Kirk,,"Better and better, Mister Spock."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, leaving Neutral Zone. Now entering Romulan space."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,,Scott enters the Bridge.,
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Kirk,,"Very well, Mister Sulu."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Scott,,"Lieutenant, when did the order come through?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Uhura,,Order?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Scott,,From Starfleet. The order to enter the Neutral Zone.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Uhura,,"There's been no order I know of, Mister Scott."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Scott,,Surely the Captain couldn't be doing this on his own authority.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Kirk,,"If you two have complaints, you can bring them out into the open."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,,A sinister shape appears on the viewscreen.,
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Scott,,"That's a Klingon ship! But it couldn't be, not in this area."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Spock,,Intelligence reports Romulans now using Klingon design.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Kirk,,Sound Red Alert. Man battle stations. Stand by main phasers.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Uhura,,"Battle stations. All hands, battle stations."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Spock,,"A second ship has appeared. (another one decloaks) Correction, there are now three. We are surrounded."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant Uhura, code a message to Starfleet Command. Advise them of our situation. Include all log entries to this point."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, your sensors read clear. What happened?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Spock,,"I have a theory, Captain."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain Kirk, I'm receiving a class two signal from the Romulan vessel."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Kirk,,"Put it on the main viewing screen, Lieutenant, and complete that message to Starfleet Command."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Tal,a thin male,"You have been identified as the star ship Enterprise, Captain James T. Kirk last known to be in command."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Kirk,,Your information is correct. This is Captain Kirk.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Tal,,"I am Sub-commander Tal of the Romulan fleet. Your ship is surrounded, Captain. You will surrender immediately, or we will destroy you."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant. (mutes sound) They want something, or they would have destroyed us by now."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Spock,,"True, Captain. That would be standard Romulan procedure."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Kirk,,"It's my ship they want, and very badly."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Spock,,It would be a great prize.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant. (sound on) Save your threats. If you board this ship, I'll blow it up. You'll gain nothing."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Tal,,Who is that beside you?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Kirk,,"My first officer, Commander Spock."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Tal,,"Vulcan. (his communicator beeps and he answers it) Yes, Commander. Yes, Commander. No one should decide quickly to die, Captain. We give you one of your hours. If you do not surrender your ship at the end of that time, your destruction is certain. We will be open to communication should you wish it."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Kirk,,You understand that Starfleet Command has been advised of the situation?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Tal,,"The subspace message will take three weeks to reach Starfleet. The decision is yours, Captain. One hour."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Kirk,,"The design of the ship is the same. Mister Spock, you said you had a theory on why your sensors didn't pick up the new ships until they were upon us."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Spock,,I believe the Romulans have developed a cloaking device which renders our tracking sensors useless.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Kirk,,"If so, Romulans could attack in Federation territory before we knew they were there, before a vessel or planet could get even begin to get their defences up."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Scott,,They caught us right enough.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Kirk,,"Well, that's a brilliant observation, Mister Scott. Do you have any other helpful opinions?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Scott,,We've not got many choices.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Kirk,,"We have three. We can fight and be destroyed, or we can destroy the Enterprise ourselves and keep her from the Romulans. Or we can surrender. Opinions, gentlemen."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Scott,,"If the Enterprise is taken by Romulans, they'll know everything there is to know about a starship."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Spock,,"If we had not crossed the Neutral Zone, on your order, you would not now need our opinions to support a decision which should never have had to be made."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Jim, you ordered us? You had no authority!"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Kirk,,"Dismissed, Doctor."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Mccoy,,Jim!
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Kirk,,I said dismissed.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,,McCoy leaves.,
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Uhura,,Bridge to Captain Kirk.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Kirk,,Kirk here.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Uhura,,"The Romulan vessel is signalling again, sir."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Kirk,,Put them on the screen.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Uhura,,"Aye, aye, sir."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Tal,,"My commander wishes to speak with you, Captain Kirk."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Kirk,,Put him on.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Tal,,The commander wishes to see you and your first officer aboard this vessel. It is felt this matter requires discussion.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Kirk,,Why should we walk right into your hands?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Tal,,Two of my officers will beam aboard your vessel as exchange hostages while you are here.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Kirk,,What guarantee do we have they'll beam aboard our ship once we're on yours?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Tal,,"Granted, we do not easily trust each other, Captain, but you are the ones who violated our territory. Should it not be we who distrust your motives? However, we agree to simultaneous exchange."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,briefing room,Kirk,,Give us your transporter co-ordinates. We're beaming aboard.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,transporter room,Kirk,,"One final order, Engineer Scott. If we do not return, the Enterprise must not be taken. If the Romulans attempt it, you're to fight, and if necessary, destroy yourselves. Is that clear?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,transporter room,Scott,,Perfectly clear.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,transporter room,Kirk,,Energise.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,transporter room,,"As Kirk and Spock beam out, two Romulans beam in. Once solid, they draw their weapons. Scott scowls.",
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,,"The figure in the curved chair swivels round to reveal that the Commander is a woman in a uniform that barely covers her bottom, and thigh-length boots.",
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,Captain Kirk.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Kirk,,Commander. I'm honoured.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,"I don't think so, but we have an important matter to discuss. And your superficial courtesies are an overture to that discussion. You are the first officer?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,Spock.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,I speak first with the Captain. You may wait outside.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,,Spock and the two guards leave,
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,"The matter of trespass into Romulan space is one of galactic import, a violation of treaties. Now I ask you simply, what is your mission here?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Kirk,,"Instrument failure caused navigational error. We were across the Neutral Zone before we realised it, then we were surrounded by your ships before we could get back."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,A starship? One of the Starfleet's finest vessels? You're saying instrument failure as radical as you suggest went unnoticed until you were well past the Neutral Zone?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Kirk,,Accidents happen. Cut off back-up systems malfunction. We were due for overhaul two months ago.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,I see. But you were able to navigate with this malfunction?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Kirk,,The error was corrected.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,But I doubt it'll clear you of espionage.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Kirk,,"We were not spying, Commander."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,"Your language has always been most difficult for me, Captain. Perhaps you have another word for it."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Kirk,,You're grossly mistaken if you think we were there
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,"Captain, if a Romulan vessel ventured far into Federation territory without good explanation, what would a starbase commander do? You see, it works both ways. I hardly believe you are the injured party. Spock, come in."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,,Spock and the guards enter.,
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,The captain has made his statement.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,I understand.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,"I must admit some surprise on seeing you, Spock. We were not aware of Vulcans aboard the Enterprise."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,Starfleet is not in the habit of informing Romulans of its ships' personnel.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,"Quite so. Yet there are certain ships, certain officers, that are known to us. Your situation appears most interesting."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Kirk,,What earns Spock your special interest?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,"He is a Vulcan. Our forebears had the same roots and origins. Something you wouldn't understand, Captain. We can appreciate the Vulcans, our distant brothers. I have heard of Vulcan integrity and personal honour. There's a well-known saying, or is it a myth, that Vulcans are incapable of lying?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,It is no myth.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,"Then tell me truthfully now, by your honour as a Vulcan, what was your mission?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,I reserve the privilege of speaking only when it will not violate my honour as a Vulcan.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,It is unworthy of a Vulcan to resort to subterfuge.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,"You're being clever, Commander. That is unworthy of a Romulan. It is not a lie to keep the truth to oneself."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,Then there is a truth here that remains unspoken.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Kirk,,You've been told everything. There's nothing else to say.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,"There is Mister Spock's unspoken truth. You knew of the cloaking device that we have developed. You deliberately violated Romulan space with a blatant spy mission, by order of the Federation."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Kirk,,"We've been all through that, Commander!"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,We have not even begun! There's no force that I can use on a Vulcan that will make him speak. That is a fact. But there are Romulan methods completely effective against humans and human weaknesses.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,"You would not resort to them, Commander. They would prove ineffective against the captain."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,"Then they will leave him dead, or what might be worse than dead. But I will know your unspoken truths."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Kirk,,Let her rant. There's nothing to say.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,I cannot allow the captain to be further destroyed. The strain of command has worn heavily upon him. He's not been himself for several weeks.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Kirk,,That's a lie!
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,"As you can see, Captain Kirk is a highly sensitive and emotional person. I believe he has lost the capacity for rational decision."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Kirk,,"Shut up, Spock!"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,I'm betraying no secrets. The commander's suspicion that Starfleet ordered the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone is unacceptable. Our rapid capture demonstrates its foolhardiness.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Kirk,,You filthy liar!
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,"I am speaking the truth for the benefit of the Enterprise and the Federation. I say now and for the record, that Captain Kirk ordered the Enterprise across the Neutral Zone on his own initiative and his craving for glory."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Kirk,having to be held back by the guards,"I'll kill you, you filthy traitor! I'll kill you! I'll kill you!"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,He is not sane.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,into comm. system,"Attention, Enterprise, I am speaking to you from the Romulan flagship."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Commander,,"The USS Enterprise, under command of Captain James T. Kirk, is formally charged with espionage. The testimony of First Officer"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Commander,,Spock was highly instrumental in confirming this intrusion into Romulan space was not an accident. First Officer Spock's testimony was specific that your ship was not under orders from Starfleet Command or the Federation council to perform such a spy mission.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,"It was Captain Kirk who was solely responsible. Since the crew had no choice but to obey orders, the crew will not be held responsible. Therefore, I am ordering Engineer Scott, presently in command of the Enterprise, to follow the Romulan flagship"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Commander,,"To our home base. You will there be processed and released to Federation Command. Until judgment is passed, Captain Kirk will be held in confinement."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Scott,,"Security, put our two Romulan hostages in the brig. Lieutenant Uhura, give me a channel to that ship."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Uhura,,"Channel is open, Mister Scott, and you are tied in."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Scott,,"This is Lieutenant Commander Scott. The Enterprise takes no orders, except those of Captain"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Scott,,"Kirk, And we will stay right here until he returns. And if you make any attempt to board or commandeer the Enterprise, it will be blown to bits along with as many of you as we can take with us."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,You humans make a brave noise. There are ways to convince you of your errors.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Kirk,,"Did you hear that, you coward? You've betrayed everything of value you ever knew. Did you hear the sound of human integrity?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,Take him to the security room.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,,"Kirk is dragged out, struggling.",
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,"A Vulcan among humans. Living, working with them. I would think the situation would be intolerable to you."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,I am half Vulcan. My mother is a human.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,To whom is your allegiance then? Do you call yourself Terran or Vulcan?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,Vulcan.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,"How long have you been a Starfleet officer, Spock?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,Eighteen years.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,And you serve Captain Kirk. Do you like him? Do you like your shipmates?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,The question is irrelevant.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,"Possibly, but you are subordinate to Captain Kirk's orders, even to his whims."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,My duty as an officer is to obey him.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,You are a superior being. Why do you not command?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,I do not desire a ship of my own.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,"Or is it that no one has offered you, a Vulcan, that opportunity?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,Such opportunities are extremely rare.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,"For someone with your capabilities and accomplishments, opportunities are made and will be. I will see to that, if you'll stop looking on the Federation as the whole universe. It is not, you know."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,That thought has occasionally crossed my mind.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,You must have your own ship.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Spock,,"Commander, shall we speak plainly? It is you who desperately need a ship. You want the Enterprise."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,Of course. It would be a great achievement for me to bring home the Enterprise intact. It would broaden the scope of my powers greatly. It would be the achievement of a lifetime. And it would open equal opportunities for you.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,,"Kirk is finally flung into the Romulan brig, where he tests out the pain-giving properties of the force-field across the doorway.",

59,3,The Enterprise Incident,mccoy's quarters,Mccoy,,McCoy here.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Uhura,,"Doctor, you must beam aboard the Romulan flagship immediately. There's been an injury."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,mccoy's quarters,Mccoy,,I don't make house calls.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Uhura,,"Doctor, it's Captain Kirk!"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,,"McCoy is scanning Kirk, who is twitching slightly.",
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Mccoy,,"He'll recover, but he'll need further attention. Inform your superior."

59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's office,Commander,,Yes? I'll come there. Attend me.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan corridor,,Two guards walk a discreet distance behind them.,
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan corridor,Commander,,"I neglected to mention, I'll expect you for dinner. We have much to discuss."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan corridor,Spock,,Indeed.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan corridor,Commander,,Allow me to rephrase. Will you join me for dinner?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan corridor,Spock,,"I am honoured, Commander. Are the guards also invited?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan corridor,,"She dismisses them. They walk on, and Spock turns a corner.",
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan corridor,Commander,,Mister Spock. That corridor is forbidden to all but loyal Romulans.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan corridor,Spock,,Of course. I shall obey your restrictions.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan corridor,Commander,,I hope that one day there will be no need for you to observe any restrictions.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan corridor,Spock,,It would be illogical to assume that all conditions remain stable.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Commander,,Are you the doctor?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Mccoy,,McCoy. Chief medical officer.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Commander,,Captain Kirk's condition?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Mccoy,,"Well, you can see for yourself, he's mentally depressed, physically weak, disoriented, displays feelings of persecution and rebellion."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Commander,,"Then by your own standards of normality, this man is not fully competent."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Mccoy,,"No, not now."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Commander,,Mister Spock has stated that he believes the captain had no authority or order to cross the Neutral Zone. Could this mental incapacity have afflicted him earlier?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Mccoy,,"Yes, it's possible."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Commander,,"Mister Spock, the doctor has now confirmed your testimony as to the mental state of your captain. He was and is unfit to continue in command of the Enterprise. That duty has fallen on you. Are you ready to exercise that function?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Spock,,I am ready.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Mccoy,,"Spock, I don't believe it. There's no price you could pay that would make him sell out."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Spock,,"The matter is not open for discussion, Doctor."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Mccoy,,"What do you mean, the matter's not open for discussion?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Commander,,"That's enough, Doctor. As a physician, your duty is to save lives. Mister Spock's duty is to lead the Enterprise and its crew to a safe haven."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Spock,,"There is no alternative, Doctor. The safety of the crew is now the paramount issue. It is misguided loyalty to resist any further."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Kirk,,You traitor. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you!
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,,"Kirk lunges feebly at Spock, who places his hand over Kirk's face. Kirk falls back, face contorted with pain.",
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Mccoy,,What did you do? What did you do?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Spock,,I was unprepared for his attack. I instinctively used the Vulcan death grip.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan brig,Mccoy,,"Your instincts are still good, Mister Spock. The captain is dead."

59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well now that you know it, you might as well assist me. Hand me the physiostimulator."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Chapel,,But he was dead. Their doctors certified he was dead.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Mccoy,,Spock gave him a nerve pinch to simulate death.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Chapel,,"Then Mister Spock isn't a traitor, and you knew that and you didn't"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Mccoy,,I didn't know it until I beamed aboard the Romulan ship. Jim and Spock were operating under Federation orders.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,,The green light goes out as Kirk wakes up properly.,
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Kirk,,Oh. (sitting up) My neck feels like it's been twisted off.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Mccoy,,That's the Vulcan death grip for you.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Chapel,,There's no such thing as a Vulcan death grip.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Kirk,,"Ah, but the Romulans don't know that. Sure fooled the doctors."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Mccoy,,You took a big chance they didn't start an autopsy.

59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Narrator,,CHAPEL:: Why?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Kirk,,That's what this whole masquerade was about. To keep the Enterprise and the Federation off the hook.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Mccoy,,"So that if anything went wrong, you would be the one to blame."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Kirk,,"Bones, I want you to prepare for surgery."

59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Scott,,"All right, Doctor, what's so urgent that... Captain? Captain Kirk."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Kirk,,Yes.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Scott,,"Well, you look like the devil himself, but as long as you're alive. What's it all about?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,,Kirk has slanted eyebrows and pointed ears.,
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Kirk,,Are those Romulan officers still aboard the ship?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Scott,,"They're in the brig, sir."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Kirk,,I'll need a Romulan uniform.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,sickbay,Narrator,,SCOTT; Aye. It'll be a pleasure.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Commander,,I've had special Vulcan dishes prepared for you. I hope they're to your liking.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Spock,,"I am very flattered, Commander. There's no doubt that the cuisine aboard your vessel is far superior to that of the Enterprise. It is indeed a very powerful recruiting inducement."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Commander,,We have other inducements.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,,"She offers him a glass of blue liquid. He accepts, they silently toast each other and drink.",

59,3,The Enterprise Incident,transporter room,Mccoy,,What the devil is Spock doing? What's delaying him?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,transporter room,Kirk,,"I wish I knew. Scotty, are you sure we have a clear channel to Spock?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,transporter room,Scott,,"Aye, sir. No doubt of it."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,transporter room,Kirk,,Then we can't wait any longer. Prepare to beam me aboard the flagship.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,transporter room,Scott,,But Mister Spock hasn't sent the proper co-ordinates yet.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,transporter room,Kirk,,"It can't be helped, Scotty."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,transporter room,Mccoy,,"You're taking an awful chance, Jim."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,transporter room,Kirk,,Just don't put me inside a bulkhead. Energise.

59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan corridor,Romulan,,"Centurion. I'm sorry, no one is allowed"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan corridor,Kirk,,I've just effected an escape from the Federation vessel. I have important information for Sub-commander Tal. Where is he?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan corridor,Romulan,,"He's in control central, sir."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan corridor,Kirk,,Good. I shall remember to mention your alertness to him. Return to your duty.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan corridor,Romulan,,"Thank you, Centurion."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,,"Now, orange liquid is being poured out as Spock eats.",
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Commander,,"You have nothing in Starfleet to which to return. I offer, we offer you an alternative. We will find a place for you, if you wish it."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Spock,,A place?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Commander,,With me. Romulan women are not like Vulcan females. We are not dedicated to pure logic and the sterility of non-emotion. Our people are warriors. Often savage. But we are also many other pleasant things.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Spock,,I was not aware of that aspect of Romulan society.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Commander,,"As a Vulcan, you would study it. As a human you would find ways to appreciate it."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Spock,,Please believe me. I do appreciate it.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Commander,,"I am so glad. Now one final step to make the occasion complete. You will lead a small party of Romulans aboard the Enterprise, and there you will take your rightful place as its commander. And you will lead the ship to a Romulan port, with my flagship at its side."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Spock,,"Yes, of course, but not just this moment. An hour from now will do even better. Would it not, Commander?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Commander,,"Yes. Yes, it will, Mister Spock. You do know I have a first name."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Spock,,I was beginning to wonder.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Commander,,"Well, I do. Would you like to hear it?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,,She whispers in his ear.,
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Spock,,"How rare, and how beautiful. But so incongruous when spoken by a soldier."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Commander,,"If you will give me a moment, the soldier will transform herself into a woman."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,,She leaves the room.,
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Spock,,Spock to Captain Kirk.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Kirk,,Kirk here.

59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan ship,Spock,,Are you prepared to beam over?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan ship,Kirk,,"I'm already on board, Spock. Do you have the information?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Spock,,"Yes, Captain. The cloaking device is in an area near the commander's quarters. It is closely guarded and off-limits to all but authorised personnel. What is your present location?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan bridge,Officer,,"Sub-commander Tal. I'm receiving an alien transmission from within our vessel, sir."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan bridge,Tal,,Alien? Are you certain?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan bridge,Officer,,"Yes, Sub-commander."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan bridge,Tal,,I must know the source!
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan bridge,Officer,,"Triangulating now, sir."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan ship,Kirk,,"Spock, I'll get the cloaking device. Will you be able to get back to the Enterprise without attracting their attention?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Spock,,"Unknown, Captain. At present, I am rather heavily"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,,"He quickly shuts and hides his communicator as the door opens, and the Commander enters. She is wearing a figure hugging dress.",
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Commander,,"Is my attire now more appropriate, Mister Spock?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Spock,,"Commander, your attire is not only more appropriate, it should actually stimulate our conversation."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,,"He makes the Vulcan V-sign. She does the same, and they touch hands.",
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,secure area,Guard,,"Centurion, have you clearance for this area? I do not recognise you."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,secure area,Kirk,,There's an intruder aboard. Has someone tried to gain entrance there?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,secure area,Guard,,"I must see your authorisation, sir."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,secure area,Kirk,,Over there!
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,secure area,,He knocks the guard out.,
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,,Now they are stroking each other's face.,
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Commander,,It's hard to believe that I can be so moved by the touch of an alien hand.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Spock,,I must confess that I too am moved emotionally. I know it is illogical.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Commander,,"Mister Spock, we mustn't question what we truly feel. Accept what is happening between us, even as I do."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,,The doorbell buzzes,
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Tal,,Commander? Permission to enter.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Commander,,"Not now, Tal."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Tal,,"It is urgent, Commander."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,,She leaves Spock and goes to the door. Tal and guards enter.,

59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,,Spock comes out from behind the dividing curtain and shows his communicator.,
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Commander,,The cloaking device. Bring him.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,cloaking device room,,Kirk manages to get in and starts looking around.,
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,cloaking device room,Romulan,,Halt. Don't move. Who are you? What are you doing in here?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,cloaking device room,Kirk,,There's an enemy spy aboard. He'll be after the cloaking device.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,cloaking device room,Romulan,,Drop your weapon.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,cloaking device room,,"Kirk does so, and as the Romulan bends to pick it up he kicks him unconscious. As Tal, Spock, the Commander and the guards make their way down the corridor, Kirk takes the globe with bits of Nomad sticking out of it, out of its control console.",
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,cloaking device room,Kirk,,"Scotty, energise."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,transporter room,Scott,,"But, sir, what about Mister Spock?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,transporter room,Kirk,,We'll just have to hope he can buy us enough time to get this cloaking device installed.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,transporter room,Scott,,It'll have to hook into our deflector shield control.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,transporter room,Kirk,,Can you do it?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,transporter room,Scott,,"I don't know, sir."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,transporter room,Kirk,,"You have fifteen minutes, Scotty."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,cloaking device room,Tal,,"Commander, the cloaking device is gone."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,cloaking device room,Commander,,Full alert. Search all decks.

59,3,The Enterprise Incident,cloaking device room,Spock,,"That will be profitless, Commander. I do not believe you will find it."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,cloaking device room,Commander,,You must be mad.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,cloaking device room,Spock,,I assure you I am quite sane.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,cloaking device room,Commander,,Why would you do this to me? What are you that you could do this?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,cloaking device room,Spock,,"First officer of the Enterprise. (Broken-hearted, she slaps his face.) What is your present form of execution?"
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,cloaking device room,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 5027.4. Commander Scott has less than fifteen minutes to install the Romulan's cloaking device and get it working. I hope Mister Spock can buy us the time we need."

59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Kirk,,"We'll discuss it later. Mister Sulu, lay in a course for home. Mister Chekov, take the sensors. Mister Spock is still aboard the Romulan flagship. I want his body readings pinpointed and isolated. That was not a request, gentlemen."

59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Spock,,"My crime is sabotage. I freely admit my guilt. (Scott is continuing to work) The oath I swore as a Starfleet officer is both specific and binding. As long as I wear the uniform, my duty is to protect the security of the Federation. Clearly, your new cloaking device is a threat to that security. I carried out my duty."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Commander,,"Everyone carries out his duty. You state the obvious, Spock."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Spock,,There is no regulation regarding the content of my statement. May I continue?
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,romulan commander's quarters,Commander,,Very well. Your twenty minutes is almost up.
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov, there's only one Vulcan aboard that ship. He should be easy enough to locate."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Chekov,,"Romulans and Vulcans appear to read almost exactly alike. There is just a slight difference which. Got him, sir."
59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Kirk,,Feed the co-ordinates to the transporter room on the double. Have them prepare to beam him aboard on my signal.

59,3,The Enterprise Incident,bridge,Commander,,Of course. It's expected.

60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,planet surface,Mccoy,,Come on. It's time to be going.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,planet surface,Kirk,,Whatever happened here is locked up inside those children.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,planet surface,Spock,,The attack on Professor Starnes' party must surely have been unprovoked.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,planet surface,Kirk,,Attack? Mass suicide is what it seems to be.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,planet surface,Spock,,"I stand corrected, Captain. Induced would be a more precise term. Induced by an outside force."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,planet surface,Kirk,,Such as?
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,planet surface,Spock,,The release of bacteria. Or a helpless mental depression and a state of suicidal anxiety could have been chemically induced.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,planet surface,Kirk,,What would make the children immune?
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,planet surface,Spock,,"I do not know, but it is possible."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,planet surface,Kirk,,Then the children would have been exempted by conscious design.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,planet surface,Spock,,"A valid assumption, I would say."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,planet surface,Kirk,,And their present behaviour explained by a fear of punishment. SPOCK: Or the promise of reward.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,planet surface,Kirk,,"An attack by an unknown assailant on an uninhabited planet. This planet is uninhabited, Mister Spock, to the best of our information?"
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,planet surface,Spock,,"At present, yes. (his tricorder beeps) Odd."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,planet surface,Kirk,,Getting a reading?
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,planet surface,Spock,,There seems to be some disturbance coming from that cave.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,cave,Kirk,,"Picking up any life-forms, Mister Spock?"
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,cave,Spock,,"Definitely not humanoid, Captain. Impossible to make any specific identification. The readings do not correlate with any known information."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,cave,Kirk,shivers,"Oh, that's strange. That's very strange. I'm getting a feeling of anxiety in this place. It doesn't sound very scientific, does it? But it's strongest right here."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,cave,Spock,,"I'm not aware of it, Captain."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,cave,Kirk,,Maybe that's what's registering on your tricorder.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,cave,Spock,,"I am not familiar with anxiety, but I wasn't aware it could be registered on sensors."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,cave,Kirk,,"No, of course. That's, that's me. That's me. But what's causing your tricorder to react?"
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,cave,,Kirk dashes out of the cave.,
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,planet surface,Spock,,"Are you all right, Captain?"
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,planet surface,Kirk,,"Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. Just some sympathetic vibration with what happened here. Let's get back to the ship. I want to check out those tapes from Professor Starnes' tricorder. And I am going to question those children."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,rec room,,"I assume it is, although there are a lot more plants around the room than we usually see.",
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,rec room,Chapel,,"All right, children. Each card is a different flavour. You take your pick, and the computer will mix your favourite combination. Now, what would you like? Call out your favourites."

60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,rec room,Steve,he gets his ice cream,It's coconut and vanilla. They're both white.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,rec room,Chapel,,"There, there now, Stevie. There are unpleasant surprises as well as pleasant ones. That was your unpleasant surprise. Now, what would you like for your pleasant surprise?"
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,rec room,Steve,,Chocolate wobble and pistachio.

60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,rec room,Steve,,And peach.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,rec room,Chapel,,All right. It's going to be a wonderful surprise.

60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Mccoy,,"Well, can't it wait till we get to a Starbase hospital so they can be checked out by child specialists?"
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Kirk,,We're not leaving here until we find out what went on or what's going on.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Mccoy,,"Well, I won't prevent you questioning them, but it could harm the children if you do."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Kirk,,"It could be far worse for them if I don't, and for us too."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Mccoy,,Be careful.

60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,rec room,Kirk,,"I'm sure your parents loved you. That's why they took you with them to Triacus. So they wouldn't be so far away from you for such a long time. That would make them very unhappy and miss you. I'm sure that you would miss them, too."

60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,rec room,Mary,,Yeah.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,rec room,Kirk,,"All right, children, you've had a busy day. I think you could use some rest. Nurse Chapel will see you to your quarters."

60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,rec room,Kirk,,What about?
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,rec room,Tommy,,I didn't ask him.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,rec room,Kirk,,What was going on that would have upset him?
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,rec room,Tommy,,"How should I know? He was always upset, just like you, Captain Kirk."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,rec room,Kirk,,"I'm not upset with you, Tommy, or your friends. We invited you aboard the Enterprise. Why would I do that if I didn't like you?"
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,rec room,Tommy,,You have your reasons.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,rec room,Kirk,,Aren't you unhappy about leaving Triacus?

Now our destination is a Federation settlement. Captain Kirk will undoubtedly choose a closer station. Do not let that deter you. Marcos Twelve has millions of people on it. Nearly a million will join us as our friends. The rest will be our enemies. Together with our other friends who will join us, we will defeat our enemies as we defeated them on Triacus. A million friends on Marcos will make us invincible. No one will tell us where to go, when to sleep, where to eat. The universe will be mine to command, yours to play in. To accomplish this great mission, we must first control the Enterprise. To control the ship, we first must control the crew. You know how to do that. That is your next task.

60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Starnes,,"Log date 5025.3. Ever since our arrival on Triacus, I've felt a certain growing feeling of uneasiness. At first I attributed it to the usual case of nerves associated with any new project. However, I've found that the rest of my associates are also bothered by these anxieties. The only ones not affected are the children Bless them, they find the whole thing an exciting adventure. Ah, to be young again."

Although whatever civilisation that might have been here was destroyed by some natural catastrophe, it would appear that one of the race took refuge in the cave.

60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"According to the legend, Triacus was the seat of a band of marauders who made constant war throughout the system of Epsilon Indi. After many centuries, the destroyers were themselves destroyed by those they had preyed upon."

60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, why are we bothering Starfleet?"
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,"That was an order, Spock."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Spock,,This bridge is under complete control.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,Complete?
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Spock,,There is no need.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,Take a look around you.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,,"Spock tries to reach for his controls, but Tommy intervenes.",
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Spock,,"I cannot obey your order, Captain."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,,"A vain communications officer who cannot ignore a reflection, a helmsman who thinks he is flying the ship through a tunnel of swords... Kirk goes to the security guard.",
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,Take Mister Sulu to his quarters. He is relieved of duty.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,,"But Tommy stops the guard, and everyone else, from hearing what the captain is saying. It sounds total gibberish. Only Spock manages to clear his mind.",
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,Confine them to quarters. Did you hear me? Did you hear me?
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,,Tommy summons Kirk's beast to haunt him. Loss of confidence and control. Fear of indecision.,
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, we must get off this bridge."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, we must. I'm losing command. I'm losing my ability to command. I'm losing the Enterprise."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,turbolift,Kirk,,I'm losing command. I'm losing the Enterprise. The ship is sailing on and on. I'm alone. Alone. Alone. I'm losing command.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,turbolift,Spock,,Captain.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,turbolift,Kirk,,I've lost command. I've lost the Enterprise.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,turbolift,Spock,,Jim.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,turbolift,Kirk,,I've got command. I've got command. I've got command.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,turbolift,Spock,,"Correct, Captain."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Spock,,"Where to, Captain?"
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Kirk,,"Auxiliary control, my Vulcan friend. This ship is off course."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,auxiliary control,Kirk,,Scotty. I want you to override the bridge navigation system and plot a course for Starbase Four.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,auxiliary control,Scott,,"I can't do that, sir."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,auxiliary control,Kirk,,Why not?
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,auxiliary control,Scott,,"These are very sensitive instruments. I will not have you upset their delicate balance. We would all be lost, forever lost. (Spock sees Don) Go away now. Go away or we'll kill you."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,auxiliary control,Kirk,,"Scotty, listen to me. The Enterprise has been invaded by alien beings. Its destination is Marcos. If we take it there, millions will die the way they died at Triacus."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,auxiliary control,,"Kirk tries to jump the engineer at the controls, but he and Spock are forced away. They retreat.",
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Kirk,,"No, I'm all right, Spock. My beast is finished. It won't return."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Spock,,"Captain, so long as the children are present, there is danger. They are the carriers."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Kirk,,"Spock, they're not the alien beings. They're children being misled."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Spock,,"They are followers. Without followers, evil cannot spread."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Kirk,,They're children.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Spock,,"Captain, the four hundred and thirty men and women on board the Enterprise and the ship itself are endangered by these children."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Kirk,,They don't understand the evil that they're doing.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Spock,,"Perhaps that is true, but the evil that is within them is spreading fast, and unless we can find a way to remove it"
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Kirk,,We'll have to kill them.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,,Tommy and Chekov arrive with two guards.,

60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Chekov,,I have been instructed to place you and Mister Spock under arrest.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Kirk,,By whose order?
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Chekov,,"Starfleet Command, sir."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Kirk,,"Where did you hear this order, Ensign? Now, listen to me. This order is false. I want you and your men to return to their stations."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Chekov,,"I'm sorry, but I must insist you and Mister Spock come with me to the detention section."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Kirk,,"Ensign, listen to me."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Chekov,drawing his phaser,"Do not force me to kill you, sir. I will if I have to. Will you come peacefully, Captain?"
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Kirk,,"Ensign, listen to me. This is a false order, Ensign."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Chekov,,"I have never disobeyed an order, Captain. You know I have never"
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Kirk,,"I know that, Ensign. You have never disobeyed an order, but an alien being is aboard this ship."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Chekov,,I will not disobey now! I cannot disobey!
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Kirk,,"Ensign, listen to me. You will disobey this order!"
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Narrator,,"Starfleet Command supersedes your order, sir!"
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,,"Spock and Kirk jump them. Tommy's fist is working overtime to try and control the situation, but Kirk and Spock win the fight.",
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,corridor,Kirk,,Enough. Take these men to detention then join me on the bridge.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,,"Tommy is in the Captain's chair, grinning.",
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,The Enterprise will never reach Marcos Twelve. We will not be landing there.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Tommy,,The crew will take us. The crew believes.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,"The crew does not understand. When we make them understand as I understand, they won't take you to Marcos."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Mary,,They will! They will!
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Tommy,,We are going to Marcos! We are going to follow our friend!
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,Your friend? Where is your friend? Where is that stowaway? Why does he hide?
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Mary,,He will come if we call him.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Tommy,,But we won't. We don't need him. We're not afraid of you.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,Good. I'm glad you're not afraid of me. (Takes his seat) But your leader is afraid. What's he afraid of?
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Mary,,He's not afraid of anybody.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Tommy,,He's not afraid of anything.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,"He's afraid to be seen. And when the crew sees and hears him, they'll understand that he is not their friend, and they won't follow him."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Tommy,,He is our friend.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,Then let him show himself. Bring him out! Let him prove to me that he is my friend and I'll follow him to Marcos Twelve and to the ends of the universe!
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Tommy,,No!
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,,Spock enters the bridge.,
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, playback the chant the children sang to summon up the Gorgan."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,All,,"Hail, hail, fire and snow. Call the angel, we will go. Far away, for to see, friendly Angel come to me. Hail, hail, fire and snow. Call the angel, we will go. (The other children enter the bridge.) Far away, for to see, friendly Angel come to me."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,The time has come to see the world as it is. Come on.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,,Gorgan appears.,
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Gorgan,,Who has summoned me?
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,"I did, Gorgan. My beast is gone. It lost its power in the light of reality. I command again, and I ordered you here."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Gorgan,,"No, Captain. I command here. My followers are strong and faithful and obedient. That's why we take what is ours wherever we go."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Spock,,You take from those who do not know you.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,And we know you.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Gorgan,,"Then you know I must win, Captain."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,Not if we join together to fight you.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Gorgon,,"Foolish. You will be destroyed. I would ask you to join me, but you are gentle, and that is a grave weakness."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,We're also very strong.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Gorgan,,"Ah, but your strength is cancelled by your gentleness. You are full of goodness. Such as you cannot be changed. You are like the parents. You must be eliminated."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,"Children, I have pictures of some of you on Triacus. I'd like to show them to you. Would you like to see them? Mister Spock, the pictures."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Gorgan,,I forbid it.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Spock,,Why should you fear it?
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Gorgan,,I fear nothing.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,"So we were told. Mister Spock, the pictures. The children are waiting."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,,"Film of the children playing with their parents appears on Spock's overhead monitor. They smile as they watch themselves having fun. Then they see their parents lying dead, and the smiles are gone.",
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Gorgan,,They would not help transport us. They were against us. They had to be eliminated.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Spock,,"Tommy's father would have destroyed you, but he recognised you too late."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Gorgan,,You are also too late. The kind ones always are.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,"Not always, Gorgan. Not this time. You can't hide from them. They see you as we see you. They know what you are. Even the children learn."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Gorgan,,"You are my future generals. Together we can raise armies of followers. Go to your posts! The first great victories are upon us. You will see. We have millions of friends on Marcos Twelve. We shall exterminate all who oppose us! Our purity of purpose cannot be contaminated by those who disagree, who will not co-operate, who do not understand. They must be annihilated."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,,But now the children are crying.,
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,"Don't be afraid. Look at him. Without you children, he's nothing. The evil remains within him."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,,Gorgan becomes ugly.,
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Gorgan,,"I command you! I command you! To your posts! Carry out your duties, or I will destroy you! You will be swept aside to make way for the strong."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,Look how ugly he really is. Look at him and don't be afraid.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Gorgan,,Death. Death to you all. Death to you all. Death to you all. Death to you all.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,,Gorgon fades away. Sulu's swords vanish. McCoy enters.,
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,It's all right.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Mccoy,,"They're crying, Jim. I don't know how it happened, but it's good to see."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,"It's all right, Mary. It's all right. It's all right, isn't it, Doctor?"
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Mccoy,,Yes. It's all right. We can help them now.
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Sulu,,"Marcos Twelve dead ahead, sir."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,"Reverse course, Mister Sulu."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, sir."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,,McCoy leads the children off the bridge.,
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Sulu,,"Course reversed, Captain."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Kirk,,"Set course for Starbase Four, Mister Sulu."
60,3,And The Children Shall Lead,bridge,Sulu,,"Yes, sir."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,,The Enterprise is at Red Alert as an alien vessel approaches them.,
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Sulu,,"Phaser banks standing by, sir."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Chekov,,Range forty three thousand and closing.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"What do you read, Mister Spock?"
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Spock,,"Configuration unidentified. Ion propulsion, high velocity, though of a unique technology."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"Any contact, Lieutenant?"
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Uhura,,"Hailing on all frequencies, sir. All languages have been attempted. No response. Now using standard interstellar symbols."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,Keep trying.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"Magnification ten, Mister Chekov."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Chekov,,"Aye, sir. Thirty eight thousand and closing."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"Well, Scotty?"
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Scott,,"It beats me, but isn't she a beauty?"
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,Interesting design.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Scott,,I've never seen anything like her. And ion propulsion at that. They could teach us a thing or two.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"Life forms, Mister Spock?"
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Spock,,"One. Humanoid or similar. Low level of activity. Life-support systems functioning. Interior atmosphere, conventional nitrogen-oxygen. Instruments indicate a transferal beam emanating from the area of the humanoid life form."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,Directed at what?
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Spock,,"Directed at the Bridge of the Enterprise, Captain."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,Security guard.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Uhura,,Security guard to the Bridge.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,,A woman materialises and smiles at them.,
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,I'm Captain James Kirk. This is the Starship Enterprise.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,,"The security guards rush in, she presses a button on her wrist band, the power goes off and everyone collapses. Then the same happens to the crew all over the ship. The woman walks over to Spock, and puts her hand on his head.",
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,,Later - after the opening titles - the power comes back on and everyone wakes up again.,
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Sulu,,What happened?
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"Helm status, Mister Sulu."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Sulu,,"No change from last reading, sir."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"Condition reports from all decks, Lieutenant."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,Spock. Where's Spock?
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Mccoy,,Jim! Jim!
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, what is it?"
61,3,Spock's Brain,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,You'd better come down to Sickbay
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Mccoy,,Right now.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,All right. On my way.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Uhura,,"Deck five. Personnel, no damage."
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,,"Spock is lying on a biobed, with a bandage around his head and life-support equipment over his torso.",
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Mccoy,,Now.
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Chapel,,Functioning.
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Mccoy,,Thank God.
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Kirk,,Spock. What happened?
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Chapel,,I found him on the table.
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Kirk,,Like this?
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Mccoy,,"No, not like this."
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Kirk,,What happened?
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Mccoy,,I don't know.
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Kirk,,You've got him on complete life support. Was he dead?
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Mccoy,,He was worse than dead.
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Kirk,,What do you mean?
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Mccoy,,Jim.
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Kirk,,"Come on, Bones. What's the mystery?"
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Mccoy,,His brain is gone.
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Kirk,,His what?
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Mccoy,,It's been removed surgically.
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Kirk,,How could he survive?
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Mccoy,,"It's the greatest technical job I've ever seen. Every nerve ending in the brain must've been neatly sealed. Nothing ripped, nothing torn, no bleeding. It's a medical miracle."
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Kirk,,"If his brain is missing, then Spock is dying."
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Mccoy,,No. That incredible Vulcan physique hung on until the life-support cycle took over. His body lives. The autonomic functions continue. But there is no mind.
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Kirk,,That girl.
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Scott,,Aye.
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Mccoy,,What girl?
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Kirk,,"From that ship. She took it. I don't know why, or where, but she must have taken it. Bones, how long can you keep him functioning?"
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Mccoy,,I can't give you any guarantee.
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Kirk,,"That's not good enough, Doctor."
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Mccoy,,"If it happened to any of us, I'd say indefinitely. But Vulcan physiology limits what I can do. Spock's body is more dependent on that tremendous brain for life support."
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Kirk,,Then we'll take him with us.
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Mccoy,,Take him? Take him where?
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Kirk,,"In search of his brain, Doctor. From what you say, the moment we find it we must restore it to his body, or we lose him."
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Jim, where are you going to look? In this whole galaxy, where are you going to look for Spock's brain? How are you going to find it?"
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Kirk,,I'll find it.
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Even if you do, I can't restore it. I don't have the medical technique."
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Kirk,,It was taken out. It can be put back in.
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Mccoy,,But I don't know how.
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Kirk,,The thief that took it has the knowledge. I'll force it out of her.
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Mccoy,,"If you don't find it in twenty four hours, you'd better forget the whole thing, Jim."
61,3,Spock's Brain,sickbay,Kirk,,You and Scotty have Spock ready.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Sulu,,I've got it again. An ion trail matching when we first saw her.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,Where does the trail lead to?
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Chekov,,System Sigma Draconis.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"Lock on, Mister Sulu. Maximum speed."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Sulu,,Warp six.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,No question about the trail?
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Sulu,,"No mistake, sir."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 5431.4. for fifteen hours and twenty minutes we have been following the ion trail of the spaceship that has Spock's brain. Time left to us, eight hours and forty minutes."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, I've lost the trail."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"All scanners, extreme sweep."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,Well?
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Chekov,,"Nothing, sir."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Uhura,,"No signal at all, Captain."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Sulu,,"It's gone, sir. A sudden deaction shift."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"We've lost her trail, but she went into that system. Mister Chekov, put a schematic of Sigma Draconis on the screen."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Chekov,,"Aye, Captain."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"Read out, Mister Chekov?"
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Chekov,,"Sun, spectral type, Gamma nine. Nine planets, three of them, Class M possessing sapient life according to reports and long-range scanning."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,She was breathing our air. She must've gone to one of them. Show us the three Class-M planets. Mister Chekov.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,,Chekov gets up and goes to the viewscreen to point out the relevant items.,
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Chekov,,"The one on the left, number three, rates letter B on the industrial scale."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,Earth equivalent approximately 1485.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Chekov,,"Yes, sir. Second planet Class M, number four, rates letter G."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,The year 2030.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Sulu,,"But that ship, Captain, either it was many years ahead of us or the most incredible design fluke in history."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"Third Class M planet, Mister Chekov."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Chekov,,"Number six. No sign of industrial development. At last report, in a Glacial Age. Sapient life plentiful, but on a most primitive level."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"Now. as I understand it, Mister Chekov, there are three Class-M planets,"
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Chekov,,"Yes, sir."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"Not one of which is capable of launching an interstellar flight,"
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Chekov,,"No, sir."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,Yet one of them accomplished it.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Chekov,,"Yes, sir."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"Thank you, Mister Chekov."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, I'm picking up high energy generation on planet six."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,That's the primitive glaciated planet.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Chekov,,"Yes, sir."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,The source of it?
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Uhura,,"It could be natural. Volcanic activity, steam, any number of causes. But it's very regular."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"What do your surface readings show, Mister Chekov?"
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Chekov,,No sign of organised civilisation. Primitive humanoids picked up at irregular intervals.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,With regular pulsations of generated energy?
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Chekov,,"I can't explain it, sir."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"I can't afford to guess wrong. I've got to choose the right planet, get there, find the brain. Eight hours and thirty five minutes."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"Recommendations, Mister Chekov."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Chekov,,"Sigma Draconis Three. It's closest, heaviest population."

61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Sulu,,"I say planet four, Captain. At least planet four is ahead of three technologically."
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,But advanced ion propulsion is beyond even our capabilities. It'd be a miracle if they had developed it.

61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,Yes.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Uhura,,Why do they want it?
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes. Why would they want it? Eight hours and thirty four minutes. Planet six is glaciated, you say?"
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Chekov,,Several thousand years at least. Only the tropical zone is ice-free.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Kirk,,But the energy. Regular. It's there. It's real.
61,3,Spock's Brain,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir. It doesn't make sense, but it's there."

61,3,Spock's Brain,cave,Scott,,It could be a warning device to keep those creatures away from the food.

61,3,Spock's Brain,council room,Kirk,,Back into your body. We brought it along with us.
61,3,Spock's Brain,council room,Spock,,"Thoughtful, Captain, but probably impractical. While I might trust the doctor to remove a splinter or lance a boil, I do not believe he has the knowledge to restore a brain."

61,3,Spock's Brain,council room,Kirk,,Yes. Very brief. That's why we must get to you immediately. Beam us a signal so we can home in on you.

61,3,Spock's Brain,corridor,,They walk along.,
61,3,Spock's Brain,corridor,Spock,,"Captain, I have an answer for you. It seems your pain bands are manually controlled. The red button on a bracelet releases them. I know that does not make much sense."

61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,We will die. You must not take the Controller away. We will all die. The Controller is young and powerful. Perfect!
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Spock,,How very flattering.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,You will give life to my people for ten thousand years to come.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kirk,,You'll find another Controller.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,The old one is finished! There is no other than this and will not be another for ten thousand years.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kirk,,"Spock, you're in a black box tied in with light rays into a complex control panel."
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Spock,,Fascinating.

61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,He must stay. He must stay!
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kirk,,"He will not stay. (He makes Spock release her, and grabs her himself, taking off her bracelet.) Now, you took his brain. You will put it back. How did you do it?"
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,I do not know.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Mccoy,,"She couldn't, Jim. Her mind is functioning on a very simple level. Mental faculties here seem to be almost atrophied because of non-use."
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kirk,,She was on the Enterprise. She must have done it. How did you do it?
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,It was the old knowledge.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kirk,,How do you get the old knowledge?
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,I put upon my head the Teacher.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kirk,,What is the Teacher?
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,The great Teacher of all the ancient knowledge.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,,There is a transparent helmet with what look like a whole lot of syringes sticking through it.,
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Spock,,"If I may explain, Captain. She refers to the tape storehouse of knowledge of the builders of this place. I scan it. A most impressive store."
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kirk,,How does it work? Show us.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Narrator,,KARA; I cannot.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kirk,,You must tell us.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,I cannot. Only by command of the ancients may I understand.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kirk,,How does it work? Show us! We'll protect you.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Spock,,It is a device with feeding circuits. They lead into the mind of the priestess leader. Its use is strictly predetermined by the builders.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,,Kirk forces her into the helmet.,
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,No! The knowledge is forbidden! I must not know the secret! I will be punished!

61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,"confident, assured","Gentlemen, the Controller's explanation of the functioning of the Teacher is essentially correct. However, he is giving no credit to me. I provide the means whereby the knowledge is used. Without me, Captain"
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Mccoy,,Without you there could be no delicate miracle that kept Spock's brain alive.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,"Thank you, Doctor. That was very gracious."
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Mccoy,,"Yes. From the very first, I appreciated your ability."
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,"Good, Captain Kirk. Then you also appreciate that without the Teacher, I would not have the knowledge to use that which you have thoughtfully provided."
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,,She points a phaser at him.,
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Scott,,That phaser is set to kill.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,"So it is. That is the knowledge you have brought me. Do not move. If your weapon kills, it will kill you."
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kirk,,"We're not the first to bring you the knowledge of killing. If you continue, you'll kill Spock."
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,"The Controller die? The Controller will live for ten thousand years, and we shall give him all our devotion."
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kirk,,But Spock will be dead. His body's dying this minute.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,Why do you not understand that the need of my people for their Controller is greater than your need for your friend.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kirk,,No one may kill a man. Not for any purpose. It cannot be condoned.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,,He reaches for the phaser.,
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,Do not! I do not know killing. I do not wish to kill.

61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,Correct.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kirk,,How long does the knowledge last?
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,Three of your hours.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Mccoy,,It would be just enough time.

61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,I would not.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kirk,,You must help us. You must restore with that knowledge what you have taken.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,No!
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kirk,,You must put back what you have taken.
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Kara,,I will not betray my people. The Controller will stay.

61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Spock,,"Captain, you might lose the doctor that way."
61,3,Spock's Brain,control room,Mccoy,,"He might, but we're sure to lose you if I don't try."

62,3,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,dining room,Miranda,,"The key is the mind-link that I learned on Vulcan. Once we have learned the technique of forming a corporate intelligence with the Medusans, the designers, that's where Larry comes in, can work on adapting instruments."
62,3,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,dining room,Mccoy,,I don't care how benevolent the Medusans are supposed to be. Isn't it suicidal to deal with something ugly enough to drive men mad? Why do you do it?

62,3,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,dining room,Kirk,,I didn't think that for a moment. What else?
62,3,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,dining room,Mccoy,,"I don't know what it is, exactly. She seems very vulnerable."
62,3,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,dining room,Kirk,,We're all vulnerable in one way or another.
62,3,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,dining room,Mccoy,,Of course. But there's something so very disturbing about her.

62,3,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,dr. jones' quarters,Marvick,,So now you want to help me. Now I know what a mere human male has to do to get a reaction out of you. Make you think he's a patient. The great psychologist. Why don't you try being a woman for a change?

62,3,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,bridge,Narrator,,KIRK; There is someone else aboard who might be able to help us navigate. The Medusans have developed interstellar navigation to a fine art. Could Kollos function despite the sensory distortion?
62,3,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,bridge,Spock,,Very possibly. The Medusan sensory system is radically different from ours. Perhaps for the purpose of this emergency I might become Kollos.
62,3,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,bridge,Kirk,,Explain.
62,3,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,bridge,Spock,,A fusion. A mind-link to create a double entity. Each of us would enjoy the knowledge and sensory capabilities of both. We will function as one being.

62,3,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,bridge,Spock,,"If the link is successful there will be a tendency to lose separate identity. A necessary risk. Of course, Doctor Jones will not wish to give me permission to accomplish the mind-link."

62,3,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,bridge,Spock,,"Not sufficient. Her telepathic powers are formidable. If it is at all possible, her mind must be so engaged that no thought of what I am doing shall intrude."

62,3,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,conservatory,Kirk,,"A meeting of minds is all very well, but what about love, Miranda? You're young, attractive and human. Sooner or later, no matter how beautiful their minds are, you're going to yearn for someone who looks like yourself, someone who isn't ugly."

62,3,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,corridor,Spock,,"This is not a duty that you can assume. I am aware of the fact that your telepathic competence might be superior to mine, but there's a more important factor. The object is to pilot this ship. That is something you cannot do."

62,3,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,corridor,Kirk,,I think I understand. You said it. Pity is the worst of all.
62,3,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,corridor,Miranda,,"Pity, which I hate. Do you think you can gather more information with your eyes than I can with my sensors? I could play tennis with you, Captain Kirk. I might even beat you. I am standing exactly one metre, four centimetres from the door. Can you judge distance that accurately? I can even tell you how fast your heart is beating."
62,3,Is There In Truth No Beauty?,corridor,Kirk,,"No, that won't be necessary. Mister Spock will make the mind-link. No other decision is possible."

63,3,The Empath,huge room,Mccoy,,"The wound is completely healed. It fits, Jim. She must be an empath. Her nervous system is so sensitive, highly responsive that she can actually feel our emotional and physical reactions. They become part of her."

63,3,The Empath,bridge,Scott,,"Aye. Well, as long as we're stuck out here, we might as well relax until the storm passes."
63,3,The Empath,bridge,Sulu,,The storm's already lasted four hours longer than we've anticipated. Do you suppose our landing party could be in any danger?
63,3,The Empath,bridge,Scott,,"That's not likely. The planet's atmosphere will give them ample protection. And if I know Captain Kirk, he'll be more worried about us than we are about him."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,,"Kirk is currently stripped and dangling from a couple of chains, crucifixion-style. He is suffering, and Gem is watching.",
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,What is it you want to know?
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,We seek no information as you mean. Your civilisation is yet too immature to have knowledge valuable to us.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,"You don't need any knowledge from us, yet you're willing to kill for it. Is that what happened to Linke and Ozaba?"
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Thann,,We did not kill them. Their own fears killed them.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,"Well, what did you expect from them? And what do you want from me?"
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,We've already observed the intensity of your passions and gauged your capacity to love others. Now we want you to reveal to us your courage and strength of will.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,"Why? What is it you hope to prove? If my death is to have any meaning, at least tell me what I'm dying for."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Thann,,"If you live, you will have your answer."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,"Come on, Spock, the passageway was there before. It's got to be there."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,"Doctor, I'm unable to lock in on the previous readings. I can find no exit out of here."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,,"A flash, Gem and a clothed but unconscious Kirk appear, along with the forcefield to restrain McCoy and Spock.",
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,"Captain! (Kirk wakes) Jim, what is it? What have they done to you?"
63,3,The Empath,bed area,,"Gem starts to try to heal Kirk, but recoils at the pain.",
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,Help him. Don't be afraid to help him.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,,"She does, taking the pain from his shoulders and the wounds from his wrists. Gem collapses. The forcefield is gone.",
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,Jim. You lie still. I'll check her out right away.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,Will she live?
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,She seems fine now.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,Can you explain what happened?
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,"Complete empathy. She must be a totally functional empath. Her nervous system actually connected to yours to counteract the worst of your symptoms and with her strength, she virtually sustained your body's physiological reactions."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,She weakened. I could feel it. Is her life in danger?
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,"It's impossible to say yet, but supplying your body with life support did drain her."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,"Her withdrawal seemed to suggest the fear of death, Doctor. Only your urging her on caused her to continue."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,That's true. Fear would naturally be her first reaction. Perhaps she doesn't know our captain well enough yet to offer up her life for him.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,Could the strain really have killed her?
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,"Oh yes. However, I'd assume that her instinct for self-preservation would take over to prevent it. How do you feel?"
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,I'm tired.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,"Can you recall what happened, Captain?"
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,"I remember the laboratory, and they wanted to know something. But I, I can't remember."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,Take it easy.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,What's the matter with me?
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,You have all the symptoms of the bends. Nitrogen bubbles in your blood caused the pain. Now how would one get the bends down here?
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,You'll have to ask the Vians. Will I live?
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,"Well, you could use some time in a decompression chamber. But otherwise, I'd say your recovery is about miraculous. I wish I could take the credit for it, but she did the work."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,"Captain, I noted that a light preceded you at the moment you were returned here from the Vian's laboratory."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,"Spock, why do you have to get so analytical at a time like"
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,"No, he's right. Continue."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,I conclude such a light is an energy transfer point linking this device to the power source.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,,Spock refers to the hand device they took off Lal.,
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,Can you tap into it?
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,"If I can determine the frequency at which this device operates, I might be able to cause it to function for us."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,And get us out of here the same way we were brought in.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,I would say so.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,Then I would say proceed.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Lal,,You are called Captain. You are responsible for the lives of your crew. Is this correct?
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,It is.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Thann,,We find it necessary to have the co-operation of one of your men in our efforts.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,We will not co-operate.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Lal,,"When we resume our interrogations, you will decide which of your men we shall use. It is essential. There is an eighty seven percent chance that the doctor will die. And while Commander Spock's life is not in danger, the possibility is ninety three percent that he will suffer brain damage, resulting in permanent insanity."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,,Later,
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,"How's it coming, Spock?"
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,"I do not know, Captain. I'm beginning to understand its operating principles, but that is all."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,"Spock, It won't be long before the Vians come back. You better find out how that thing works and soon."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,"Take it easy, Bones."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,Men weren't intended to live this far underground. It's just not natural.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,And space travel is?
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,Some men spend the majority of their lives in mines beneath the surface.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,"I'm a doctor, not a coal miner."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,"I've recorded my principles and theories on the tricorder, Doctor. Should the Vians return, there is sufficient data for you and the captain to complete the adjustments."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,I'm not a mechanic. I couldn't get that thing to work no matter how many notes you left.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,"Possibly not, but you and the captain together will be able to do so."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,"In any case, Spock, you're the logical one to leave with the captain."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,"The decision's mine. If there are any decisions to be made, I'll make them. If and when it becomes necessary."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,,"Kirk appears to be in discomfort. McCoy prepares a hypo, and injects him.",
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,I don't need any
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,I'm still Chief Medical Officer of the Enterprise. I'll tell you what you need and when you need it. Would you rather have the bends? That's it. Just lie down and relax.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,"How long will he be asleep, Doctor?"
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,"Between the emotional strain and that attack of bends, he's in pretty bad shape."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,"I'm not criticizing your action, Doctor. On the contrary, I'm quite grateful for it. The captain will be spared the strain of making so difficult a decision. You have simplified the situation considerably."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,How?
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,"While the captain is asleep, I am in command. When the Vians return, I shall go with them."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,"You mean, if I hadn't given him that shot"
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,Precisely. The choice would have been the captain's. Now it is mine.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,,"McCoy turns away. Spock sits to carry on working. Gem puts her hand on Spock's shoulder, and smiles. McCoy comes up behind him and gives him an injection.",
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,Your action is highly unethical. My decision stands.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,,Spock falls asleep next to Kirk.,
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,"Not this time, Spock."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,,The Vians return.,
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Mccoy,,The choice has been made. (to Gem) You stay here with my friends. They'll take care of you. Do you understand?
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Thann,,"Come, then."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,,"McCoy puts down his bag and tricorder, then the three vanish.",
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,,Now it is McCoy who is being crucified from the chains.,
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,"Doctor, please understand that if there was any other way to accomplish our purpose"
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Mccoy,,Get on with it.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,,So they do.,
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,Why did you let him do it?
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,"I was convinced in the same way you were, Captain. By the good doctor's hypo."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,Anything?
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,"Hmm. A most unusual device. It is a control unit, but not a control mechanism. In fact, it is not a mechanical device."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,What exactly is it?
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,"This control is attuned to one electrical pattern of energy, the pattern produced by the mental impulses of the person who possesses it. It is activated solely by mental commands."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,"Can you adapt it, re-attune it to fit our brain pattern?"
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,"I shall attempt to do so. However, it is not possible to adjust the control to fit more than one pattern at a time. I am, of course, most familiar with my own pattern. Therefore, with your permission, I"
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,"Do whatever you have to to make it work, Spock. What disturbs me is why the Vians let us keep it."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,Fascinating. They must have known we were capable of comprehending this control and making use of it.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,And that we would use it to escape.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,The only logical assumption is that they wish to let us go.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,And they keep McCoy.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,"That is evidently their intention, Captain."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,to Gem,"Somehow, you're the crux, the focal point of all this. Even before we got here, she was a prisoner. They didn't hurt her, they didn't even threaten her."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,"Indeed, the facts would indicate that she's essential to their purpose."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,"Yes, there is a purpose, but what is it? Has all the pain and terror happened, or been made to happen for you?"
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,"Completed, Captain. The adjustments are delicate. They may not survive more than even one use. However, there should be sufficient energy to transfer us to the Enterprise."
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,Will it take us to McCoy?
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Spock,,If you so desire.
63,3,The Empath,bed area,Kirk,,"The best defence is a strong offense, and I intend to start offending right now. Aim for the lab."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,,"Spock, Kirk and Gem arrive at to find McCoy alone, still suspended from the chains. Gem is horrified.",
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,Bones. Spock. Get him down. His wrists. (they lie him on a couch) His pulse is almost gone. How is he?
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Spock,,Severe heart damage. Signs of congestion in both lungs. Evidence of massive circulatory collapse.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Mccoy,,I
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,Don't talk. Don't speak. Take it easy until we get you back to the ship. What is it? What's the matter?
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Spock,,"He's dying, Jim. We can make him comfortable, but that is all."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,You don't know. You're not a doctor.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Spock,,Internal injuries. Bleeding in the chest and abdomen. Haemorrhage of the spleen and liver. Seventy percent kidney failure.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Mccoy,,"He's right, Jim. Being a doctor has its drawbacks. I always wondered why I (coughs, so they turn him on his side) Thanks."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,How long?
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Spock,,It could happen anytime.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Mccoy,,"The correct medical phrase, ay, Spock? You've got a a good bedside manner, Spock."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,Can't we do something?
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Spock,,I'm afraid not.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,"Gem might be able to help him, the way she helped me, but could his nearness to death also kill her?"
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Spock,,"Uncertain, Captain. Dr. McCoy's analysis of her reaction assumes that her instinct for self-preservation would prevent it. However, we cannot be positive."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,"If she could just strengthen him and keep him from sinking further into death, we might be able to save him."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,,A forcefield stops them from getting to where Gem is crouching in fear,
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,No interference will be permitted.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,She can save his life. Let us help her to go to him.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,She must not be urged or forced to take action.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Thann,,All must proceed without interference.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,The purpose that brought us together
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,"What purpose can all this serve, except the fulfilment of some need of yours?"
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,"We have but one need left in life, and that is to see the completion of the final moment of our test."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Thann,,Be patient.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,Patient? Our friend is dying.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Thann,,Perhaps.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Spock,,"What purpose can be served by the death of our friend, except to bring you pleasure? Surely beings as advanced as yourselves know that your star system will soon be extinct. Your sun will nova."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Thann,,We know.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Spock,,Then you also know that the millions of inhabitants on its planets are doomed.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,That is why we are here.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,This arena of death that you have devised for your pleasure. Will it prevent this catastrophe?
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,"No, it will not, but it may save Gem's planet. Of all the planets of Minara, we have the power to transport the inhabitants of only one to safety."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Thann,,"If Gem's planet is the one that will be saved, we must make certain beyond any doubt whatsoever they are worthy of survival."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,How will the death of our friend serve this purpose?
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,"His death will not serve it, but her willingness to give her life for him will. You were her teachers."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,We were? What could she learn from us?
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,Your will to survive. Your love of life. Your passion to know. They are recorded in her being.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Thann,,Her planet will be fortunate.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,Each of you is willing to give his life for the others. We must now find out whether that instinct has been transmitted to Gem.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,,A small earthquake shakes the room.,
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Thann,,Time grows short.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Spock,,"You were correct, Captain. Everything that has occurred here has been caused to happen by them. This has all been a great laboratory, and we have been the subjects of the test."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Thann,,No. We only created the circumstances. That was necessary.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,Your actions were spontaneous. Everything that is truest and best in all species of beings has been revealed by you. Those are the qualities that make a civilisation worthy to survive.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,,Gem goes and sits by McCoy.,
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Thann,,Behold. That is most significant. An instinct new to the essence of her being is generating.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,Compassion for another is becoming part of her functioning life system.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,,"Gem moves her hands over McCoy, not quite touching him. His bruises and cuts heal, transferring to her before disappearing. She slumps, crying silently. Then she tries for the internal injuries, but falls away in agony.",
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Thann,,She is afraid.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,She's saving herself. She does not yet have the instinct to save her people.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Thann,,We have failed?
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,"No. No, not yet."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Spock,,"Captain, Dr. McCoy's life is not solely dependent on Gem. The Vians too must be capable of saving his life."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Thann,,True.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,Then you cannot let him die.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,His death is not important. We must wait to see whether her instinct for self-sacrifice has become stronger than her instinct for self-preservation.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,,McCoy starts to wake. Gem returns to him.,
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Mccoy,,Don't touch me. Stay away. Jim. Spock. Are you here?
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,"Yes, Bones."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Mccoy,,"Don't let her touch me. She'll die. Jim, I can't destroy life, even if it's to save my own. I can't. You know that. I can't let you do it."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,,McCoy pushes Gem away.,
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Spock,,Captain?
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,What is it?
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Spock,,The intensity of emotion is draining us and building up the force field.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,"Yes, I know."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Spock,,"It draws its energy from us, Captain. In spite of what we see, all emotion must be suppressed. That might weaken the field."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,I'll try.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,,"Spock leaves the forcefield, but Kirk remains trapped.",
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,Yes.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,,"Spock takes the device from Thann, and Kirk is free too.) KIRK: Spock",
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,You cannot use our powers to change what is happening.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,You must save the life of our friend.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,No. We will not. Her instinct must be developed to the fullest. The test must be complete.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Spock,,It is complete. Gem has earned the right of survival for her planet. She offered her life.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,To offer is not proof enough.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,"If death is all you understand, here are four lives for you."
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,,Kirk returns the two devices.,
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Kirk,,We will not leave our friend. You've lost the capacity to feel the emotions you brought Gem here to experience. You don't understand what it is to live. Love and compassion are dead in you. You're nothing but intellect.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,,"Lal goes over to McCoy and heals him, then picks up the unconscious Gem.",
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,Lal,,Farewell.
63,3,The Empath,laboratory,,They recede into the darkness.,
63,3,The Empath,bridge,Kirk,,Strange.
63,3,The Empath,bridge,Spock,,"What is puzzling you, Captain?"
63,3,The Empath,bridge,Kirk,,"I'm not puzzled, Mister Spock. I am awed."
63,3,The Empath,bridge,Mccoy,,"I'm with you, Captain. She awed me."
63,3,The Empath,bridge,Kirk,,"No, no. I wasn't thinking of Gem. I was thinking of that fantastic element of chance that out in limitless space we should come together with Gem."
63,3,The Empath,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, the element of chance can virtually be eliminated by a civilisation as advanced as the Vians."
63,3,The Empath,bridge,Scott,,"Not to dispute your computer, Mister Spock, but from little what you've told me, I would say she was a pearl of great price."
63,3,The Empath,bridge,Kirk,,"What, Scott?"
63,3,The Empath,bridge,Scott,,"Do you not know the story of the merchant? The merchant, who when he found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it."
63,3,The Empath,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, she was all that. And whether the Vians bought her or found her makes little difference. She was of great value."
63,3,The Empath,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, personally, I find it fascinating that with all their scientific knowledge and advances, that it was good old-fashioned human emotion that they valued the most."
63,3,The Empath,bridge,Scott,,Perhaps the Vulcans should hear about this.
63,3,The Empath,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, can you be prevailed upon to bring them the news?"
63,3,The Empath,bridge,Spock,,"Possibly, Captain. I shall certainly give the thought all the consideration it is due."
63,3,The Empath,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Sulu, ahead warp factor two."
63,3,The Empath,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, aye, sir. Warp factor two."
64,3,The Tholian Web,,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 5693.2. The Enterprise is approaching the last reported position of the star ship Defiant, which vanished without trace three weeks ago. We are in unsurveyed territory."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,,You could cut the tense atmosphere with a knife.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, we are registering very curious readings from all sensors."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Kirk,,Specify.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"I cannot. According to our instruments, space itself is literally breaking up. There is no known phenomenon which would account for these readings."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Kirk,,What about sensor failure?
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,Negative. I have run a complete check on all systems.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Scott,,Captain. We're losing power in the warp engines.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Kirk,,How bad is it?
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Scott,,"We can barely read it, but I don't like the looks of it. And I cannot find out the cause."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Chekov,,Captain. Visual detection of an object dead ahead.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Kirk,,"How about it, Spock?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,Fascinating.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Kirk,,Explain.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"There is virtually no sensor contact. No mass analysis. No trace of radiation. We see it, but our sensors indicate it is not there."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,,"As they close in, the bright fuzzy thing on the screen becomes recognizable.",
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Kirk,,"The Defiant! Mister Sulu, impulse engines only. Close to transporter range."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, aye, sir."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant, open up a hailing frequency."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Uhura,,"I've been trying to raise them, sir. There is no response."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Sulu,,"Just within transporter range, sir."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Kirk,,"Good. Maintain position. Mister Spock, Mister Chekov, come with me. Doctor McCoy, report to the transporter room immediately. Scotty, you have the conn."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, sir."
64,3,The Tholian Web,transporter room,,The landing party are wearing silvery space suits.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,transporter room,O'Neil,,"Locked in on the Defiant Bridge, sir."

64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Spock,,"Absolutely no record of such an occurrence, Ensign."
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Mccoy,,Jim. The Captain's neck is broken.
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Spock,,"The ship is still functioning, Captain. It is logical to assume the mutineers are somewhere aboard."
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Kirk,,Use the ship's sensors to locate them. Kirk to Enterprise.
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Scott,,"Scott here, sir."
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Kirk,,Prepare to beam over a full security squad on my orders.
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Scott,,"Aye, aye, Captain."
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Spock,,"Captain, there is no sign of life aboard this vessel."
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Kirk,,"Odd, Mister Spock. Very odd. Spock, you stay here with me. Chekov, get down to Engineering and life support systems. Doctor McCoy, check out the Sickbay. Kirk to Enterprise. Cancel the security squad and stand by for further instructions."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, aye, Captain. Standing by."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Sulu,,"I can't get an accurate fix on the Defiant, Mister Scott, but I know it's drifting away from us. Shall I correct for range, sir?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, I think you're right. Keep us within beaming range, but not too close."
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant engineering,,"The crew in Engineering are dead, so is everyone in Sickbay. The patients were strapped down onto the beds.",
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant engineering,Chekov,,Captain.
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant engineering,Kirk,,"Report, Mister Chekov."
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant engineering,Chekov,,Just like what I found in life support. All dead.
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Kirk,,Get back up here.

64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant sickbay,Mccoy,,McCoy here.
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Kirk,,"Bones, can you tell me what they all died of?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Mccoy,,I'd say these people killed each other.
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Kirk,,They what?
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant sickbay,Mccoy,,"You heard correctly, Jim. These people killed each other."
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Kirk,,Could mental disease have infected all of the crew?
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Mccoy,,"According to the ship's log, the medical surgeon down here didn't even know what was going on."
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant sickbay,Mccoy,,The best I can do is get all the readings I can get and analyse them later.

64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant doctor's office,Kirk,,"Bones, what is it? Answer me!"
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant doctor's office,,McCoy's hand passes through a PADD and a desk.,

64,3,The Tholian Web,transporter room,Scott,,"You got that transporter working yet, Mister?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,transporter room,O'Neil,,"No, sir. Not yet."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Scott,,"Take over, Mister Sulu. I'll be in the transporter room."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, aye, sir."
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Spock,,"Captain, the Defiant's sensors correspond with an extremely high degree of correlation to those of the Enterprise."
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Kirk,,You mean what happened to the Defiant might be happening to the Enterprise?
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Spock,,Affirmative.
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott.
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Scott,,Scott here.
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Scott, stand by to beam us back."
64,3,The Tholian Web,transporter room,Scott,,"I can't, sir. At least, not all at once."
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Kirk,,Why not? What's happened?
64,3,The Tholian Web,transporter room,Scott,,"Everything. That ship you're in is fading out, and it's ripping the innards out of this one."
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Scott,,"It's jamming our transporter frequencies. I've only got three of them working, and I'm not sure of those. One of you has got to wait."
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Kirk,,"Chekov, McCoy, prepare for transportation. You, too, Spock."
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Spock,,"Request permission to remain, Captain. I could be completing the data."
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Kirk,,Request denied.
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Spock,,"Captain, there is a chance"
64,3,The Tholian Web,defiant bridge,Kirk,,"I know what the chances are. Mister Spock, don't argue. Get back with the information. I'll be right there. Scotty, energise transporter."
64,3,The Tholian Web,transporter room,Scott,,Aye.
64,3,The Tholian Web,transporter room,,It takes two goes and a lot of switch flicking to beam the three onto the Enterprise.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,transporter room,Spock,,Energise.
64,3,The Tholian Web,transporter room,,Nothing happens. Chekov switches on the wall monitor.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,transporter room,Chekov,,It's gone. The Defiant just vanished.
64,3,The Tholian Web,transporter room,,Scott and O'Neil start fiddling with the innards of the transporter console.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,transporter room,Scott,,Anything?
64,3,The Tholian Web,transporter room,Spock,,Negative.
64,3,The Tholian Web,transporter room,Scott,,"That's it. I've done all I can. There's nothing out there to grab a hold of and bring in. When that ship went, it must have taken the Captain with it."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Computer,,Computer working.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,Compute the next period of spatial interphase.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Computer,,Next interphase two hours twelve minutes.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Scott,,Two hours and twelve minutes? That power leak has unbalanced the ship and she's starting to drift. I can't hold her in place that long.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"We must try, Mister Scott. The fabric of space is very weak here. If we disturb it, there will be no chance of retrieving the Captain alive."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Chekov,,I don't understand what's so special about this region of space.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"Well, picture it this way, Mister Chekov. We exist in a universe which co-exists with a multitude of others in the same physical space. At certain brief periods of time, an area of their space overlaps an area of ours. That is a time of interphase, during which we can connect with the Defiant's universe."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Uhura,,"Mister Spock? We will be able to retrieve the Captain at that time, won't we?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"Yes. However, the dimensional structure of each universe is totally dissimilar. Any use of power disturbs it. If we are not extremely careful, we shall lose the Captain and become trapped ourselves."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Uhura,,I see.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Chekov,,And die like him?
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,,"Chekov leaps up, pushes Spock away and, screaming, attacks Sulu. Scott grabs him and McCoy arrives to help. Spock grabs his face.",
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,Chekov! Chekov!
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,,Spock neck-pinches him into silence.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,Security guards to the Bridge.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,"What happened, Mister Spock?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,I was attempting to explain to Mister Chekov the nature of our problems in this situation when he attacked.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,Did anyone notice anything peculiar in his behaviour before this?
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Sulu,,I think he had several spasms of pain.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,Did he seem to be getting hysterical?
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Uhura,,"Doctor, he seemed more angry than frightened."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Scott,,He had no cause to be angry.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,,Security arrive.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,Take Mister Chekov to Sickbay. Put him under restraint.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,,Scott and the security guards leave with Chekov.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,Lieutenant Uhura is correct. There was murderous fury in Chekov. The same fury which was evident in the Defiant.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,That's what I was afraid of. Whatever it was that drove the crew of the Defiant to murder each other could be communicable.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,Is there anything you need to isolate the cause?
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,"Time. By the way, Mister Spock, I think it might be a wise precaution to put some distance between us and the Defiant."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"If we are to recover the Captain, we must not move."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,How long will that take?
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,Approximately two hours before the attempt can be made.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,"Spock, are you sure that Jim is still alive?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"The Captain was caught in our transporter beam when the Defiant phased out. It is possible he was spared the shock of transition and survived. However, if we are to recover him, we must catch him at the precise moment during the next interphase, or he will die. And there can be no margin for error. His environmental unit can provide breathable air for no more than three point six two hours."

64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Loskene,,I am Commander Loskene. You are trespassing in a territorial annex of the Tholian Assembly. You must leave this area immediately.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"Spock, in command of the Federation star ship Enterprise. Commander, according to the Federation, this area is free space."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Loskene,,"We claim this territory and are prepared to use force, if necessary, to protect our property."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,We are not interested in your display of force. The Enterprise is responding to a distress signal from one of our ships and is currently engaged in rescue operations. Do you wish to assist us?
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Loskene,,I find no evidence of a disabled ship. My instruments indicate ours are the only two vessels in this area.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,The other ship is interspatially trapped. It should reappear in one hour and fifty three minutes. We request you stand by until then.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Loskene,,"Very well, Enterprise. In the interest of interstellar amity, we will wait precisely one hour and fifty three minutes. But be correct. We do not tolerate deceit."

64,3,The Tholian Web,medical lab,Mccoy,,Has the Captain been beamed aboard yet?
64,3,The Tholian Web,medical lab,Spock,,"Negative, Doctor."
64,3,The Tholian Web,medical lab,Mccoy,,When is that interphase going to happen?
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"Theoretically it already has happened, Doctor."
64,3,The Tholian Web,medical lab,Spock,,"However, the ship's sensors are not responding as predicted."
64,3,The Tholian Web,medical lab,Mccoy,,I thought you had the thing timed out.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"I did, Doctor. The space was disturbed by the Tholians."
64,3,The Tholian Web,medical lab,Mccoy,,You mean you don't know whether you're going to be able to recover the Captain or not?
64,3,The Tholian Web,medical lab,Spock,,Not at this interphase.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,I shall have to recalculate to determine when the next interphase will occur. They do not take place at regular intervals.
64,3,The Tholian Web,medical lab,Mccoy,,You can't wait for the next one. We've had another case like Chekov.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,I had to confine my orderly to sickbay.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"I have confidence that you will soon isolate the cause, Doctor, and prevent further spread of the affliction."
64,3,The Tholian Web,medical lab,Mccoy,,"The disease is not transmitted by the men, Mister Spock. The cause is the area of space we're in. It's affecting the whole crew."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,The molecular structure of the brain tissues in the central nervous system are distorting.
64,3,The Tholian Web,medical lab,Mccoy,,And the madness that affected the Defiant's crew will soon happen to the Enterprise.

64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"Understood. Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to the Tholian ship. Mister Sulu, lock in phaser tracking controls."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Sulu,,"Phasers locked in, sir."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Uhura,,"There's no response on any frequency, sir."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,"What's the use of this battle, Spock? You've lost Jim. Take this ship out of here."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"Ready, Mister Sulu?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Sulu,,"Ready, Mister Spock."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,Fire.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Sulu,,"A hit, Mister Spock."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"Engineering, status report. Mister Scott?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Scott,,"Spock, that hit from the Tholians has fused our power supply converters."
64,3,The Tholian Web,engineering,Scott,,I can't do a thing with the Enterprise now.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Scott,,"She's bound to drift, maybe right through that doorway out there."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,Can you estimate minimum time required for repair?
64,3,The Tholian Web,engineering,Scott,,I don't even know if she can be repaired.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,"Are you satisfied? Spock, why did you do it?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,The decision to fight was logical. Lack of time prevented any other course of action. The Tholian ship had to be disabled.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,"You should've known what could've happened and done everything in your power to safeguard your crew. That is the mark of a starship Captain, like Jim."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"Doctor, I hardly believe this is the time for comparisons. Please go to your laboratory and search for an antidote to the effects of this space. That is your primary task, since we must remain here."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,,McCoy leaves.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Sulu,,"Mister Spock, something has just entered sensor range. It's another Tholian, sir. Loskene must've contacted them when he tried to intercept us."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,Fascinating.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Sulu,,"Shall I lock in remaining phaser power, sir?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"Negative. Lieutenant Uhura, can you open a channel to the approaching vessel?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Uhura,,They're refusing reception. I can't
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"Distance, Mister Sulu."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Sulu,,"Just beyond phaser range, sir."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Uhura,,What is that?
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,,"The two Tholian ships have joined stern to stern, and are now moving apart, drawing a thread of some sort out between them. Then they come back across the viewscreen creating two more lines.",
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"Mister Sulu, I shall run an analysis on those filaments. Tie in all sensors to the ship's library computer console. Switch scanners."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Sulu,,"Yes, sir."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,,Five horizontal lines on the viewscreen.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"There's no analogy to this structure in Federation technology. It is, however, an energy field, and if the Tholians are successful in completing this structure before we have completed our repairs, we shall not see home again."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,,Now the Tholians are adding diagonal lines to the web.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,,"Spock stands on a raised platform, behind a lectern. Crew and officers are filing in.",
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,Spock,,"Doctor, your last report on an antidote on the effects of this space was negative."
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,Mccoy,,"It's still negative, Mister Spock. Theragen is the most promising substance tested so far. We're progressing."
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,Spock,,The urgency requires your personal attention in the laboratory.
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,Mccoy,,"My staff is working around the clock. My being there will not affect the biochemistry of any of the tests. This service requires my personal attention, Mister Spock."
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,,He sits next to Scott.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,Spock,,"A few hours ago, the Captain elected to remain on board the Defiant so that three members of this crew would have the best chance of returning safely to the Enterprise. His concern was not only for them, but for all the members of the crew of this ship. You all know the sequence of events. We were fired upon by the Tholian ship. At that time, Captain Kirk may have been alive. I deemed it necessary to return the Tholian fire for the safety of the Enterprise. The Tholian ship has been disabled. But as a result of the battle, we must accept the fact that Captain Kirk is no longer alive."
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,,A crewman goes berserk and is carried out by three security men.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,Mccoy,,Take him to Sickbay. Put him in restraint.
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,Spock,,I shall not attempt to voice the quality of respect and admiration which Captain Kirk commanded. Each of you must evaluate the loss in the privacy of your own thoughts.
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,Scott,,Attention. (a respectful pause) Dismissed.
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,,Everyone starts to file out.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,Mccoy,,"There is a duty to be performed in the Captain's quarters, which requires our presence."
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,Spock,,"It can wait, Doctor. My duties require my immediate presence on the bridge."
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,Mccoy,,"The Captain left a message tape. It was his order that it be reviewed by both of us, should he ever be declared dead. You have just declared Jim dead."
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,Spock,,"It will wait for a more suitable moment, Doctor."
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,Mccoy,,Why? Are you afraid it'll change your present status?
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,Spock,,"The mental and physical state of this crew are your responsibility, Doctor. At the moment, they are your top priority."
64,3,The Tholian Web,assembly room,Mccoy,,"The Captain's last order is top priority, and you will honour that order before you take over."
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,looking at a medal,"He was a hero in every sense of the word, yet his life was sacrificed for nothing. The one thing that would have given his death meaning is the safety of the Enterprise. Now you've made that impossible, Mister Spock."
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"We came here for a specific purpose, Doctor."
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,Maybe not the same one. I really came here to find out why you stayed and fought.
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Spock,,The Captain would have remained to recover a crew member at the risk of his own life or even his own ship.
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Yes, he would, Mister Spock, but you didn't have that decision to make. What would you gain by fighting the Tholians? You could have assured yourself of a captaincy by leaving the area. But you chose to stay. Why?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"I need not explain my rationale to you or any other member of this crew. There is a margin of variation in any experiment. While there was a chance, I was bound legally and morally to ascertain the Captain's status."
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"You mean to be sure if he was dead. Well, you made certain of that."
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"That is enough, Doctor. We both have other things to do."
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Yes, I have something to do. If this crew is to survive, I have to find an antidote to this space you've locked us into."
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Spock,,You will return to your duty as soon as we've discharged our responsibilities here.
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"There's no hurry, Mister Spock. The antidote probably doesn't concern you. Vulcans are probably immune, so just take your time."
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,,Spock enters the combination to the Captain's safe.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"I must admit I don't understand you, Spock, but I just can't believe that you would want Jim's command. You must know that if you get us out of this situation, they'll pin a medal on your chest and give you command of the Enterprise."
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"Doctor, I am in command of the Enterprise."
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,I would like to remedy that situation.
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"If you believe I have acted irregularly, then relieve me of duty. That is your prerogative as medical officer of this ship."
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Bones, Spock. since you are playing this tape, we will assume that I am dead, that the tactical situation is critical, and both of you are locked in mortal combat. It means, Spock, that you have control of the ship and are probably making the most difficult decisions of your career. I can offer only one small piece of advice, for whatever it's worth. Use every scrap of knowledge and logic you have to save the ship. But temper your judgment with intuitive insight. I believe you have those qualities, but if you can't find them in yourself, seek out McCoy. Ask his advice. And if you find it sound, take it. Bones, you've heard what I've just told Spock. Help him if you can. But remember he is the Captain. His decisions must be followed without question. You might find that he is capable of human insight and human error. They are most difficult to defend, but you will find that he is deserving of the same loyalty and confidence each of you have given me. Take care."
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Spock, I, er, I'm sorry. It does hurt, doesn't it?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"What would you have me say, Doctor?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,,The intercom whistles.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Spock,,Spock here.
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Scott,,"Mister Spock, we have a readout on the Tholian tractor field. I think we can estimate its approximate completion time."
64,3,The Tholian Web,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"I shall be there shortly. Doctor, I believe we each have our respective tasks to complete before the Tholians complete theirs."
64,3,The Tholian Web,uhura's quarters,,Uhura is obviously off-duty as she has changed out of her uniform. She is just putting on a necklace when she is hit by searing pain in her body. Then she catches sight of a ghostly image in the mirror.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,uhura's quarters,Uhura,,"Captain! Captain Kirk, we thought you were"
64,3,The Tholian Web,uhura's quarters,,But the image fades away. She dashes out.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,corridor,Uhura,,"Spock! Mister. Oh, Doctor I've just seen the Captain."
64,3,The Tholian Web,corridor,Mccoy,,"Of course you have, Uhura. We would all like to"
64,3,The Tholian Web,corridor,Uhura,,"He's alive. He's alive, Doctor."
64,3,The Tholian Web,corridor,Mccoy,,Of course.
64,3,The Tholian Web,corridor,Uhura,,"Believe me, I did see him. I did. Spock! Mister Spock!"
64,3,The Tholian Web,corridor,Mccoy,,We're going to Sickbay.
64,3,The Tholian Web,corridor,Uhura,,"Doctor. Doctor, I'm not going mad. I did see Captain Kirk. I've got to get to Mister Spock."
64,3,The Tholian Web,corridor,,She faints in his arms.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,engineering,,An engineer succumbs to space-madness and attacks Scott. Two others haul him off.,

64,3,The Tholian Web,engineering,Scott,,"One of our crewmen just went berserk, but we have him under control for the moment."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,Report to Doctor McCoy all symptoms noted prior to the attack.
64,3,The Tholian Web,engineering,Spock,,Spock out.
64,3,The Tholian Web,medical lab,,We can hear Chekov's cries as he struggles against the restraints in Sickbay.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,medical lab,Chapel,,"Doctor McCoy,"
64,3,The Tholian Web,medical lab,Mccoy,,"Yes, Nurse."
64,3,The Tholian Web,medical lab,Chapel,,I have the diagnosis of the crewman who attacked engineer Scott. It was definitely due to the deteriorative effects of interspace.
64,3,The Tholian Web,medical lab,Mccoy,,"Yes, it's beginning to spread generally throughout the ship."
64,3,The Tholian Web,medical lab,Chapel,,"Are we any closer, Doctor?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,medical lab,Mccoy,,"No, except I'm positive that it's a theragen derivative that's the answer. And it better be the next one."
64,3,The Tholian Web,medical lab,,The web is getting close to completion all around the Enterprise.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,sickbay,,"Whilst Chekov writhes against invisible foes, Uhura lies quietly on the bed.",
64,3,The Tholian Web,sickbay,Uhura,,"Mister Spock didn't believe me either, did he, Doctor?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well, nobody saw him but you, Uhura."
64,3,The Tholian Web,sickbay,Uhura,,"Then I didn't really see him, did I?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,sickbay,Mccoy,,I don't think so.
64,3,The Tholian Web,sickbay,Uhura,,"Will I become like Chekov, Doctor?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,sickbay,Mccoy,,"No, no. We're working hard. We'll find an antidote."
64,3,The Tholian Web,engineering,,O'Neil has a dizzy spell.,

64,3,The Tholian Web,engineering,Spock,,Bridge. Spock here.
64,3,The Tholian Web,engineering,Scott,,Are we slipping into interspace?
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,Negative. We are relatively stable at the moment.
64,3,The Tholian Web,engineering,Spock,,Why do you ask?
64,3,The Tholian Web,engineering,,Scott sees a ghostly image floating by the ladders to the upper level. It's Kirk.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,engineering,Scott,,I don't believe it.
64,3,The Tholian Web,engineering,,Then it is gone.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,engineering,Spock,,"What is it, Mister Scott?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,,McCoy enters.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,Mister Scott?
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Scott,,Mister Spock.
64,3,The Tholian Web,engineering,Scott,,I've just seen Captain Kirk. He was standing there as plain as we are.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Scott,,And then he just disappeared.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,Report to the bridge immediately.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,Sounds like a horror story. Suppose there's any truth in it?
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"In critical moments, men sometimes see exactly what they wish to see."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,Do you suppose they're seeing Jim because they've lost confidence in you?
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"I was merely stating a fact, Doctor."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,"It's getting critical. There have been a number of assaults down on the lower decks. Even Scotty's being affected. If Scotty goes under, that's the finish of whatever chance we have of getting the Enterprise out of here."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"Please leave that to me, Doctor McCoy. I realise that the crew are your prime concern. You can best serve them in your laboratory. I urge you to confine yourself to it until a remedy has been found."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,"Spock! It must be this space. It's getting to me too. I know it's nothing you've done, Spock. I, I'm sorry."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"I understand, Doctor. I'm sure the Captain would simply have said forget it, Bones."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,,McCoy collapses as Scott enters.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Scott,,"Mister Spock, look!"
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,,"The image of Kirk is there, apparently calling out to them.",
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,Captain? Captain? Captain.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,,The image disappears.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,sickbay,,McCoy releases the straps on Uhura's bed.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,sickbay,Uhura,,"Am I all right, Doctor?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Yes, Uhura, you're fine."
64,3,The Tholian Web,sickbay,Uhura,,Then what I saw
64,3,The Tholian Web,sickbay,Mccoy,,It was real.
64,3,The Tholian Web,sickbay,Uhura,,Captain Kirk's alive?
64,3,The Tholian Web,sickbay,Mccoy,,We all saw him. The Captain's still alive.

64,3,The Tholian Web,sickbay,Mccoy,,McCoy here.

64,3,The Tholian Web,sickbay,Mccoy,,I'll be right there.
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Scott,,"Then your fears about that phaser were correct. It blasted a hole right through that crazy space fabric, and only heaven knows where it sent the Defiant."
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Spock,,Exactly. But the Captain remained. Only the overlap time changed. The next interphase will occur here.
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,,A diagram on a desk monitor.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Spock,,Can you be ready?
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Scott,,"That'll be about twenty minutes. Aye, she'll be back together. But we'll only have about eighty percent power built up."
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Spock,,"It will have to do, Mister Scott. (door buzzer) Come."
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,,McCoy enters carrying a tray with a flask of orange liquid and three shot glasses.,
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Scott,,What have you got there?
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Mccoy,,Compliments of the house. To your good health and the health of the crew.
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Spock,,"You've found the antidote, Doctor."
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Mccoy,,"Yes, and I've ordered it orally or intravenously for everyone aboard the ship. I would like for you gentlemen to drink it down."
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Spock,,Ensign Chekov was affected so early. Has he responded to it?
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Mccoy,,He's his smiling self again. I've discharged him from Sickbay.
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Scott,,What is it?
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Mccoy,,It's a diluted theragen derivative.
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Spock,,Theragen? A nerve gas used by the Klingons.
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Scott,,"Aye. And deadly, too. What are you thinking of, Doc? Are you trying to kill us all?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Spock,,"If I remember correctly, it caused fatality only when used in pure form."
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Mccoy,,"That's right, and in this derivative, mixed with alcohol, it merely deadens certain nerve inputs to the brain."
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Scott,,"Oh, well, any decent brand of Scotch will do that."
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Mccoy,,"One good slug of this, and you can hit a man with phaser stun, and he'd never feel it or even know it."
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Scott,,Does it make a good mix with Scotch?
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Mccoy,,It should.
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Scott,,I'll let you know. (leaves with the remaining contents of the flask)
64,3,The Tholian Web,spock's quarters,Mccoy,,"Well, drink it down, Spock. It's the human thing to do. That's a medical order, Captain."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"Welcome back, Lieutenant."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Uhura,,"Thank you, sir."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"Your absence was keenly felt, Mister Chekov."

64,3,The Tholian Web,engineering,Spock,,Prepare for interphase in
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,Fifteen seconds.

64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"Negative, Ensign. Utilising ship's power has thrown us clear of it. Compute the distance from the original location."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Chekov,,"At once, sir."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Uhura,,Have we lost the Captain?
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"We shall soon see, Lieutenant."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Chekov,,The ship has been thrown exactly two point seven two parsecs distant from our previous position.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"Good. Since the Captain was locked into our transporter beam when we were thrown clear of the interphase area, he should've been drawn here with us. Spock to transporter room."
64,3,The Tholian Web,transporter room,Mccoy,,McCoy here.
64,3,The Tholian Web,transporter room,Spock,,The Captain's oxygen supply is running out now. Are you standing by with a hypo of tri-ox compound for him?

64,3,The Tholian Web,transporter room,Mccoy,,"Welcome home, Jim."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Kirk,,I had a whole universe to myself after the Defiant was thrown out. There was absolutely no one else in it. I must say I prefer a crowded universe much better. How did you two get along without me?
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,"Oh, we managed. Mister Spock gave the orders, and I found the answers."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Kirk,,Good. No problems between you?
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"None worth reporting, Captain."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Kirk,,Try me.

64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Kirk,,"Ah, yes. I understand. Well, I hope my last orders were helpful in solving any problems that you don't feel worth reporting."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"Orders, Captain?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,"What orders are you referring to, Jim?"
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Kirk,,My last orders. The last orders that I left for both of you. The last taped orders.
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Mccoy,,"Oh, those orders. Well, there wasn't time. We never had a chance to listen to them."
64,3,The Tholian Web,bridge,Spock,,"No. You see, the crisis was upon us, and then passed so quickly, Captain, that we"

65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Spock,,"Negative, Captain. We've had that area on scanners constantly."
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Kirk,,Then the asteroid is the missile's point of origin.
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Spock,,"Correct, Captain."
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Kirk,,"Full sensor probe, Mister Spock."
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Spock,,"Typical asteroid chemically, but it is not orbiting. It is pursing an independent course through this solar system."
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Kirk,,How could that be? Unless it's powered. A spaceship?
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Spock,,"It is under power, Captain. And correcting for all gravitational stresses."
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Kirk,,Source of power?
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Spock,,Atomic. Very archaic. Leaving a trail of debris and hard radiation.
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov, plot the course of the asteroid vessel."
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Chekov,,"Aye, sir."
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Spock,,"Asteroid has an outer shell, which is hollow. It surrounds an independent inner core, which has a breathable atmosphere. Sensors read no life forms."
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Scott,,Then it must be on automatic controls.

65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Spock,,Interesting.
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Kirk,,Yes?
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Spock,,The course Ensign Chekov just gave for the asteroid would put it on a collision course with Daran Five.
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Kirk,,Daran Five? Inhabited?
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Spock,,"Correct. Population approximately three billion and seven hundred twenty four million, if memory serves me correctly. Estimated time of impact three hundred ninety six days."
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Sulu, match Enterprise speed with that of the asteroid vessel. Mister Spock and I are transporting aboard. Mister Scott, you have the conn."

65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,transporter room,Kirk,,"Well, I think it would be wiser if"

65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Kirk,,"You're right, Spock. The shock was serious because of McCoy's weakened condition."
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Spock,,May I ask precisely what is troubling the doctor?
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Kirk,,"I don't think he would've told you himself, but I think you should know now. It's xenopolycythemia."

65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Kirk,,"Yes, of course it is, because if you did you'd touch the sky and find out that you were living on a big ball. Not a planet, but a spaceship. And that knowledge seems to be forbidden."
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,,Natira arrives with two women bearing food and drink.,
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Natira,,What happened?
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Kirk,,We don't know. He just suddenly screamed in pain and died.

65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Kirk,,You seem to be the special favourite.
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Spock,,"Indeed, Doctor. The young lady did show a marked preference for your company."
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Mccoy,,"Well, now. Nobody can blame her for that, can they?"
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Kirk,,"Personally, I find the lady's taste questionable, but she obviously prefers you, and you obviously don't seem to mind. If you could arrange to be alone with the young lady, Spock and I would be left alone to find the power controls of this world."
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Natira,,It is time to refresh yourselves.
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,,Glasses are handed out.,

65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Natira,,Not at all. The people know of you now. (to McCoy) Are you well enough to go about?
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Mccoy,,Perhaps not.
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Natira,,Then why not remain here? Rest. We will talk.
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Mccoy,,You are very kind.

65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,,The women leave.,
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Mccoy,,I'm curious. How did the Oracle punish the old man?

65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Natira,,"What we say, what we think. The Oracle knows the minds and the hearts of all the people. I did not know you would be hurt so badly."
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Mccoy,,It's all right. I suppose we had to learn the power of the Oracle.
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Natira,,"McCoy, there is something I must say. Since the moment I. It is not in the manner of the people to hide their feelings."

65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Mccoy,,I have an illness for which there is no cure. I have one year to live.
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,room,Natira,,"Until I saw you, there was nothing in my heart. It sustained my life, but nothing more. Now it sings. I could be happy to have that feeling for a day, a week, a month, a year. Whatever the creators hold in store for us."

65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,street cum corridor,Kirk,,Fabrini? Didn't the Fabrini sun go nova and destroy its planets?
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,street cum corridor,Spock,,"Yes. Towards the end, the Fabrini people lived underground, as these people do, to protect themselves."
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,street cum corridor,Kirk,,Some of them must have been put aboard this ship and sent to another planet. And these are their descendants. (Once the coast is clear.) Now.

65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,oracle room,Spock,,"Captain. If I remember correctly, the oracle's reprehensible conduct was initiated when Natira knelt on that platform."
65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,oracle room,Kirk,,I think you're right. Continue investigating. The clue to the location of the control room must be around here somewhere.

65,3,For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky,oracle room,Spock,,Nothing here which would indicate this is anything but a planet. There's no question but that the creators would be considered gods.

66,3,The Day Of The Dove,planet surface,Kirk,,There was a Federation colony on this planet. It was destroyed.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,planet surface,Kang,,"By what? No bodies, no ruins. A colony of the invisible?"
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,planet surface,Kirk,,"Yes, a test of a new Klingon weapon, leaving no traces. Federation ships don't specialise in sneak attacks."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,planet surface,Kang,,We have wondered when you would begin. You lured my ship into ambush by a false Klingon distress call. You will tell us why with the proper persuasion.

66,3,The Day Of The Dove,planet surface,Kang,,I don't propose to spend the rest of my life on this ball of dust arguing your fantasies. The Enterprise is mine! Instruct your transporter room to beam us aboard.

66,3,The Day Of The Dove,transporter room,Scott,,"Captain, we've not been able to get through to Starfleet Command. All subspace frequencies have been blocked, and there's too much radiation coming from that Klingon ship. It's a hazard to the vicinity."

66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Spock,,"At the moment we received the distress signal from the colony on Beta Twelve A, the Klingons were too far distant to have been the attackers. Moreover, they also were apparently attracted by a distress call."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,turbolift,Chekov,,Lies. They want to start a war by pretending that we did.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,turbolift,Mccoy,,"Chekov may be right. The Klingons claim to have honoured the truce, but there have been incidents, raids on our outposts."

66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Uhura,losing her temper,"Captain! This doesn't make sense. Carriers are normal. Channels are open. There's still no outside contact! I don't understand it, sir. Could the Klingons be doing something?"

66,3,The Day Of The Dove,crew lounge,Kang,,"Most interesting. The bulk of your crew trapped, your ship racing from this galaxy at wild speeds. Delightful. How did I perform this sabotage, Kirk? All my men are here."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,crew lounge,Kirk,,"Johnson. Get down to Security. Search every section. Some Klingons may have beamed aboard undetected from the wrecked ship. Then get down to Engineering and help Scotty hammer things back to normal. And free those trapped crewmen. (to Kang) And before I put you in the brig, there's a little something I owe you."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,crew lounge,,He punches Kang. A solitaire set on a table changes into a short sword which Kang picks up. A potted plant and 3D chess set become swords.,
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,crew lounge,Kirk,,Phasers.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,crew lounge,,But they turn into swords too. There's a stunned pause then a brief fight as the Starfleet group get out of the room.,

66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Scott,,The doors and bulkheads won't budge. We'll have to cut through.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,Blow out the bulkheads if you have to. We need numbers. What kind of luck have you had controlling the ship's speed?
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Scott,,"No, sir. She's a projectile at warp nine. And don't ask me what's holding her together."

66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,Any other logical candidate?
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Spock,,"None. However, if they had such power, would they not have used it to create more effective weapons and only for themselves?"

66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kang,,I have deprived all areas except our own. You will die of suffocation in the icy cold of space.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,,The power has gone off.,
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,dictating into PADD,"The Enterprise is heading out of our galaxy, controlled by a mysterious alien somewhere aboard the ship. Engineering has been taken over by Klingons who have cut off life-support systems. Mister Sulu."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Sulu,,Captain.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,Get down to emergency manual control. Try to protect our life-support circuits and auxiliary power.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, Captain."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,,Sulu leaves as Scott arrives.,
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Scott,,"Sir. Chekov was right, Captain."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,"Scotty, I'm glad you've come."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Scott,,We should have left those fuzz-faced goons in the transporter. That's right where they belong!
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,Scotty?
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Scott,,"Non-existence! Now they can study the Enterprise, add our technology to theirs, change the balance of power. You've jeopardised the Federation!"
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,"Scotty, take it easy."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Spock,,"Easy, Mister Scott."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Scott,,"Keep your Vulcan hands off me. Just keep away! Your feelings might be hurt, you green-blooded half-breed!"
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Spock,,May I say that I have not thoroughly enjoyed serving with humans? I find their illogic and foolish emotions a constant irritant.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Scott,,"Then transfer out, freak!"
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,Gentlemen! (intervenes as they nearly come to blows.) Spock! Scotty. Spock. Spock! Stop it! You're half human! What are we saying? What are we doing to each other?
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Spock,,Fascinating. The result of stress?
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,We've been under stress before. It's never set us at each other's throats.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Scott,,But this is war.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,There isn't any war! Or is there?
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Scott,,Have we forgotten how to defend ourselves?
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,"Scotty. What's happening to us? We've been trained to think in other terms than war. We've been trained to fight its causes, if necessary. Then why are we behaving like a group of savages? Look at me. Look at me. Two forces aboard this ship, each of them equally armed. Has a war been staged for us, complete with weapons and ideology and patriotic drum beating? Even, Spock, even race hatred?"
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Spock,,"Recent events would seem to be directed toward a magnification of the basic hostilities between humans and Klingons. Apparently, it is by design that we fight. We seem to be pawns."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,But what's the game? And whose? And what are the rules?
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Spock,,"It is most urgent that we locate the alien entity immediately, and determine its motives and a method for halting its activities."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Scott,,Without sensors? All our power down? This thing could go anywhere.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes. Mister Sulu, report."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Sulu,,"No good, Captain."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,jefferies tube,Sulu,,"Circuits are in, but systems just aren't responding."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,jefferies tube,,Then the lights come back on.,
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,We're getting something.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,jefferies tube,Sulu,,"Aye, Captain. Power and life-support restored. Remotes on standby."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,jefferies tube,Kirk,,Good work.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,jefferies tube,Scott,,"But, Captain, I didn't do it. Everything just came on by itself."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Mara,,Their life-support systems have resumed.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Spock,,Sensors may be operating.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,Start scanning. Let's find that alien.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Mara,,Holding steady.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kang,,Cause them to be unsteady.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Mara,,They appear to be controlled from another location. Also unable to affect ship's course for return to our empire.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kang,,One of Kirk's tricks. Could he bypass this circuit? What power is it that supports our battle yet starves our victory? Power. Interrupt it at their main life-support couplings. Where?
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Mara,,Number six deck. (to Klingon) Come.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Spock,,"Alien detected in the engineering section, near reactor number three."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,Let's go.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,,"Kirk and Spock, armed with swords, leave the bridge.",
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,,"The weird light hides as Chekov comes along. He hides, then kills the Klingon and takes Mara prisoner.",
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Chekov,,"You don't die yet. You're not human, but you're very beautiful. Very beautiful."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,,"He rips her top, covers her mouth and I'll leave his intentions to your imaginations. Kirk comes along in the nick of time.",
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Kirk,,Chekov!
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,,"He hauls him off Mara and slaps him twice, knocking him out.",
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Spock,,"Jim, he's not responsible."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Kirk,,"What have I done? (to Mara) There's an alien entity aboard the ship. It's forcing us to fight. We don't want to. We don't know what its motive is. We're trying to find out. You must help us. Take me to Kang. A temporary truce, that's all I ask. Spock, take her."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,,Spock and Mara leave,
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Kirk,,"Chekov. Chekov. (picks him up) Is this what's in store for us, from here on in? Violence, hatred."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,sickbay,,"It's very busy. Kirk carries in Chekov, followed by Spock and Mara.",
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,sickbay,Mccoy,,Brain waves show almost paranoid mania. What happened?
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,sickbay,Kirk,,"He lost control. So did I. We're becoming animal warriors. Let's go, Spock."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Orderly. Jim. Johnson's heart wound is almost healed. Same with the other casualties. Sword wounds in the vital organs, massive trauma, shock. They're all healing at a fantastic rate."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,sickbay,Spock,,It would appear that the entity wants us alive.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,sickbay,Kirk,,"Why? So we can fight, and fight, and keep coming back for more like some bloody coliseum? What's next, the roar of crowds?"
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,sickbay,Spock,,Perhaps human and Klingon psychologies and combat capabilities are being tested by an alien with designs on both powers.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Gentlemen, if we are pawns, you're looking at one who is extremely sorry."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,sickbay,Spock,,"I understand, Doctor. I, too, felt a brief surge of racial bigotry. Most distasteful."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,sickbay,Kirk,,Let's find the alien. (to Mara) You come with us. Maybe we can prove to you that it exists.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,,The weird light is up ahead of them and glowing red.,
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Kirk,,What is it?
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Spock,,Totally unfamiliar.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Kirk,,What do you want? What are you doing here?
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Johnson,,"Reporting for duty, sir."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Kirk,,Duty? Did McCoy release you from Sickbay?
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Johnson,,I released myself.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Kirk,,Then get back to Sickbay!
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Johnson,,"Not on your life, sir. I'm fit and ready for action. The Klingons almost did me in once. I'm out to even the score."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Kirk,,I order you
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Johnson,,"I've got my orders. I'm obeying orders! Kill the Klingons! It's them or us, isn't it?"
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Kirk,,Johnson!
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,,"They cross swords, but Spock neck-pinches Johnson.",
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,,The light becomes yellow.,
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Spock,,"Fascinating. During Lieutenant Johnson's emotional outburst, his expression of hatred and lust for vengeance, the alien's life energy level increased. When the Lieutenant became unconscious, the alien lost energy."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Kirk,,It subsists on the emotions of others.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Spock,,"This one appears to be strengthened by mental irradiations of hostility, violent intentions."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Kirk,,It exists on the hate of others.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Spock,,"To put it simply. And it has acted as a catalyst, creating this situation in order to satisfy that need. It has brought together opposing forces, provided crude instruments in an effort to promote the most violent mode of conflict."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Kirk,,"And kept numbers and resources balanced, so that it can maintain a constant state of violence. It's got to have a vulnerable area. We've got to get rid of it."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Spock,,Then all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated. The fighting must end and soon.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Kirk,,"Or we're a doomed ship, travelling forever between galaxies, filled with eternal bloodlust, eternal warfare. Kang has got to listen. We've got to pool our knowledge and get rid of this thing. (goes to intercom) Kang. Kang, this is Captain Kirk."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kirk,,"Kang, do you read me?"
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Mara,,"Commander, it's a trick!"
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Kirk,,Kang. (switches off intercom) He won't answer.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Spock,,"The alien is affecting his mind, Captain. Soon, it will become so powerful that none of us will be able to resist it."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Scott,,"Scotty, sir."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Scott,,The ship's dilithium crystals are deteriorating. We can't stop the process.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Kirk,,Time factor?
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Scott,,"In twelve minutes, we'll be totally without engine power."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Kirk,,"Well, do whatever you can. Kirk out."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,,The weird light floats off through a bulkhead,
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Kirk,,"And so we drift in space, with only hatred and bloodshed aboard. Now do you believe?"
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,corridor,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate Armageddon. We must find a way to defeat the alien force of hate that has taken over the Enterprise. Stop the war now, or spend eternity in futile bloody violence."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Scott,,"There's no change, Captain. The dilithium crystals are discharging."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Spock,,There's nothing we can do about it.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,"If I could talk to Kang, somehow cut through the Klingon lines, make peace before it's too late."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Spock,,"We have nine minutes, fifty three seconds to power zero."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Spock,,"There is, of course, a logical alternative. Kang's wife is, after all, our prisoner. Perhaps a threat."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Scott,,Aye. Now that's something the Klingons would understand.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,"Kang! Kang, this is Captain Kirk."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kirk,,"I know you can hear me, so don't cut me off. We have Mara, your wife. We talk truce now, or she dies. Reply."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,She has five seconds to live. Reply.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kang,,"She is a victim of war, Captain."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kang,,She understands.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,He called my bluff.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Mara,,You're not going
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,"The Federation doesn't kill or mistreat its prisoners. You've been listening to propaganda, fables. How much time?"
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Spock,,"Eight minutes, forty two seconds."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Mara,,So this was no trick?
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Scott,,"It's the alien that's done this. We're in its power, our people and yours."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,We only wanted to stop the fighting to save us all.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Mara,,"We have always fought. We must. We are hunters, Captain, tracking and taking what we need. There are poor planets in the Klingon systems, we must push outward if we are to survive."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,There's another way to survive. Mutual trust and help.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Mara,,I will help you now.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,How?
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Mara,,I will take you to Kang. I will add my voice to yours.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Scott,,"I wouldn't trust her, Captain."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,"We can't get through the Klingon defences in time, unless. Spock. Intra-ship beaming from one section to another. It's possible?"
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Spock,,"It has rarely been done because of the danger involved. Pinpoint accuracy is required. If the transportee should materialise inside a solid object, a deck or wall."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Scott,,"Even if it could work, she may be leading you into a trap."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,We're all in a trap. This is the only way out.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Scott,,We'll go with you.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Kirk,,No. That'd start the final battle. I believe her. Prepare the transporter. We'll wait for your signal.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,,Kirk and Mara leave.,
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Scott,,"But she can't guarantee that Kang will stop to listen, right, Mister Spock?"
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Spock,,No one can guarantee the actions of another.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,transporter room,Spock,,"Your automatic setting is laid in, Captain."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,bridge,Spock,,"When transporter is energised, you will have eight seconds to get to the pads."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,transporter room,Kirk,,"I hope your computations are correct, Mister Spock."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,transporter room,Spock,,"You'll know in seven point nine seconds, Captain."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,transporter room,,"They dash to the pads, then Kirk returns to the console to leave his cutlass behind.",
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,,Kirk and Mara beam in.,
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kang,,"Mara, you're alive, and you bring us a prize."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Mara,,"Kang, wait. He's come alone, unarmed. He must talk to you."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kang,,"Brave captain, what about?"
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Mara,,No! Listen to him. We are all in danger.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,,The weird light is glowing blood red.,
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kirk,,"Mara. Before you start killing, give me one minute."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,,"Kang swings his sword at Kirk's head, and Mara intervenes.",
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Mara,,"Kang, don't!"
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kang,,"What have they done to you, Mara? Are you out of your mind? What have they done to you? (sees the torn tunic) I see why the human beast did not kill you."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Mara,,They didn't harm me. Listen to him.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,,"Kang pushes her aside, so she throws Kirk a sword. The two leaders have an old-fashioned sword fight.) Stop! Stop, please",
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kang,,"With your death, we win."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kirk,,Nobody wins. Have any more of your men died? We can't be killed. There's an alien aboard. It wants us alive.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kang,,No doubt you will reassemble after I have hacked you to bits!
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Mara,,You fool.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,,A contingent of Federation including McCoy and Spock take on the rest of the Klingons in the corridor. Spock cheats with his neck-pinch. Finally Kirk gets the point of his sword at Kang's throat.,
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kirk,,"Look! Look, Kang. For the rest of our lives. A thousand lifetimes. Senseless violence, fighting, while an alien has total control over us."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,,Kirk throws away his sword.,
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kirk,,"All right. All right. In the heart. In the head. I won't stay dead. Next time I'll do the same to you. I'll kill you. And it goes on, the good old game of war, pawn against pawn! Stopping the bad guys. While somewhere, something sits back and laughs and starts it all over again."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Mccoy,,Let's jump him.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Spock,,"Those who hate and fight must stop themselves, Doctor. Otherwise, it is not stopped."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Mara,,"Kang, I am your wife. I'm a Klingon. Would I lie for them? Listen to Kirk. He is telling the truth."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kirk,,"Be a pawn, be a toy, be a good soldier that never questions orders."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,,"Kang looks at the weird light, then throws down his sword.",
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kang,,Klingons kill for their own purposes.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Spock,,"All fighting must end, Captain, to weaken the alien before our dilithium crystals are gone."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kirk,,Lieutenant Uhura.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Uhura,,"Yes, Captain?"
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kirk,,Put me on ship-wide intercom.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kirk,,Kang.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Uhura,,"Ready, Captain."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kirk,,This is Captain Kirk. A truce is ordered. The fighting is over. Lay down your weapons.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kang,,This is Kang. Cease hostilities. Disarm.
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,,The fighting stops. The weird light turns orange.,
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Spock,,"The cessation of violence appears to have weakened it, Captain. I suggest that good spirits might make an effective weapon."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kirk,,"Get off my ship. You're a dead duck here. You're powerless. We know about you, and we don't want to play. Maybe there are others like you around. Maybe you've caused a lot of suffering, a lot of history, but that's all over. We'll be on guard now, ready for you. So ship out! Come on! Haul it!"
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Mccoy,,"Yeah, out already."
66,3,The Day Of The Dove,engineering,Kang,,"Out! We need no urging to hate humans. But for the present, only a fool fights in a burning house. Out!"

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Philana,,Brain waves.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Spock,,Do these waves cease while you are asleep?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Philana,,"No, not if they're embedded in the unconscious."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Mccoy,,What about medicine? Why no doctors?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Philana,,"We haven't had any pressing need for the medical arts. You see, while still on Sahndara, we instituted a mass eugenics programme. We're the result. Pared down to a population of thirty eight, we're perfect for our utopia. We're bred for contemplation and self-reliance. And longevity. How old would you say I am? Don't be afraid. I'm not vain."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Spock,,Thirty five.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Philana,,"That old? I stopped aging at thirty. Well, anyway, you're off by two thousand years. I'm two thousand three hundred years old. We were married very young. I was only a hundred and seventeen, and he was a hundred and twenty eight. So you see, we scarcely have to move anymore, let alone work."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Kirk,,That's why you have no resistance?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Philana,,That's right. A break in the skin or a cut can be fatal.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,,A column falls over and breaks. The 'chess' pieces start flying around the room.,
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Spock,,Fascinating. I believe we're experiencing the psychokinetic manifestations of Parmen's delirium.

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Scott,,"No discernible cause, and I've never seen anything like it. There's"
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,bridge,Scott,,Ten scale turbulence right now. Emergency gyros and stabilisers at maximum.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Scott,,"If this keeps up, Captain, we can't last!"
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Kirk,,Engines at full speed. Get her out of orbit and into space.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,bridge,Scott,,"I've tried that, sir. She's locked tight."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Kirk,,Then there's nothing you can do but batten down and weather.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,bridge,Scott,,"Right, Captain."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Kirk,,"Parmen's mind is not (something flies past them very fast) Watch it! He's not only throwing around furniture, he's tearing up the Enterprise as well. Bones, knock him out fast."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,,"McCoy tries to give the injection, but gets flung away by Parmen's mind. Alexander gets jerked around too.",

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,,Kirk takes psychic punches.,
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Alexander,,His mind will find me anyhow. Don't save him. Let him die. The others will kill each other trying to take his place.

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Scott,,Scott on the Enterprise.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,bridge,Scott,,"It's all right, Captain. The turbulence has abated."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Kirk,,Good. I think you'll find the orbit lock is broken as well. Assess damage and repair whatever is necessary.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Scott,,"Aye, Captain."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Philana,,"I don't know how I can ever thank you, not only for Platonius, but for myself."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Kirk,,No thanks is necessary.

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Kirk,,"Oh, thank you, we must return to the ship."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Mccoy,,I think I'd better wait until the fever breaks.

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,"Thank you, Alexander."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,Think nothing of it. You saved my life. I think I should tell you that
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,Tell me what?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,"Well, just that I never knew any people like you existed."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,Where is everyone?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,"They're all in chambers, meditating."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,"Alexander, are there other Platonians like you?"
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,"What do you mean, like me?"
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,Who don't have the psychokinetic ability.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,"I thought you were talking about my size, because they make fun of me for my size. But, to answer your question, I'm the only one without it. I was brought here as the court buffoon. That's why I'm everybody's slave and I have to be ten places at once, and I never do anything right."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Spock,,How does one obtain the power?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,"As far as I know it just comes to you sometime after you're born. They say I'm a throwback, and I am, and so are you. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,Don't worry about it. We're happy without it.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,"You know, I believe you are. Listen, where you come from, are there a lot of people without the power and my size?"
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,"Alexander, where I come from, size, shape, or colour makes no difference, and nobody has the power."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,Nobody? Somebody wants me.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,,"And whirling round, he is dragged out of the room by that invisible leash of someone's mind.",

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,That might not be easy should Parmen die.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Spock,,Even if he shouldn't.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,"Yes. This utopia of theirs is one of the best-kept secret in the galaxy. Screening themselves from our sensors, locking us into orbit. All this adds up to a pattern."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,,"McCoy enters, happy.",
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Mccoy,,"Jim, my concoction actually worked. The fever's broken. And what recuperative powers. The infection's begun to drain already."

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,The turbulence hit you that hard?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,bridge,Scott,,"It's not the turbulence, sir. Damage to the ship is minimal."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,bridge,Kirk,,What caused it?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,bridge,Scott,,"I don't know, sir, and those are the facts."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,Did you get up into space?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Scott,,"No, sir. The orbit's locked tighter than ever."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,bridge,Scott,,"And subspace communication with Starfleet, it's completely severed."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,"All right, Scotty. I'll handle it down here. Stand by."

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Parmen,,"Captain, please. You are mistaken, I assure you."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Kirk,,"Parmen, I've talked to the engineer aboard the ship. We've showed our good faith. Now you show yours. I want this ship released immediately."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Parmen,,"The amenities, Captain. Allow me to remind you that I am the head of this principality. Guests do not come barging in here, making demands and issuing orders."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,,Kirk's phaser flies into Parmen's hand.,
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Kirk,,Guests? You don't know the meaning of the word. Guests aren't treated like common prisoners.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Parmen,,Do not take that tone with me.

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Spock,,Obviously Parmen does not wish any contact made with the Enterprise.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Mccoy,,He may still need the ship's medical stores. Why prevent contact?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Spock,,To shut out any knowledge of his brutal treatment of a Starfleet captain.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,"No, Mister Spock. One thing for certain. Parmen is not concerned with my dignity or safety."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Spock,,"Agreed, Captain. And Parmen wouldn't have treated you so brutally if he had any intention of releasing you or the Enterprise."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,,McCoy suddenly stands up stiffly and moves towards the door.,
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,Where are you going?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Mccoy,,"I don't know. I don't want to go, but I can't help myself."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,,Kirk and Spock also move as if pulled along by something.,

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Philana,,"Gentle spacemen, we are eternally in your debt. We've some trifles for you. Please accept them as tokens of our gratitude. They stem from the very source of our inspiration. To our noble captain, the shield carried by Pericles, as a symbol of gallant leadership."

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Philana,,"And lastly, to the physician Doctor McCoy, who saved Platonius and my spouse, this ancient collection of Greek cures, penned by Hippocrates himself."

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Parmen,,"Captain, wait. I know what you're thinking. My humble apologies. You were badly used. In my own defence, allow me to say that my illness was more profoundly disturbing that I myself realised. I am sure that you, too, have been out of sorts and have been driven to fits of temper and rage. Unlike you, however, what I think and feel, whether for good or ill, is instantly translated into reality. So please, find it in your heart to forgive me."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Kirk,,Certainly. Has the Enterprise been released yet?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Parmen,,It will be shortly.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Kirk,,"Then good day, and thank you for the presents."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Parmen,,"Not at all. But there is one final request. After my nearly fatal infection, it has become obvious to us all that we cannot afford to be without a skilled physician. Therefore we should like you, Doctor McCoy, to remain."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Mccoy,,"I'm very sorry, but that's impossible."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Parmen,,"Your duties will be extraordinarily light. You'll be free to read, meditate, conduct research, whatever you like. You'll want for nothing."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Mccoy,,The answer is no.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Parmen,,"We should like to keep it cordial, but we are determined to have you stay, Doctor."

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Kirk,,And you consider yourself a disciple of Plato?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Parmen,,We manage to live in peace and harmony.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Spock,,"Whose harmony? Yours? Plato wanted truth and beauty, and above all, justice."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Parmen,,"My dear Mister Spock, I admit that circumstances have forced us to make a few adaptations of Plato, but ours is the most democratic society conceivable. Anyone can, at any moment, be or do anything he wishes, even to becoming ruler of Platonius if his mind is strong enough."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Kirk,,"And if his mind isn't strong enough, he gets torn apart like Alexander."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Parmen,,"Oh, come now. We are not children. In your culture, justice is the will of the stronger. It is forced upon people by means of weapons and fleets of spaceships. Our justice is the will of the stronger mind, and I for one, consider it a vast improvement."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Kirk,,We don't use our weapons for the kind of brutality you practice.

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Kirk,,No. You're the doctor. They don't want to force you. They need your goodwill. They're trying

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Philana,,Why even discuss it? Get rid of them.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Parmen,,"No, my dear. That might offend the good doctor. You wish to stay? By all means. You can help us celebrate our anniversary. In the process, I hope we can persuade you to join our tiny republic."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,parmen's chamber,Mccoy,,You won't persuade me.

Bones, I know you're trying to do the right thing, but if any one of us escaped, Parmen knows Starfleet would never let this planet go unpunished. Sacrifice yourself by agreeing to stay, and you sign our death warrant."

All the time, I thought it was me, my mind that couldn't move a pebble. They even told I was lucky they bothered keep me around at all, and I believed them. The arms and legs of everybody's whim. Look down, don't meet their eyes. Smile. Smile. These great people, they were gods to me. But you showed me what they really are. And now I know, don't you see. It's not me, it's not my size, it's them! It's them! It's them!"

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,"That's the first time anybody ever thought of my life before his own. I should have told you when you first came here that they were going to kill you. Because I knew, but I was afraid. I was afraid."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,"That's all right. It's all right, Alexander. Listen, we haven't given up, and there may be something you can do to help."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,"Anything I can do to help, you just tell me."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,All right. Did the Platonians always have this power?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,"No, not until we came to this planet."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Spock,,"Alexander, it is possible for you to recall how long after you arrived here that that power began to develop?"
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,How could I forget that? It was exactly six months and fourteen days after we got here that they started pushing me around.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Spock,,And would you know how many months' supplies you brought with you?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,"Well, four, I think. Or three."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Spock,,"That's close enough, Alexander. Fascinating. Their power developed two or three months after they started eating the native foods."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,That's right.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Spock,,Then it is logical to assume that there is a connection between the psychokinetic power and the eating of the native foods.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Mccoy,,Then why wouldn't Alexander have the same power as the others?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Spock,,Perhaps his system cannot absorb the crucial element.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,"Bones, I think it'd be a good idea if you took a reading of Alexander's blood."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,"Not that I'm afraid or anything, but will it hurt much?"
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Mccoy,,You won't even know it happened.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,"You still have a tricorder reading of Parmen's blood, don't you?"
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Mccoy,,"Of course. Parmen possesses the highest order of psychokinetic ability, and Alexander the lowest, in the same environmental conditions."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Spock,,The probabilities are that Alexander was born with some biochemical deficiency relative to Platonius.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Mccoy,,I'll run both their blood samples through for a full comparative test on the tricorder.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,"And if our theory works out, we've got a weapon."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Mccoy,,"The one significant difference between Parmen's blood and Alexander's is a concentration of kironide, broken down by pituitary hormone."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,Kironide. It's a high-energy source. That could be it.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Spock,,The pituitary hormones confirm the hypothesis. They also regulate body growth.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,Oh. You mean the same thing that kept me from having the power made me a dwarf?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Spock,,Yes. It's also obvious why Parmen kept this little utopia secret. Anyone coming down here and remaining long enough would acquire the power.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,"Exactly. McCoy, there must be a quick way of building up a concentration of kironide in our blood."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Mccoy,,"It'll take some doing, but it is possible."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,What are we waiting for?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,,"McCoy takes a couple of ampoules from his bag, then hesitates.",
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,"What is it, Bones?"
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Mccoy,,"Even if the kironide reaches the desired effect, it still may not help us get out of here."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,Yes. There are thirty eight of them.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Spock,,"The point is well taken. However, the psychokinetic power is not additive. If it were, considering the Platonians' hostile propensities, two or three of them would have combined forces centuries ago and deposed Parmen."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,"He's right. Do you know, Parmen says each has his own separate power frequency, because before when they've tried to combine their powers, and use them together, it never worked."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Mccoy,,I'm ready.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,Let's not any waste time. Give us double the concentration in Parmen's bloodstream.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,,McCoy injects Kirk and Spock.,
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Spock,,The time factor concerns me. It may take days or even weeks before there's enough build up from the kironide to be of any benefit to us.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,Yes. What about Alexander?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Mccoy,,"Since the kironide's broken down and injected directly into his bloodstream, it should work on him as well as us. Better in fact, because he's acclimated."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,"Oh, no. Not after what they've done to me."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,Why not? You could conceivably take Parmen's place and run the whole planet.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Alexander,,"You think that's what I want? Become one of them? Become my own enemy? Just lie around like a big blob of nothing and have things done for me? I want to move around for myself. If I'm going to laugh or cry, I want do it for myself. You can keep your precious power. All I ask is one thing. If you do make it out of here, take me with you. Just drop me any place they never heard of kironide or Platonius."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,Alexander.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,,Two figures beam in.,
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,Nurse. Lieutenant Uhura.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,,"The women try to speak, but no sound comes. Then they turn and leave the room.",
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,guest room,Kirk,,I guess we weren't sufficiently entertaining.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,,Uhura and Chapel are dressed in long robes. Kirk and Spock enter in short tunics wearing laurel wreaths.,
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Chapel,,Are we ever glad to see you.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Uhura,,We were forced in the transporter and beamed down. It was like becoming someone's puppet.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Chapel,,"I thought I was sleepwalking. I couldn't stop myself. Captain, what is it? What's going on?"
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Kirk,,"Spock, do you feel any effect of the kironide shot?"
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Spock,,"I have experienced a slight flush, Captain."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Kirk,,So did l. Let's try a simple test. Concentrate on raising this plate of fruit. Nothing.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,,"Shutters draw back to reveal their audience, the Platonians and McCoy.",
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Parmen,,"Fellow academicians. Twenty five hundred years ago, a band of hearty vagabonds arrived on this barren, rough-hewn planet. There was a desperate hardship of backbreaking toil. And then a divine providence graced our genius and our dedication with the power of powers. And through it, our every need instantly materialised. We thereupon determined to form a utopian brotherhood. This night is indeed a festive occasion, for tonight, we welcome into that brotherhood its first new member."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Kirk,,"Not yet, Parmen. You have to convince the doctor first."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Mccoy,,"They'll never do it, Jim."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Parmen,,"Doctor, please. You have destroyed the festive mood of the ladies. We must recapture it at once. I know. What would be better than a serenade from the laughing spaceman?"
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,,"Spock, Uhura and Chapel are dragged over to a couch. Alexander plucks his lyre.",
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Spock,singing,"Take care, young ladies, and value your wine. Be watchful of young men in their velvet prime."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Narrator,,"Deeply they'll swallow from your finest kegs. Then swiftly be gone leaving bitter dregs. Ah, bitter dregs."

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Parmen,,And now let the revels begin.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,,"The four toys are paired up, and the furniture moves around. Chapel and Spock on one couch, Kirk and Uhura on the other. The men swap, then return.",
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Dioniyde,,"Oh, how faithless and fickle."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Eraclitus,,Make up your minds.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Chapel,,I'm so ashamed. Please make them stop.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Spock,,We have tried.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Chapel,,"Please, please make them stop."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Spock,,I haven't the power. I'm deeply sorry. We've failed you.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Chapel,,For so long I've wanted to be close to you. Now all I want to crawl away and die.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,,Finally they are forced to kiss.,
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Dioniyde,,"Careful, Mister Spock. Too much love is dangerous."

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Uhura,in Kirk's arms,"I'm so frightened, Captain. I'm so very frightened."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Kirk,,That's the way they want you to feel. It makes them think that they're alive.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Uhura,,"I know it, but I wish I could stop trembling."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Kirk,,Try not to think of them. Try.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Uhura,,I'm thinking. I'm thinking of all the times on the Enterprise when I was scared to death and I would see you so busy at your commands. And I would hear your voice from all the parts of the ship and my fears would fade. And now they are making me tremble. But I'm not afraid. I am not afraid.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,,"As the camera closes in, Uhura's head is turned to obscure our view - and the lips don't quite touch.",
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Philana,,"Parmen, let's get on with it."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Parmen,,"You are so impatient, my wife. Observe the doctor and learn. He's quite content to wait for the piece de resistance."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,,"A table with a whip and other weapons slides across. Kirk and Spock approach it. Kirk takes the whip, Spock the red-hot poker. Just as they get to the women, Kirk turns.",
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Kirk,,"You're half dead, all of you! You've been dead for centuries. We may disappear tomorrow, but at least we're living now, and you can't stand that, can you? You're half crazy because there's nothing inside. Nothing. And you have to torture us to convince yourselves you're superior."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,,Kirk cracks the whip in front of Uhura's face. Alexander creeps away.,
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Mccoy,,"Stop it, Parmen! Stop it! I'll do whatever you want me to do. I'll stay and serve you, but stop it!"
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Philana,,Parmen.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,,Alexander is frozen in the act of trying to stab Parmen.,
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Parmen,,"Alexander again. He likes to play with knives. Very well, we shall indulge him."

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Parmen,,Who did that?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Kirk,throwing down the whip.,I did.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Eraclitus,,Impossible!
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Spock,,Quite possible and logical.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,,Spock throws away the poker.,

67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Philana,,What's going on?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Kirk,,"Platonians, listen to me. The next one of you that tries any trick will get hurt. Not only do we have your psychokinetic abilities, but at twice your power level."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Parmen,,Not twice mine!
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,,"Parmen controls Alexander and sends him to attack Kirk, but Kirk sends him back. To and fro he turns until finally the dagger is inches from Parmen's body.",
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Parmen,,"Captain, no! Captain! I beg of you, I'll do anything you say. I do not wish to die. Captain, do you hear me?"
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Alexander,,Don't stop me. Let me finish him off.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Kirk,,Do you want to be like him?
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,,Alexander puts down the knife by his own choice. Parmen is dragged out of his seat.,
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Alexander,,"Parmen, listen to me. I could have had your power, but I didn't want it. I could have had your place right now, but the sight of you and your Academicians sickens me. Despite your brains, you're the most contemptible things that ever lived in this universe."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Parmen,,"Captain, you knew that I intended to destroy both you and the Enterprise, yet you spared me."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Kirk,,"To us, killing is murder, even for revenge. But there will be other starships."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Parmen,,"There's no need for concern. They'll be safe. Of late, I have begun to think that we've become bizarre and unproductive. We are existing merely to nourish our own power. It's time for some fresh air. We shall welcome your interstellar visits."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Kirk,,I don't believe you.
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Spock,,"That would be highly uncharacteristic. We must expect, Parmen, that the moment we leave here, your fear would be gone and you would again be as sadistic and as arrogant as your twenty five hundred years have made you."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Kirk,,"Just remember, we can recreate that power in a matter of hours, so don't try anything."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Parmen,,"Understood, Captain. And you're right, none of us can be trusted. Uncontrolled, power will turn even saints into savages, and we can all be counted upon to live down to our lowest impulses."
67,3,Plato's Stepchildren,entertainment chamber,Kirk,,"You're very good at making speeches, Parmen. Just make sure that this one sinks in. Now move aside. Alexander. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott, prepare to beam us up. I have a little surprise for you. I'm bringing a visitor aboard."

68,3,Wink Of An Eye,scalos,Scott,,"I can't get a fix on it. Sensors don't pinpoint a location. We may have a malfunction. I'm about to check circuits, sir."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,scalos,Kirk,,"You do that. Lieutenant Uhura, does the location of the distress call correspond with this area"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,Exactly?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir. I am still receiving visual contact. I can see them, but I can't see you."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,,The viewscreen has five people standing in an area with the same architecture behind them.,

68,3,Wink Of An Eye,scalos,Kirk,,"Well, apart from the landing party, there's no one here. There are no Scalosians."

68,3,Wink Of An Eye,scalos,Kirk,,Check circuits for malfunctions. Kirk out.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,scalos,Mccoy,,"It must be a malfunction. This is a barren world. There's hardly any vegetation, no apparent animal life."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,scalos,Kirk,,"When we've run analysis, we should have some explanation. (waves away a buzz) But there is an insect life."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,scalos,Mccoy,,My tricorder doesn't register it.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,scalos,Kirk,,"It registers in my ears. Nothing, Mister Spock?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,scalos,Spock,,"Evidently a civilisation of high order, rating number seven on the industrial scale. Humanoid in appearance, according to the paintings. An abundance of literature, which I shall have translated and processed. Certain structures hold evidence of recent occupancy while others are apparently long abandoned."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,scalos,Kirk,,No sign of present life?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,scalos,Spock,,"Instrument readings indicate life-form, but of a highly unusual and intermittent nature. They have no discernible form or location. A most puzzling phenomenon, Captain. I shall have to study it further."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,scalos,Kirk,,Something was here. We saw them on the screen. Lieutenant Uhura is still getting a distress call. What happened?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,scalos,Spock,,"Unknown at present, Captain."

68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, sir. Is Mister Spock still down there?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,"No, he's in Sickbay. Doctor McCoy is running a check on the landing party. What is it, Lieutenant?"

My comrades and I are the last surviving members of what was once a thriving civilisation. Those of us who are left have taken shelter in this area.

68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,Freeze it.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,It is logical to assume that this distress call was pre-recorded. What we received was evidently a delayed taped message.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Uhura,,"That would explain our continuing to receive it while our sensors only picked up the landing party, sir."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,"The fact remains, when we beamed down there we couldn't find these people. They were there, now they're not. Nor is Crewman Compton."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,It would seem that some force or agent only partially discernible to our instruments may have been responsible.

68,3,Wink Of An Eye,sickbay,Kirk,,What is it?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,sickbay,Mccoy,,Tell the captain what you told me.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,sickbay,Chapel,,"Something's going on, Captain. Somebody's opened all the medical supply cabinets."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,sickbay,Kirk,,Anything missing?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,sickbay,Chapel,,"Just disordered, as though someone had picked up everything and examined it."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,sickbay,Kirk,,Thank you.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Lie down, Jim."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,sickbay,Kirk,,"That fits in with other disturbances. Bones, what did your readings show up on the other men?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,sickbay,Mccoy,,All perfectly normal. Whatever happened to Compton down there apparently had no effect on anyone else.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,sickbay,Kirk,,Any of them report any unusual experience since beaming?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,sickbay,Mccoy,,No. There's no mention of it.

68,3,Wink Of An Eye,sickbay,Mccoy,,What do you mean?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,sickbay,Kirk,,"I mean that twice before something touched me, and there was nothing there. And it's just happened again. Could I be imagining it?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Physically, there's nothing wrong with you."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,sickbay,Kirk,,But am I hallucinating?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,sickbay,Mccoy,,I'd say no.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,sickbay,Kirk,,"Then we did beam something aboard. Something has invaded the ship. Kirk to Spock. Come in. Spock, come in."

68,3,Wink Of An Eye,corridor,Spock,,"It would seem, Captain, that they intend to allow only the two of us to enter. I should advise caution."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,,There is a contraption hooked up to Life Support.,
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Kirk,,What is it?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Spock,,"Unknown, Captain. But it is evidently a device of alien origin."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Kirk,,Hooked into the life support. Designed to affect it.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Spock,,Life support is still operating. I would say that the installation is incomplete.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Kirk,,Disconnect it. (Spock gets a shock from it) Destroy it.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,,"Their phasers disappear from their hands, then they are pushed backwards.",
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Kirk,,That was no force field. Something shoved me back. They're in here. You! What are you doing on my ship? Show yourselves!
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Spock,,"It seems that we may look at it, Captain, but that is all."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Kirk,,A show of strength.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Spock,,"Yes. Evidently they are convinced that we can do nothing to stop them, and they wish to impress upon us what they can do to us."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,Have your readings been fed into the computer?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,Affirmative.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,Read out.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,"Computer, analyse and reply. Have we been invaded?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Computer,,Affirmative.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,Nature and description of enemy forces.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Computer,,Data insufficient.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,Number of enemy forces.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Computer,,Data insufficient.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,Purpose of the invasion?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Computer,,"Immediate purpose, seizure and control of Federation Star ship Enterprise and crew. Data insufficient for determination of end purpose."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,Is there a connection between this and Compton's disappearance?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Computer,,Data insufficient.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,Are we at present capable of resisting?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Computer,,Negative.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,Your recommendation?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Computer,,"If incapable of resistance, negotiate for terms."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,We will not negotiate. Do you concur?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Scott,,Aye.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,Mister Spock?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,"Your recommendations, Captain?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,"Yeoman, is that coffee available, or have those circuits been damaged as well? (takes a cup from her tray) My recommendation? Make them take the next step."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,,"Kirk hears that buzzing again. We see his coffee bubble briefly. He takes a drink, grimaces (it is black coffee) then everything around him slows down and finally stops.",
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,Spock?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Deela,the woman from the distress call,Captain.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,Would you mind explaining (she kisses him) Who are you?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Deela,,Deela. The enemy.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,You're the enemy?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Deela,,"Yes. You beamed me aboard yourself when you came up. A ridiculously long process, but I've taken care of it."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,What have you done with my men?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Deela,,Nothing.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,Nothing? Mister Spock? Scotty. This is nothing?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Deela,,There's really nothing wrong with them. They are just as they have always been. It's you who are different.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,Lieutenant. Sulu. This is nothing?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Deela,,"They cannot hear you, Captain. To their ears, you sound like an insect. That's your description, Captain. Accurate, if unflattering. Really, there is nothing wrong with them."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,What have you done?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Deela,,"Changed you. So you are like me now. Your crew cannot see you or any of us because of the acceleration. We move in the wink of an eye. Oh, there is a scientific explanation for it, but all that really matters is that you can see me and talk to me, and we can go on from there."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,Why?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Deela,,Because I like you. Didn't you guess? Or are you so accustomed to being kissed by invisible women?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,,"She kisses him again, but he doesn't respond.",
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,Deela. Is this why you sabotaged my ship?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Deela,,"Oh, but it has not been sabotaged. We we had to make some changes in it to adjust it to us."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,You said we?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Deela,,Yes. Of course. My chief scientist and his crew. I am their queen. You are going to be their king. You'll enjoy living on Scalos.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,What about my ship? My crew?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Deela,,"Oh, in a few of their moments, they will realise that you've vanished. They will look for you, but they will not find you. You're accelerated far beyond their power to see. So they'll go on without you. Don't be so stubborn. You cannot go back to them, ever. Is it so dreadful a prospect?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,draws his phaser,"This won't kill you, but the stun effect is not very pleasant."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Deela,,But that won't work. You go ahead and try. Point it right at me.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,,She sidesteps the slow phaser beam easily.,
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Deela,,"My reactions are much too fast for such a crude weapon. And I am quite good at self-defense, too. This can be set for stun and destroy, too, like yours. (his phaser goes flying) Please, accept what has happened. There is nothing you can do to change it."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,"If I agree to go with you, will you set this ship to rights? Take out that device in the life-support system?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Deela,,"Don't be so silly. You'll feel better about it all in a little while. It always happens this way. They are very upset at first, then it wears off and they, they learn to like it. You will, too."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,,Kirk leaves,
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Deela,,He's on his way to you. Be gentle with him.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,,"Meanwhile, in our normal time-frame",
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Uhura,,Captain. Captain Kirk! He's gone!
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,"Lieutenant, did you see what happened?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Uhura,,"Well, he was sitting there. He'd just drunk his coffee and set his cup down. You see it's still there. And then he vanished."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,"Mister Sulu, do you verify?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Sulu,,"That's just what happened. He was there, then all of a sudden he wasn't there."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,corridor,Compton,,"Captain Kirk, you've made it."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,corridor,Kirk,,"Compton, did they accelerate you?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,corridor,Compton,,"Yes, sir."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,corridor,Kirk,,They hooked something into the life support system. They're in there. We've got to get rid of it.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,corridor,Compton,,"I'm sorry, sir. Entry is forbidden."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,corridor,Kirk,,By whose order?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,corridor,Compton,,"The commander, sir. You'll have to step back, please."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,corridor,Kirk,,"I'm your commander, Compton. I order you to let me in."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,corridor,Compton,,"I'm sorry, sir. You are no longer."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,corridor,Kirk,,Who is? Deela? Is that who you're working for?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,corridor,Compton,,"At first I refused, but then after a while I found I couldn't help myself. I met this girl. She's one of them. I've never known anyone like her. She brought me aboard to show them operation of the ship. Bridge controls, life support. She explained that they wanted to know. I didn't understand at first, but I do now. So will you, sir."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,corridor,Kirk,,"All right, Compton."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,corridor,,"Kirk turns away, then quickly disarms Compton and enters",
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,,Two Scalosian males are there.,
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Rael,,Stun.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,,Kirk falls gently to the floor. Compton enters and attacks the man with the weapon. He is knocked down for his loyalty.,
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Rael,,You were ordered to stop him. Why did you disobey?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Compton,,I tried to stop him. You hurt him.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Rael,,He was violent. He had to be subdued.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Compton,,He was my captain.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Ekor,,Cell damage.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Rael,to a young woman,Another will be secured for you.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,"I'm getting a trace reading similar to that on the planet. Mister Sulu, did you drink your coffee?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Sulu,,Yes.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,Did anyone else?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Scott,,I had some.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,May I?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Scott,,"Was it the coffee? Are we going to go too, just like the captain?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,I cannot give you that answer until these have been analysed.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Scott,,By that time it'll be too late.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,"I suggest that we recall the captain's words, Make them take the next step. It would seem they have taken it. And we must determine effective countermeasures. Mister Scott, you have the conn. I shall be in the medical lab."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,,Deela is kneeling next to the still-unconscious Kirk.,
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Deela,,"I hate what happens to them when they're damaged. You're going to have to learn to control your temper, Rael. I do not want that to happen to this one. If they are so stubborn a species, perhaps they will last longer."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Rael,,It may be.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Deela,,I hope so. They all go so soon. I want to keep this one a long time. He's pretty.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Rael,,"He is inferior, Deela."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Deela,,Oh? I don't think so.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Rael,,You cannot allow yourself to feel an attachment to such.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Deela,,"I can allow myself anything I want. Oh, Rael, don't be like that. Am I jealous of what you do?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Rael,,I do my duty.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Deela,,So do I. And sometimes I allow myself to enjoy it.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,,Kirk wakes up.,
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Deela,,Hello.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Kirk,,What is that device doing on my ship?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Rael,,Deela will explain it.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Deela,,"I will tell you anything you want to know, and you'll approve of it."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Kirk,,Approve of it? We're your prisoners.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Deela,,Hardly. You're free to go anywhere you want to.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Rael,,"Go ahead, Captain. It is not yet completely linked to your support system, but it is in operating order. Study it if you wish. I suggest that you do not touch it."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,,"Kirk touches the device briefly, then clamps both hands firmly onto it in an act of defiance. Deela pulls them off.",
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Deela,,"He told you not to touch it. Look at your hands. They're almost frozen, aren't they? It will pass."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Rael,,"The unit has its own self-defence mechanism, as you see. You should've heeded me."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,,Kirk sees Compton on the floor. The young man now looks very old.,
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Rael,,"In your struggle with Compton, some of his cells were damaged. Those newly accelerated to our level are sensitive to cell damage. They age rapidly and die."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Kirk,,He was so young.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Rael,,Was.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Kirk,,This is what you have planned for us?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Deela,,"We all die, even on Scalos."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,,Kirk leaves.,
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Deela,,"Why did you lie to him? He did not damage that one, you did."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Rael,,Perhaps he will be less violent now.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Deela,,I see no reason to make him feel any worse than he has to.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Rael,,Why do you care what he feels?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Deela,,"Rael, he's not one of us. He's temporary. (getting a message via her collar device) He's gone to the medical laboratory. He's trying to communicate with the Vulcan. His species is capable of much affection."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Rael,,I have noted that.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Deela,,"I wonder if they will demonstrate it to us. Oh, Rael, stop sulking. Accept it. We've had to accept it all our lives. Don't make it worse."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,,Rael kisses Deela,
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Deela,,Go back to work.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,,"In fast time. Kirk is using a computer console whilst McCoy, Chapel and Spock are motionless at another bench, examining test results.",
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Kirk,,"Kirk to Spock, I have fed all the ascertainable facts into the computer banks."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,,Deela enters.,
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Deela,,"Go ahead. You won't accomplish anything, but it may be historically valuable."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Kirk,,"Hyperacceleration is the key. I have counted only five of them aboard, but they have taken over the ship, and we are under their control due to this acceleration. They are able to speed others up to their level, as they did Compton and me. Presumably, this is enslavement? Those so treated exist at this accelerated level, becoming docile eventually. But when"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Deela,,Damaged.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Kirk,,"Damaged, they age incredibly fast, as though accelerated living"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Deela,,Burns them out.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Kirk,,"Burns them out. Compton was burned out. The device attached to the life-support system produces an extreme, numbing cold. It is my belief that they are turning the Enterprise into a gigantic deep-freeze for purposes only the Scalosians know."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Deela,,Quite correct.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Kirk,,"The unit has a protective shield which does not allow any physical contact. I don't know how to destroy it, but its destruction is imperative."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Deela,,"The unit will be activated. By the time they hear this, it will be too late. You have remarkable reasoning powers, Captain. You were quite right in almost every assumption."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Kirk,,Why are you doing this?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Deela,,"Do you really want to know? In a little while it won't matter to you at all. You'll be quite happy about it, Just as Compton was."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Kirk,,I really want to know.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Deela,,"Oh, dear. You are so stubborn. It should be obvious to you that we're doing it because we have to. A long time ago, it is in our history, we used to be like you. Then our country was almost destroyed by volcanic eruptions. The water was polluted. Radiation was released. That changed us. It accelerated us. The children died. Most of the women found they could not have more. All of our men had become sterile. So we had to mate outside our own people. Whenever a spaceship came by, we'd send our calls for help. But accelerating them to our level burned them out. Don't you see, Captain? Do I have to go into every detail? We are going to take you down with us. Perhaps one or two others of your crew. We have to. We'll be kind to you. I wouldn't hurt you, certainly. I do like you."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Kirk,,What about the rest of my crew?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Deela,,"They'll remain here in suspended animation. It will do them no harm. We are saving them for when we need them in the future. You will not last forever. You know that, Captain. Captain, we have the right to survive."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Kirk,,Not by killing others.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Deela,,You were doing exactly the same thing. You came charging into that life-support room the minute you knew there was trouble. You would have killed every one my people if you could have.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Kirk,,You invaded my ship. You threaten my crew.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Deela,,There is no difference.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Kirk,,There is a difference! Your trouble is in you.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Deela,,We did not ask for it. We are not to blame. We are handling it the only way we know how. The way our parents and their parents before them.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Kirk,,"Did they solve anything? Have you tried any other way? Deela, have your scientists disconnect, destroy that unit. I promise you, we'll use every skill we have to help you. We'll move you to another planet. We'll call on the most brilliant minds in our Federation to help. We'll do it"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Deela,,"We have tried other ways. We've tried to make the transition to your level. Some of us, that is. Those who made the attempt died. We are trapped, Captain, Just as you are trapped now. I'm sorry for what's going to happen to you, but I cannot change it. You cannot change me."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Rael,,"Go to the transporter room, Deela. Signal me when you're there and beam down."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Deela,,With the captain?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Rael,,Yes. I'll activate our unit and follow you. I'm setting it to allow all of us time to get off the ship. Please don't delay.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,,"Meanwhile, Kirk slips his computer tape into the machine Spock is working at. Then he slips out.",
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Deela,,Just what makes you think I would do that? The captain's gone.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Rael,,"Go after him, Deela."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,,in real time,
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Mccoy,,"There's no question about it, Spock. I want you to take a look at this. The same substance is in the captain's coffee as in the Scalosian water, and there's no trace of it in any other cups."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,,Kirk removed a vital component from the control console before Deela enters. She draws her weapon.,
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,Deela,,Why did you run?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,Kirk,,I panicked.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,Deela,,I don't believe that.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,Kirk,,I'd like to leave before he activates the suspended animation device.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,Deela,into her comm. unit,We're in the transporter room. You can activate.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,Rael,,Beam him down at once.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,Deela,,Captain.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,,Kirk stands on the transporter pad. Deela activates the controls but nothing happens.,
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,Deela,,"What have you done to the transporter, Captain?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,Kirk,,It was working before. Try it again.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,Deela,into her comm. unit,The transporter isn't working.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Rael,,What'd he do to it?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,environmental engineering,Deela,,Nothing. He didn't have time.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,Deela,,"It must be a, what do you call it? A malfunction. You'd better not activate the unit yet. What would you say it is, Captain?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,Kirk,,The technicians reported a loss of power. That must be it.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,Deela,,The captain says his technicians
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,Rael,,I heard him. You expect me to believe him?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,Deela,,"I expect you to check into all possible causes. If I had a suspicious nature, Captain, I would say that you sabotaged the transporter to buy time."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,Kirk,,"Yes, of course."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,Deela,,"I'm glad we're both innocents. I despise devious people, don't you?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,transporter room,Kirk,,I believe in honest relationships myself.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Spock,,"Nurse, programme the information and determine whether we can find counteragents. (there's a buzz) Doctor, did you just"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Mccoy,,I've been hearing that whine ever since we beamed down to Scalos.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Spock,,"I know what it is. We brought it with us from Scalos. If you'll excuse me, I shall be on the bridge."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Deela,,"Your quarters are quite like you, Captain. Austere and efficient, and in their own way, handsome."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,A room should reflect its occupant.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Deela,,"Absolutely. May I freshen up? All this rushing about has left me windblown. I'm glad to see you allow yourself some comforts. Are you married, Captain? No family? No attachments? I know. You're married to your career, and you never look at another woman."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Well, if she's pretty enough, I'll look."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Deela,,I wondered when you'd say something nice to me. Am I more presentable now?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,A bit.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Deela,,It was quite delightful kissing you when you couldn't see me. But now
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,But now.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,,"He kisses her, then takes her hands but she dodges away. He was trying to get the weapon from her sleeve.",
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Deela,,No. I wouldn't allow you to take that no matter how much we trust each other. But I would've been disappointed if you hadn't tried.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Was I too crude?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Deela,,Just don't try it again. You're far too vulnerable to skin damage. All I have to do is scratch you.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Yes. I know.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Deela,,The difference between us is that you will come around to our way of thinking sooner or later. But it's better sooner than later.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,,Another kiss.,
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,"Lieutenant, will you replay the Scalosian distress call on my viewer?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."

68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,,Finally it is speeded up to the familiar buzz or whine the crew have been hearing.,

68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Kirk,,"This device attached to the life-support system produces an extreme, numbing cold. It is my belief that they are turning the Enterprise into a gigantic deep-freeze. The unit has protective shield which does not allow any physical contact. I don't know how to destroy it, but its destruction is imperative."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Deela,,"The unit will be activated. By the time they hear this, it will be too late."

68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Scott,,"Can we use phasers to cut through that wall, bypass the force field and get at that unit?"
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Spock,,"Mister Scott, we cannot cope with them on our level."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,bridge,Scott,,Can we find some way of coping with them on theirs?

68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,No.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Deela,,"How very fortunate for you, Rael. Don't you dare do anything like that again. It's contemptible."

68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Why are we here?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Deela,,Our leaving was delayed. Don't you remember? You damaged the transporter.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Oh, yes. That was wrong of me."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Deela,,"Yes, it certainly was."

68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Am I behaving incorrectly?
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Deela,,"No! I liked you better before. Stubborn and irritating and independent, like Rael."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Those are undesirable qualities.
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,kirk's quarters,Deela,,Maybe that's why I liked you so much. Because you were like him. (into comm.) Rael? You don't have to worry about the captain. He's made the adjustment.

68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Spock,,"Yes, it counteracts the substance most effectively."
68,3,Wink Of An Eye,medical lab,Mccoy,,"Most effectively under laboratory conditions, but the question is will it work in the human body? And the second question is, how do we get it to the captain?"

69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"I suggest no supernatural explanation, Captain. I merely point out that the facts do not fit any known categories of planets."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Kirk,,Let's take the facts one by one. That should explain something.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,Undoubtedly. The age of this planet would seem to be only a few thousand years. It would be impossible for vegetation to evolve in so short a period.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Kirk,,Its size is approximately that of Earth's moon.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,But its mass and atmosphere are similar to Earth.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Kirk,,That would be difficult to explain.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"It would be impossible, Captain. An atmosphere could not evolve in so short a period of time."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Kirk,,And yet it has.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,Evidently. But the inconsistencies are so compounded as to present a seemingly impossible phenomenon.

69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"Precisely, Captain."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Kirk,,"It would bear closer investigation, it would seem, if we're to provide Starfleet with an accurate report. Lieutenant, send Doctor McCoy to the transporter room for survey party. We'll also need Senior Geologist D'Amato."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, aye, sir."

69,3,That Which Survives,transporter room,Kirk,,"Yes. If Mister Spock is correct, you'll have a report to startle the Fifth Interstellar Geophysical Conference."
69,3,That Which Survives,transporter room,Mccoy,,"Why? What is it, Jim?"
69,3,That Which Survives,transporter room,Kirk,,A planet that even Spock can't explain. Prepare to transport. Energise.

69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,For one thing it means we're stranded.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,"The Enterprise must have blown up. That would explain the high radiation readings, wouldn't it, Captain? If the matter - antimatter engines"
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"Shall we stop guessing, Mister Sulu, and try and establish a pattern? I get no readings of high energy concentration. If the Enterprise had blown up, it would have left a high residual radiation."

69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Rahda,,"Yes, sir. They're wrong."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,Wrong?
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Rahda,,"Yes, Mister Spock. Look. Now here's a replay of the star pattern just before the explosion."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,A positional change.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Rahda,,It doesn't make any sense. But somehow I'd say that in a flash we've been knocked one thousand light years away from where we were.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"Nine hundred and ninety point seven light years to be exact, Lieutenant."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Scott,,But that's not possible. Nothing can do that.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"Mister Scott, since we are here, your statement is not only illogical but also unworthy of refutation. It is also illogical to assume that any explosion, even that of a small star going supernova, could have hurled us a distance of nine hundred and ninety point seven light years."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Scott,,"The point is, it shouldn't have hurled us anywhere. Why, it should have destroyed us immediately, vaporised us."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"That is correct, Mister Scott, by all the laws that we know. There was no period of unconsciousness. Our ship's chronometers registered a matter of only a few seconds. Therefore, we were displaced through space in some manner which I am unable to fathom."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Scott,,"What you're saying is that the planet didn't blow up, and the captain and the others, they're still alive!"

69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,Explain.
69,3,That Which Survives,mccoy's office,M'Benga,,It's as though every cell in the body had been individually blasted from inside.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,Would any known disease organism do that?
69,3,That Which Survives,mccoy's office,M'Benga,,"Doctor Sanchez has ruled that possibility out, sir."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"Please keep me fully advised. Spock out. He was in the transporter room. Someone may have entered after Captain Kirk and his party left. Mister Scott, since the Enterprise is obviously functional, I suggest we return to our starting place at top warp speed."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, sir. But even at that it'll take a while to get there."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"In that case, Mister Scott, I suggest we start at once. Can you give me warp eight?"
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, sir. And maybe a wee bit more. I'll sit on the warp engines myself and nurse them."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"That position, Mister Scott, would not only be unavailing but also undignified. Lieutenant Rahda, plot a course."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Rahda,,"Already plotted and laid in, sir."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,Good. Then prepare to come to warp eight.

69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"Yes. I don't see any water, but there must be some to grow the vegetation. A source of water would stretch our survival. Did you see any evidence of rainfall?"
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,D'Amato,,"No, sir. And I haven't seen any evidence that there ever has been any rainfall."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,But there is earth-type vegetation.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,Is it possible the vegetation could absorb the water directly from the air?
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"Yes, that's possible. There's also the possibility of underground water."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,D'Amato,,"Yes, sir. Could be."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Sulu's picked up an organism that's almost a virus, like a a plant parasite. It's the nearest biological form of life I can find."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"This apparently is going to be our home for as long as we last. I suggest we find out as much as we can about it. Split up. D'Amato, see if you can find underground water."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,D'Amato,,"Yes, sir."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"Sulu, run an atmospheric analysis."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,"Aye, sir."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"Bones, see if you can find out anything about the vegetation and your parasite. How do they get their moisture? If you can discover how they survive, maybe we can."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,,Sulu and D'Amato have headed off to do their analyses. Sulu contacts Kirk on his communicator,
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,Sulu to Captain.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,Kirk here.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,"Captain, I was making a standard magnetic sweep. From zero, I suddenly got a reading that was off the scale. Then, a reverse of polarity and now I get nothing. I've never seen anything like this reading. Like a door opened and then closed again."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,Kirk out.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,,"Elsewhere, D'Amato is wandering amongst the purple tipped vegetation and picking up handfuls of sand. He turns around and there is the woman.",
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Losira,,Do not be afraid.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,D'Amato,,I'm not. Geological disturbances don't frighten me. I've come here to study them. My specialty.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Losira,,"I know. You are Lieutenant D'Amato, Senior Geologist."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,D'Amato,,That's right. How did you know that?
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Losira,,From the spaceship Enterprise.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,D'Amato,,"Yes, and we're stranded here. You been talking to my friends?"
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Losira,,Do not be afraid.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,D'Amato,,I'm not afraid.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Losira,,"I am for you, Lieutenant D'Amato."

69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Losira,,I am only for D'Amato.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,D'Amato,,Lucky D'Amato. I want to have a conference about sharing your food and water.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Losira,,Do not call the others. Please.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,,"Somewhere else, McCoy gets out his communicator.",
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,McCoy to Kirk.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,Kirk here.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Jim, I just got a life form reading of tremendous intensity. Suddenly it was just there."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,What do you mean just there?
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Just that. All levels were normal, then I get this biological surge of life form registering. No, now it's gone."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,As though a door opened and closed.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,Yes.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,What direction?
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,Zero eight three.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"Hang on. D'Amato's section. Come in. Kirk to D'Amato. Come in. Come in. Bones, Sulu, D'Amato doesn't answer."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,I'll be right there.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,,Kirk arrives first. We see a pair of legs with boots lying face down behind a rock.,
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,Bones!
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,,McCoy runs in and examines the body.,
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Jim, every cell in his body's been disrupted."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,,Sulu arrives. Kirk adjusts his phaser.,
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Jim, what are you doing?"
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,Digging a grave.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,Poor D'Amato. What a terrible way to die.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"There are no good ways, Sulu."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,,"Kirk phasers the ground, but it only cuts a shallow trench in the soil.",
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,That's the same red rock.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,My phaser didn't cut through it.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Whatever it is, it has a mighty high melting point."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"Eight thousand degrees centigrade. It looks like igneous rock, but infinitely denser."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,,Adjusts his phaser and tries again.,
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,"This whole planet must be made up of this substance, covered over by top soil."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"Mister Sulu, it might explain this place a little better if we knew what the substance is. I know it was D'Amato's field, but see what you can find out."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,"Yes, sir."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Well, I guess a tomb of rocks is the best we can provide for D'Amato."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,Yeah. It might be the most suitable memorial at that.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,I wonder what killed him.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"I don't know, but something or someone did."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Rahda,,"We're holding warp eight point four, sir. If we can maintain it, our estimated time of arrival is eleven and one half solar hours."

69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,Scott to Bridge. Scott to Bridge.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,Spock here.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Scott,,"Mister Spock, the ship feels wrong."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"Feels, Mister Scott?"
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,"I know it doesn't make sense. Instrumentation reads correct, but the feel is wrong."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Scott,,It's something I can't quite put into words.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"That is obvious, Mister Scott. I suggest you avoid emotionalism and simply keep your instruments correct."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Spock,,Spock out.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,,"The cairn is complete, and topped off with a name-stone.",
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,It looks so lonely there.

69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,"Doctor, how can you joke about it?"
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,"I'm not joking. Until we know what killed him, none of us are safe."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,We've got to figure this out and devise a defence against it. Is it possible that the rocks have life?
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,"You remember on Janus Six, the silicon creatures"
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,But our instruments recorded that. They were life forms. They registered as life forms.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"Unless we're dealing with beings, intelligent beings who can shield themselves."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,Beings intelligent enough to have destroyed the Enterprise?
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"That's the problem, Sulu. We have only questions. No answers."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,,"Scott is trying to track down the source of his feeling, and a man in a red boiler suit keeps looking over his shoulder.",
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,"Watkins, check the bypass valve on the matter/antimatter reaction chamber. Make sure it's not overheating."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Watkins,,"But, Mister Scott, the board shows correct."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,"I didn't ask you to check the board, lad."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Watkins,,"Yes, sir."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,,Watkins goes off into an adjoining room and checks a console and some panels in there. Then he is confronted by Losira.,
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Watkins,,Who are you?
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Losira,,"My name is not important. Yours is Watkins, John B. Engineer Grade four."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Watkins,,You know all about me. I've never seen you before.
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Losira,,Show me this unit. I wish to learn.
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Watkins,,This is the matter-antimatter integrator control. That's the cut off switch.
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Losira,,"Not correct. That is the emergency overload bypass, which engages almost instantaneously. A wise precaution, considering it takes the antimatter longer to explode once the magnetic flow fails. I am for you, Mister Watkins."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Watkins,,"Mister Scott, there's a strange woman who knows the entire plan of the Enterprise."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,,"But by the time Scott gets there, Watkins has screamed and Losira has turned sideways into a vertical line, then vanished.",
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,"Oh, you poor lad. Scott to bridge. Scott to bridge."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,Spock here.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Scott,,"My assistant, Watkins, is dead."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"Do you know what he died of, Mister Scott?"
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Scott,,"I didn't see it happen, but his last words were a warning cry about some strange woman."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"Security alert, all decks. Female intruder, extremely dangerous. Security alert. All decks."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,,"Dusk is falling, the sky is a dark purple.",
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Narrator,,KIRK; Conclusions.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,The basic substance of this planet is an alloy of diburnium-osmium. It couldn't have evolved naturally.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Captain, it doesn't make sense. In fact, nothing about this planet makes sense."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"Except for a momentary fluctuation on your instruments, this planet has no magnetic field. The apparent age of these rocks is only a few thousand years. No known process could evolve the plant life they have here in that short space of time."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,Are you suggesting this might be an artificial planet?
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,"But Captain, where are the people who made it? Why can't we see them?"
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,The planet might be hollow. They might be shielding themselves from our sensor probes. It's dark. Let's get some rest. Tomorrow we have to find some food and some water or it's going to be a very unpleasant stay.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,While it lasts.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,"I'll take the first watch, sir."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,All right. Take D'Amato's tricorder. Set it for automatic distress. You never can tell.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,"Aye, sir."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,,"Sulu sets up the tricorder on a rock ledge, and leaves it beeping away to itself.",
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"Spock to Sickbay. Have you completed the autopsy on Watkins, Doctor?"
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,M'Benga,,"Yes, we have, Mister Spock."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,Was the cause of his death the same as that which killed the transporter officer?
69,3,That Which Survives,mccoy's office,M'Benga,,"Well, the pattern of cellular disruption was the same, but as to the cause, well your guess is as good as mine."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"My guess, Doctor, would be valueless. I suggest we refrain from guessing and find some facts."
69,3,That Which Survives,mccoy's office,Spock,,Spock out.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"The power of this intruder to disrupt every cell in a body, combined with the almost inconceivable power required to hurl the Enterprise such a distance, speak of a very high culture and a very great danger."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Scott,,You mean that one of the people who threw us a thousand light years away from that planet is on board and killing our people?
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"A reasonable assumption, Mister Scott."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Scott,,"Then you're right, Mister Spock. Watkins must've been murdered. I sent him in to check the matter-antimatter reactor. There are no exposed circuits there. It couldn't have been anything he touched."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"If there are more of those beings on that planet, the captain and the others are in very great danger."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,,"While Kirk and McCoy sleep, Losira turns off the tricorder. Sulu confronts her.",
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Losira,,I am unarmed.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,Who are you?
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Losira,,That is not important. You are Lieutenant Sulu. You were born on the planet Earth. You're helmsman for the Enterprise.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,How do you know this? Where did you get this information? Are you from this planet?
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Losira,,I am from here.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,Then the planet is hollow. Who killed Lieutenant D'Amato? All right. The captain will want to talk to you. That way. Move!
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Losira,,You do not understand. I have come for you.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,What do you want?
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Losira,,I want to touch you.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,You were on the Enterprise. Keep back! Stop or I'll shoot! I don't want to have to kill a woman.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,,"Sulu fires his phaser at her feet, then at her. It has no effect.",
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,Captain Kirk! Captain Kirk!
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,,"As he backs away, Sulu falls over a stone. Losira manages to brush his shoulder before he gets away, screaming in pain, and Kirk steps in front of her.",
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,Hold it! Who are you?
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Losira,,I am for him. I am for Lieutenant Sulu.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,"Don't let her touch you, Captain! That's how D'Amato died. Phasers won't stop her."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Losira,,"I am for Lieutenant Sulu. Please, I must touch him."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,,"She puts her hand on Kirk's shoulder, but it doesn't hurt him. He pushes her away.",
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,How can you destroy others and not me?
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Losira,,I don't want to destroy. I don't want to.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,Who are you? Why are you trying to kill us?
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Losira,,Only Sulu. I mean you no harm.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,Are there men on this planet?
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Losira,,"Please, I must touch him. I am for Lieutenant Sulu."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,No!
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,,"Losira goes two-dimensional, then vanishes.",
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"Bones, did you see that? Maybe Spock was wrong. Perhaps this is a ghost planet."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Well, all I know is she almost made a ghost out of Sulu. His shoulder, where she touched it, every cell's been disrupted. Exploded from within. If she'd really gotten a good grip on him, Jim."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,"How can such people be, Captain? Such evil and she's so, so beautiful."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"Yes, I know."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Uhura,,"Security sweeps of all decks are negative, Mister Spock. No evidence of intruder."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,Very well. Cancel Red Alert but maintain increased security.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir. All decks, cancel Red Alert. Maintain increased security."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"Please update our subspace report to Starfleet to include security search, results negative."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Uhura,,"How did she get off the ship, sir?"
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,Presumably the same way she got on.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir. Mister Spock what are the chances of the captain and the others being alive?"
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"Lieutenant, we are not engaged in gambling. We are proceeding in the only logical way to return to the place they were last seen, and factually ascertain whether or not they still live."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, Mister Spock."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Rahda,,"Mister Spock, speed is increased to warp eight point eight."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Scott,,Bridge to Engineering.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Scott,,Scotty here. I see it.
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,It's a power surge. I'm working on it. Reduce speed until I locate the trouble.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,Very well. Reduce speed to warp seven.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Rahda,,"Aye, sir. Warp seven. Mister Spock, our speed has increased to warp eight point nine and still climbing."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,Bridge to Engineering. Negative effect on power reduction. Speed is still increasing.
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,"Aye, Mister Spock, and I found out why. The emergency bypass control of the matter-antimatter integrator is fused."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Scott,,It's completely useless. The engines are running wild. There's no way to get at them. We should reach maximum overload in about fifteen minutes.
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"I would calculate fourteen point eight seven minutes, Mister Scott."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,"Those few seconds will not make any difference, Mister Spock, because you and I and the rest of the crew will no longer be here to bandy it back and forth."
69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Scott,,This thing is going to blow up
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,And there's nothing in the universe can stop it.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,There's a layer of necrotic tissue a few cells thick. A normal wound would heal quickly.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,She just touched me. How could it happen so fast?
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"That's a good question. She touched the transporter chief. He collapsed immediately. She apparently got to D'Amato. We saw what happened to him. The question is, why are you alive?"
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,"Captain, I'm happy the way it turned out."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,"Jim, what kind of power must she have?"
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,The power to totally disrupt biological cell structure. Sulu's alive because I intervened. But that raises an even worse question.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,Yes. Why didn't she kill you?
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,She's not through yet.
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,,Scott is working on the emergency bypass,
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,It's useless. And there's no question it's deliberate.
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Spock,,Sabotage.
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,"Aye, and a thorough job. The system's foolproof. Whoever murdered Watkins sabotaged this."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Spock,,You said it was fused. How?
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,That's what worries me.
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Spock,,"Worries, Mister Scott?"
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,"Well, it's fused, all right, but it would take all the power of our main phaser banks to do it."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Spock,,Interesting.
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,I find nothing interesting in the fact that we're about to blow up.
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Spock,,"No, but the method is fascinating."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,Whatever did this is still aboard this ship. I fail to understand why you cancelled the security alert.
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Spock,,A force that could hurl us nine hundred and ninety point seven light years away and at that distance still be able to sabotage our main source of energy will not be waiting around to be taken into custody.
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,Aye.
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Spock,,"As I recall the pattern of our fuel flow, there is an access tube leading to the matter-antimatter reaction chamber."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,"There's a service crawlway, but it's not meant to be used while the integrator operates."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Spock,,"Still, it is there, and it might be possible to shut off the fuel at that point."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,What with? Bare hands?
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Spock,,A magnetic probe.
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,Any matter that comes in contact with antimatter triggers the explosion. And I'm not even sure a man can live in the crawlway in the energy stream of the magnetic field that bottles up the antimatter.
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Spock,,I shall try.
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,"You'll be killed, man!"
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Spock,,"Unless a solution is found quickly, that fate awaits all of us."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,"Aye. You're right. What have we got to lose? But I'll do it, Mister Spock. I know every millimetre of that system. I'll do whatever has to be done."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Spock,,"Very well, Mister Scott. You spoke of the feel of the ship being wrong."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,Aye. It was an emotional statement. I don't expect you to understand it.
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Spock,,"I note it, Mister Scott, without necessarily understanding it. I propose to run an analysis through the ship's computers, comparing the present condition of the Enterprise with her ideal condition."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Scott,,"Mister Spock, we don't have time for that."
69,3,That Which Survives,engineering,Spock,,"We have twelve minutes and twenty seven seconds. I suggest you do whatever you can in the service crawlway, while I make the computer study."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"Lieutenant Sulu, do you feel strong enough to move about?"
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,"I feel fine, Captain."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"Is he, Bones?"
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Mccoy,,He's in fair shape.
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"All right. Whatever destructive power this woman has seems to be aimed at one specific person at one specific time. If I'm correct, when she re-appears, the other two might protect the one she's after by interposing their bodies. No weapons seem to affect her."
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Sulu,,"But Captain, how does she know about us? Does she read our minds? (there's a whining sound) Phaser on overload!"
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,Controls are fused. Drop!
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,,"He throws his phaser away, and it goes off with a big bang.",
69,3,That Which Survives,planet surface,Kirk,,"Apparently she can destroy our weapons as well as destroy us. Come on, let's go."
69,3,That Which Survives,bottom of crawlway,Scott,,"All right, lads. Get the crawlway door open. Hand me the tools. Communicator. All right. Head first. I hope Mister Spock knows what he's doing."

69,3,That Which Survives,crawlway,Rahda,,"Mister Spock, we're at warp eleven point two and accelerating."
69,3,That Which Survives,crawlway,Scott,,I heard that. The ship's not structured to take that speed for any length of time.

69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,"Mister Scott, what is your situation?"
69,3,That Which Survives,crawlway,Scott,,It's hard to see. There's so much disturbance that any attempt to get at the flow would rupture the magnetic field.

69,3,That Which Survives,bridge,Spock,,Please commence. I'll explain.
69,3,That Which Survives,crawlway,Spock,,You were correct in your feel. The Enterprise was put through a molecular transporter and reassembled slightly out of phase. Reverse polarity should seal the incision.

69,3,That Which Survives,room,Kirk,,Returned from where?

69,3,That Which Survives,room,Kirk,,"Was, Mister Spock. Its defences were run by computer."

After your long journey, I'm sorry to give you only a recorded welcome, but we who have guarded the outpost for you will be dead by the time you take possession of this planet. I am the last of our advanced force left alive. Too late the physicians discovered the cause of this sickness that kills us. In creating this planet, we have accidentally produced a deadly organism. I have awaited the regular supply ship from home for medical assistance, but I doubt now whether it will arrive in time. I will set the outpost controls on automatic. The computer will selectively defend against all life forms but our own. My fellow Kalandans, I, Losira, wish you well."
69,3,That Which Survives,room,Mccoy,,"The previous ships probably spread the disease all through their people. The supply ship that she was waiting for never came. All these thousands of years, she's been waiting to greet people who were dead."
69,3,That Which Survives,room,Spock,,"To do the job of defence, the computer projected a replica of the only image available. Losira's."
69,3,That Which Survives,room,Kirk,,"The computer was too perfect. It projected so much of Losira's personality into the replica that it felt regret, guilt, at killing. That bought us the time we needed to destroy it. She must have been a remarkable woman."
69,3,That Which Survives,room,Mccoy,,And beautiful.

70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Kirk,,"Bones, if you're satisfied that the mutation theory is applicable, I'll make a note of it in my report."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Unless we get more information from him, it'll have to serve."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,,Intercom whistle,
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Kirk,,Kirk here.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Chekov,,"Captain, contact with alien ship, sir."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Kirk,,I'll be right there. Notify Mister Spock.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Put the ship on the viewing screen, Mister Sulu. Magnification. Still nothing, Mister Chekov."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Chekov,,"I verify, sir, it's out there."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Maximum magnification. I draw a blank, Mister Spock. Your response?"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,"Negative, Captain."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Chekov,,"No malfunction, sir. The reading persists."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,What is it?
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,"There is a vessel out there, Captain."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,Could it be a Romulan ship using their cloaking device?
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,"Negative. This would not be a Romulan vessel. It is totally alien in configuration. Motive power unknown. Small size of the craft indicates a rapid scout vessel, one or two-man crew."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, I've tried all hailing frequencies. Negative, sir."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Weaponry on the vessel, Spock?"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,Nothing identifiable. The craft appears to be built for speed rather than combat.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,Something out there can't be seen. Explanation?
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,"None. Completely elusive. In fact, it's invisible."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,Invisible. Malfunction?
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,There is no sensor failure. The readings persist.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Chekov,,It's headed straight for us!
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,Evasive action.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Chekov,,"It shifts with us, sir. And we're pushing to the limit!"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Deflector shields activated, Mister Sulu."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Sulu,,"Automatic, sir."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Chekov,,We're on collision course.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Sulu,,It's out of control or a suicide mission.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,Sound warning for collision. Red Alert.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Sulu,,Brace yourself for collision. Brace yourself.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,,Nothing happens.,
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Read out, Mister Spock."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,It just disintegrated. Fascinating.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,What is it now?
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,"It is gone now, Captain, but it seems to have deposited an alien presence."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,Where?
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,"Right here, Captain."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,,"By the turbolift doors is a man, white on the left side, black on the right.",
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Explain, Spock. One of a kind?"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,I am Bele.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Of the planet Cheron, no doubt."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,Forgive my unorthodox arrival.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,Your mode of travel was also unorthodox. Secure from Red Alert. What happened to your vehicle?
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,"It served me long and durably. Unfortunately, the strain of arduous pursuit has exceeded even its advanced qualities. I was just able to complete this trip and disembark in time, or I would have disintegrated in space with it."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,A most unique craft. Pity it couldn't be salvaged for our study.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,Yes. It was sheathed in special materials that rendered it invisible.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,What brings you to us?
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,"You bear precious cargo, Lokai. He has taken refuge aboard this ship. I am here to claim him."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,All personnel aboard this vessel are subject to my command. No one claims anyone without due process.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,"My apologies, Captain. I overstepped my powers. Claim is undoubtedly an unfortunate word."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,What is your authorisation? From what source?
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,"I am chief officer of the Commission on Political Traitors. Lokai was tried and convicted of treason, but had escaped. May I see him, please?"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"He's in Sickbay. Remember, since you're aboard the Enterprise, you're bound by its regulations."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,"With your permission, Captain."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,Mister Spock.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Bele,,"Well, Lokai, it's a pleasure to see you again. This time I'm sure our joining will be of a more permanent nature. Captain, you are to be congratulated. Never before has Lokai been rendered so quiescent."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Lokai,,"I will not return to Cheron with him, to a land of murdering oppressors!"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Kirk,,I told you where you were going. I allowed your fellow countryman here simply as a courtesy.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Bele,,"And you see how this killer repays you, as he repays all his benefactors."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Lokai,,"Benefactors? He's a liar. He raided our homes, tore us from our families, herded us together like cattle and then sold us as slaves!"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Bele,,"They were savages, Captain. We took them into our hearts, our homes. We educated them."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Lokai,,"Yes, just education enough to serve the master race."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Bele,,You were the product of our love! And you repaid us with murder.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Lokai,,Why should a slave show mercy to the enslaver?
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Bele,,Slaves? That was changed thousands of years ago. You were freed.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Lokai,,Freed? Were we free to be men? Free to be husbands and fathers? Free to live our lives in equality and dignity?
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Bele,,"Yes, you were free, if you knew how to use your freedom. You were free enough to slaughter and to burn all the things that had been built!"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Lokai,,I tried to break the chains of a hundred million people. My only crime is that I failed. To that I do plead guilty.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Bele,,There is an order in things. He asked for utopia in a day. It can't be done.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Lokai,,"Not in a day. And not in ten times ten thousand years by your thinking. To you, we are a loathsome breed who will never be ready. Genocide for my people is the plan for your utopia."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Bele,,"You insane, you filthy little plotter of ruin. You vicious subverter of every decent thought. Oh, you're coming back to pay for your crimes!"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Lokai,,"I know you and all those with whom you're plotting to take power permanently. When I return to Cheron, you will understand what power is. I will have armies of followers."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Kirk,,"It's now very clear you know each other extremely well, gentlemen. The only service this ship can offer is to bring you together. It is not a battlefield."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Lokai,,"Captain, I led revolutionaries, not criminals. I demand political asylum. This ship is a sanctuary."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Kirk,,"I'll tell you once more. For you, this ship is a prison."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Bele,,"Captain, it is imperative that you return Lokai to Cheron for judgment."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Kirk,,"Commissioner, Cheron is not a member of the Federation. No treaties have ever been signed. Your demand for possession of this prisoner cannot be honoured. There are no extradition procedures to allow it. Is that clear, Commissioner Bele?"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Bele,,"Captain, I hope you will be sensible."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Kirk,,How do you mean?
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Bele,,Co-operation.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Kirk,,I cannot take sides.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Bele,,"Since I am without a vessel to return to Cheron, I insist that you take us there immediately."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Kirk,,"Impossible. I have a mission to accomplish. There's a planet to be decontaminated. Millions of lives are at stake. Once that has been completed, I'll return to Starbase Four and turn you both over to the authorities. You can make your case to them."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Bele,,"I am sorry, Captain. That will not be satisfactory, not at all satisfactory."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Kirk,,"Commissioner, as a visiting dignitary from a far planet, I offer you every hospitality aboard this ship. Choose any other course,"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Bele,,You're the captain.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Kirk,,"Yes, I am. I think we can consider your problem settled. At least for the present. I have ordered guest quarters for you on deck six."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,,Bele leaves with a security escort.,
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Kirk,,"And I suggest you get a great deal of rest, especially your vocal chords. It seems you'll have a double opportunity to practise your oratory on Starbase Four."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Chekov,,Chekov to Captain Kirk. Chekov to Captain Kirk. Urgent.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Kirk,,Kirk here.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Chekov,,"Captain, we're off course."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Kirk,,"Well, get back on course."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Chekov,,"That's just it, sir. The ship's taken a new heading all by itself."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Kirk,,I'll be right there.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,Have you located the malfunction?
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Sulu,,"No, sir. The ship is unresponsive. We're moving away from Ariannus."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Explanation, Mister Spock?"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,"Elusive, Captain. I am investigating."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Sulu,,I can't understand it. I simply have no control.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,Kirk to engineering.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Scott,,Scott here.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Scotty, we're suddenly off course. Check our manoeuvering controls."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,engineering,Scott,,"Aye, sir. Hold. Captain, no malfunction indicated."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,engineering,Kirk,,Switch to auxiliary.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,engineering,Scott,,"Aye, sir. Out. (presses a lot of buttons.) Engineer to bridge."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,Kirk here.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Scott,,"On auxiliary, sir."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Stand by for check. Scotty, we're still off course."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Scott,,I'll be right up.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Speed, Mister Chekov."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Chekov,,We're moving at warp eight.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,And new course?
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Chekov,,four oh three mark seven. Straight for the Coal Sack if there is no letup.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant Uhura, put the ship on Red Alert. All hands, this is the captain. The ship is on Red Alert."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,engineering,Kirk,,"Repeat, the ship is on Red Alert. There has been an unidentified malfunction in the ship's directional control."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,Kirk,,"Repeat, the ship is off course and out of our control."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,sickbay,,"As the guard heads off to his battle station, Lokai dashes out of Sickbay.",
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,,Scott enters.,
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Our new heading, Mister Chekov?"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Chekov,,Four oh three mark seven.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,Spock?
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,"Confirmed, Captain. Holding pattern. Co-ordinates now indicate we are charting course to (pause) Captain, Cheron lies between four oh three mark seven and mark nine."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,,Bele enters,
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,"We're on the way to Cheron. Captain, this ship is now under my direction. For fifty thousand of your terrestrial years, I have been pursuing Lokai through the galaxy. I have not travelled this far, this long, only to give him up. This ship goes where my will drives it."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Scott,,"Captain, we are now at warp ten and the speed is increasing!"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,,Lokai enters,
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, course is now clearly straight for Cheron, despite all efforts to direct us to Ariannus."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Lokai,,"I will not return to Cheron. Captain, you must guarantee me sanctuary."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,"He cannot help you now. You are lost, Lokai. You're on the way to judgment, to final punishment."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Lokai,,Stop him.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,You evil mound of filth. Not this time.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Lokai,,My cause is just. You must help me. All of you must help me.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,"Oh, the old cry. Pity me, pity me. Everywhere he's gone, he's been helped to escape. On every planet he's found fools who bleed for him and shed tears for the oppressed one. But there is no escape for you on this ship. This is your last sanctuary."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Lokai,,Kill him. Kill him!
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,You're two of a kind.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,And we are both going to Cheron. You cannot change the course of this ship any more than you can change me. This ship goes where I want it to go.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Security, put them both in the brig."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,,The security guards are held back by forcefields.,
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,Phasers on stun. Fire. (no effect)
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,"Your phasers are ineffective against our shields. You are helpless, Captain."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Lokai,,"What a fool I am, expecting help from someone like you."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,This ship is going to Ariannus.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,"No, this ship is going to Cheron. I will let nothing interfere."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,We are going to Ariannus. The lives of a billion people make no other choice possible.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,"You are being obtuse, Captain. I am permitting no choice. My will now controls this, and nothing can break it."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Bele, I am captain of this ship, and it will follow whatever course I set for it, or I will order its destruction."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,You're bluffing.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,I will destroy it.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,You can no more destroy this ship than I can change colour.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant Uhura, tie in the bridge to the master computer."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."

70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, has the ship returned to the course set for it by my orders?"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,"Negative, Captain. We are still headed directly for Cheron."

70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, is this ship headed for Ariannus?"

70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Let me reaffirm my position, gentlemen. I could put you in the brig for what you have done, but I won't do it because you are new to this part of the galaxy, which is governed by the United Federation of Planets. We live in peace with full exercise of individual rights. The need to resort to violence and force has long since passed, and it will not be tolerated aboard this ship. You are free to move about the ship. I hope that you'll take the opportunity to know more about the Federation through its best representatives, my crew. But let me make it clear. I will stand for no interference with the function of this ship. All hands, return to normal routine. Captain out."

70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Lokai,,"Yes, well, I have learned to wait for actions. After Ariannus, what is justice? I shall wait to see it dispensed."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,,Lokai leaves,
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,Fascinating. Two irrevocably hostile humanoids.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Scott,,Disgusting is what I call them.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,That description is not scientifically accurate.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Scott,,"Mister Spock, the word disgusting describes exactly what I feel about those two."

But believe me, my friends, there can be no moment when I can have my guard down where such as Bele is present. So what happens? I act the madman out of the anger and frustration he forces upon me, and thereby prove his point that I am a madman."

You see, you are from the planet Earth. There is no persecution on your planet. How can you understand my fear, my apprehension, my degradation, my suffering?"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,rec room,Chekov,,There was persecution on Earth once. I remember reading about it in my history class.

How can I make your flesh know how it feels to see all those who are like you, and only because they are like you, despised, slaughtered, and even worse, denied the simplest bit of decency that is a living being's right? Do you know what it would be like to be dragged out of your hovel into a war on another planet? A battle that will serve your oppressor and bring death to you and your brothers?"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Bele,,"Putting the matter into the hands of your Starfleet Command is, of course, the proper procedure. How long will it be before we hear from them, Captain?"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Kirk,,I expect the answer is already on its way.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Bele,,"Well, then, let us drink to their wise solution to our problem."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Kirk,,Let's do that.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Spock,,"Commissioner, Starfleet Command may not arrive at the solution you anticipate. There is the matter of the shuttlecraft which Lokai appropriated. The interrogation of that matter may be of paramount importance to Starfleet."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Bele,,"Gentlemen, we are discussing a question of degree. Surely, stealing a shuttlecraft cannot be equated with the importance of murdering thousands of people."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Spock,,We do not know that Lokai has done that.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Bele,,One thing we are agreed on is that Lokai is a criminal.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Kirk,,"No, Commissioner. The one thing we're agreed upon is that Lokai took a shuttlecraft."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,,Intercom whistle,
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Kirk,,Excuse me.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Uhura,,Uhura to Captain Kirk.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Kirk,,Kirk here.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Uhura,,"I have a communication from Starfleet Command, sir."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Kirk,,"Yes, read it."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Uhura,,Starfleet Command extends greetings to Commissioner Bele of the planet Cheron. His urgent request to be transported to his planet with the man he claims prisoner has been taken under consideration.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Uhura,,"It is with great regret that we cannot honour that request. Intergalactic treaty clearly specifies that no being can be extradited without due process. In view of the circumstances, we have no doubt that after a hearing at Starbase, Commissioner Bele will be permitted to retain his prisoner and be provided transportation"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Kirk,,That's enough. Thank you.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Bele,,"As always, Lokai has managed to gain allies."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Kirk,,"Now, wait a minute, Commissioner,"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Bele,,"Even if they don't recognise themselves as being such. Yes, he will evade, delay, and escape again and in the process put thousands of innocent beings at each other's throats, getting them to kill and maim for a cause which they have no stake in, but which he will force them to violently espouse by twisting their minds with his lies, his loathsome accusations and his foul threats."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Kirk,,"I can assure you, Commissioner, that our minds will not be twisted, not by Lokai, nor by you."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Bele,,It is obvious to the most simpleminded that Lokai is of an inferior breed.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Spock,,"The obvious visual evidence, Commissioner, is that he is of the same breed as yourself."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Bele,,"Are you blind, Commander Spock? Well, look at me. Look at me!"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Kirk,,You're black on one side and white on the other.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Bele,,I am black on the right side.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Kirk,,I fail to see the significant difference.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Bele,,Lokai is white on the right side. All of his people are white on the right side.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Spock,,"Commissioner, perhaps the experience of my own planet Vulcan may set an example of some value to you. Vulcan was in danger of being destroyed by the same conditions and characteristics which threaten to destroy Cheron. We were once a people like yourselves, wildly emotional, often committed to irrationally opposing points of view, leading, of course, to death and destruction. Only the discipline of logic saved my planet from extinction."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Bele,,"Commander Spock, I am delighted that Vulcan was saved, but you cannot expect Lokai and people like him to act with self-discipline any more than you can expect a planet to stop orbiting its sun."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Kirk,,"Let Lokai state his grievances. Hear him, listen to him. Maybe he can change. Maybe he wants to change his image."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Bele,,He cannot change.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Spock,,"Change is the essential process of all existence. For instance, the people of Cheron must have once been mono-coloured."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Bele,,You mean like both of you?
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Kirk,,"There must have been a time, long ago no doubt, when that was true."

70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Bele,,I once heard that on some of your planets people believe they are descended from apes.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,captain's mess,Spock,,The actual theory is that all life-forms evolved from the lower levels to the more advanced stages.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Scott,,Ready for decontamination procedure.

70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,"Trouble, Mister Chekov?"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Chekov,,"I don't rightly know, Mister Spock. I was trying to programme for Starbase Four as ordered. I can't get a response."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Uhura,,"It just seemed to go dead, sir."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, some of the memory banks of the computer are burned out."

70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"At the moment, I seem to have no choice."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Lokai,,"So this is justice after Ariannus! You have signed my death warrant. I warned you what to expect. Will you continue to let this mockery of justice go on? If you are partisans of justice, prove it! Kill him!"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Chekov,,We are not killers.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Lokai,,"What do you do, carry justice on your tongues? You will beg for it, but you won't fight or die for it."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"After so many years of leading the fight, you seem very much alive."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,I doubt that the same can be said for many of his followers.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,"You're finished, Lokai! We've got your kind penned in on Cheron into little districts, and it's not going to change. You've combed the galaxy and come up with nothing but mono-coloured trash, do-gooders and bleeding hearts. You're dead, you half-white!"

70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,"If you listen to his legalistic trickery, I shall have to destroy this ship and everybody aboard."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,I understand. Will you return the Enterprise to my control?

70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Chekov, put it on the screen. Extreme magnification. What are you picking up?"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,"Several large cities, uninhabited. Extensive traffic systems, barren of traffic. Lower animal sand vegetation encroaching on the cities. No sapient life-forms registering at all, Captain. There is no evidence of natural disaster, yet there are vast numbers of unburied corpses in all cities."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"You mean, all the people are dead?"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,"All dead, Captain. They have annihilated each other totally."

70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Lokai,,No one alive?
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,"None at all, sir."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Bele,,Your band of murderers did this.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Lokai,,Your genocidal maniacs did this!
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,,They attack each other again.,
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,Stop it! What's the matter with you two? Didn't you hear Spock? Your planet is dead! There's nobody alive on Cheron because of hate. The cause you fought about no longer exists. Give yourselves time to breathe. Give up your hate. You're welcome to live with us. Listen to me. You both must end up dead if you don't stop hating.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Lokai,,You're an idealistic dreamer.

70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, I have located them on ship's sensors. Bele is chasing Lokai on deck three. Bele is passing recreation room three, approaching the crewmen's lounge. Lokai is running past the crewmen's lounge. Lokai has just arrived on deck five. Passing recreation room three."

70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,"Spock, anyone in the transporter room?"
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,"Negative, Captain. Transporter room is clear. However, there is a life-form materialising on the planet. It is Lokai. He is back on Cheron."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,There's nobody there to try him. His judges are all dead.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, the transporter mechanism has been activated again."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Kirk,,Of course.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,"It is Bele, Captain. And another life-form has appeared on Cheron."
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Uhura,,It doesn't make any sense.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,To expect sense from two mentalities of such extreme viewpoints is not logical.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Sulu,,But their planet's dead. Does it matter now which one's right?
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Spock,,Not to Lokai and Bele. All that matters to them is their hate.
70,3,Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,bridge,Uhura,,"Do you suppose that's all they ever had, sir?"

71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Cory,,"Gentlemen, you don't know what a treat this is for me. It's been too long since I've had company. The force field's back in place now. That means you two are trapped here, and I'm not accepting any excuses for your not dining with me."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,We'd be delighted.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Spock,,"Governor, you indicated one additional inmate since our last visit, making a total of fifteen. Is that correct?"

71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,"Why, Donald, are you becoming a pessimist?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Cory,,I'm afraid I have.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Spock,,A total of fifteen incurably insane out of billions is not what I would call an excessive figure. Who is the new inmate?

71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Kirk,,Release him.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Garth,,I'm afraid that subjugating you won't be enough. You must be confined. And all the people of the galaxy who will not bow to my will must be confined or destroyed.

71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Kirk,,Thank you. Now what have you done with the medicine?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Garth,,The medicine? You mean the poison. I destroyed it.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Kirk,,Destroyed it? It was your only hope.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Garth,,"Silence! The chatter of inferior weaklings wearies me, and it's time I took command of the Enterprise. You'll help me, of course."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Kirk,,Of course.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Garth,,My crew mutinied. The first use I will make of the Enterprise is to hunt them down and punish them for that.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Kirk,,The crew of the Enterprise will also mutiny.

71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Cory,,"All right. There is no help for any of us if that madman is in command of the Enterprise. He boasts that he's created the most powerful explosive in the universe, and I believe him."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Kirk,,How does he manage to change form at will?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Cory,,"The people of Antos taught him the techniques of cellular metamorphosis to restore the destroyed parts of his body. By himself, he later learned to use the technique to recreate himself into any form he wished. The first time we knew about it was when a guard, seeing what he thought was me in Garth's cell, released him."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Kirk,,He was such a genius. What a waste.

71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Mccoy,,Something's wrong.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Scott,,"Using the chess problem was the Captain's own suggestion. He couldn't have forgotten it, and I can't believe he was testing me. Lieutenant, re establish communication."

71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Scott,,Send an armed detail to the transporter room immediately.

71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Scott,,"Mister Sulu, what do your sensors show?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Sulu,,"We can't beam anybody down, sir. The force field on the planet is in full operation, and all forms of transport into the asylum dome are blocked off."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Scott,,"We could blast our way through the field, but only at the risk of destroying the Captain, Mister Spock and any other living thing on Elba Two."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Mccoy,,How can we be powerful enough to wipe out a planet and still be so helpless?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Garth,,"We are going to take the Enterprise, do you hear me? We are going to take her if I have to shatter every bone in Captain Kirk's body."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Garth,,"Captain? Captain Kirk? Well, I hope you haven't been too uncomfortable, Captain."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Kirk,,"Thank you for your concern. All in all, it's been rather restful."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Garth,,"Good. Still, I've been quite remiss in my duties as your host. I did invite you down to dinner, as you may recall."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Kirk,,I'd forgotten.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Garth,,But I haven't. You and Mister Spock are to be my guests.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Kirk,,Where is Mister Spock?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Garth,,Right here. Marta!
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,,"Spock enters with Marta, the Andorian and the Tellarite",
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Marta,,Why can't I blow off just one of his ears?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Garth,,"Stop that, Marta. Mister Spock will think we're lacking in hospitality. Won't you join us, Captain?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,,He lets Kirk out of the cell,
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Kirk,,"How are you, Mister Spock?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Spock,,"Very well indeed, thank you, Captain."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Kirk,,Isn't Governor Cory joining us?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Garth,,"No, the governor doesn't seem to be on the guest list."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Kirk,,An oversight?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Garth,,An intentional one. The governor's fasting.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Kirk,,"In that case, we must decline with thanks."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Garth,draws a weapon,Captain.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Cory,,"Don't be a fool, Jim. Go along with him."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Garth,,"Good advice, Governor. Well, Captain? You'll find we set a handsome table, and the entertainment is most enjoyable."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Kirk,,You're very persuasive.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,detention area,Garth,,"Yes, I am. I certainly am."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,,"Other inmates are also there. The current entertainment is the Andorian and Tellarite playing 'wheelbarrow'. When they've finished, Marta goes over to Kirk and starts fondling him.",
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,Keep your hands off Kirk! You treacherous thing!
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Marta,,You're jealous!
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"I am above that sort of thing. The Captain is annoyed by your attentions, that's all."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Marta,,"Am I annoying you, dearest?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,Not really.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Marta,,He finds me fascinating and you're bothered by it. Admit it.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,I may have you beaten to death.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Marta,,"No, you won't, because I am the most beautiful woman on this planet."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"You're the only woman on this planet, you stupid cow."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Marta,,"Well, I'm the most beautiful woman in this galaxy!"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,You're repulsive!
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Marta,,"I'm beautiful! And I'm intelligent too. I write poetry, and I paint marvellous pictures. And I am a wonderful dancer."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,Lies! All lies! You are the greatest liar I have ever met! Let me hear one poem you've written.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Marta,,If you like.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Spock,muttering,"If you could create a diversion, I might be able to find the control room and open the force field."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,"All we need is a few seconds, if Scotty has alerted the security detail."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"Gentlemen, courtesy for the performer."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Marta,,"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate. Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, and summer's lease hath all too soon"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,You wrote that?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Marta,,"Yesterday, as a matter of fact."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,It was written by an Earth man named Shakespeare a long time ago!
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Marta,,"Which does not alter the fact that I wrote it again yesterday! I think it's one of my best poems, don't you?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"I may kill you with my bare hands! (Marta runs to the other men) Actually, Captain, she is a superb dancer. Marta, my dear, won't you dance for our guests? That was not a request."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,,"Marta starts one of those sinuous Orion dances, although not as good as Vina.",
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"Marvellous, isn't she, Captain?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,"Yes, er, incredible."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"What is your reaction, Mister Spock?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Spock,,"I find it mildly interesting and somewhat nostalgic, if I understand the use of that word."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,Nostalgic?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Spock,,"Yes. It is somewhat reminiscent of the dances that Vulcan children do in nursery school. Of course, the children are not so well co-ordinated."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,,Marta's dance brings her up close and personal with both Garth and Kirk.,
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"She's yours if you wish, Captain."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,"Oh, er, thank you. That's, er, very magnanimous of you."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"You'll find that I am magnanimous to my friends and merciless to my enemies, and I want you, both of you, to be my friends."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Spock,,"On what, precisely, is our friendship to be based?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"Upon the firmest of foundations, Mister Spock. Enlightened self interest. You, Captain, are second only to me as the finest military commander in the galaxy."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,"That's very flattering. I am primarily an explorer now, Captain Garth."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,And so have I been. I have charted more new worlds than any man in history.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,And tried to destroy Antos Four.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Spock,,Why?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"Well, I could say because they were actively hostile to the Federation."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,"Yes, you could say, but that would be untrue."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"Agreed. Actually they were quite harmless, and they made me whole when I was maimed and dying. And in my gratitude, I offered them the galaxy. They rejected me, and I condemned them to death."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Spock,,"How could you, a Starship fleet Captain, believe that a Federation crew would blindly obey your order to destroy the entire Antos race, a people famous for their benevolence and peaceful pursuits?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"That was my only miscalculation. I had changed. I had risen above this decadent weakness which still has you in its command, by the way, Captain. My crew had not. I couldn't sway them, but my new crew, the men in this room, will obey my orders without question. Gentlemen, you have eyes but you cannot see. Galaxies surround us, limitless vistas. And yet the Federation would have us grub away like some ants on some somewhat larger than usual anthill. But I am not an insect. I am master of the universe, and I must claim my domain."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,"I agree there was a time when war was necessary, and you were our greatest warrior. I studied your victory at Axanar when I was a cadet. In fact it's still required reading at the Academy."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,As well it should be.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,Very well. But my first visit to Axanar was as a new fledged cadet on a peace mission.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,Peace mission! Politicians and weaklings!
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,"They were humanitarians and statesmen, and they had a dream. A dream that became a reality and spread throughout the stars, a dream that made Mister Spock and me brothers."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"Mister Spock, do you consider Captain Kirk and yourself brothers?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Spock,,"Captain Kirk speaks somewhat figuratively and with undue emotion. However, what he says is logical and I do, in fact, agree with it."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"Blind! Truly blind! Captain Kirk is your commanding officer and you are his subordinate. That is all. Yet, Mister Spock, you are a worthy commander in your own right, and in my fleet, you will surely have a Starship to command."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Spock,,"Please forgive me, but exactly where is your fleet?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"Out there waiting for me. They will flock to my cause, and for good reason. Limitless power, limitless wealth, and solar systems ruled by the elite. We, gentlemen, are that elite, and we must take what is rightfully ours from the decadent weaklings that now hold it."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Spock,,Captain Garth
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,Lord Garth!
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Spock,,"As you wish. At any rate, you must be aware of the fact that you are attempting to recreate the disaster which resulted in your becoming an inmate in this place."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,I was betrayed and treated barbarically.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Spock,,"On the contrary. You were treated with justice, and with compassion which you failed to show towards any of your intended victims. Logically, therefore, one must assume"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,Remove this animal!
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,,"Spock is hauled away, and Garth draws his phaser as Kirk stands. Then he becomes friendly again.",
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"Try some of this wine, Captain. It has a robust, full bodied flavour which you'll find diverting."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,No thank you. I prefer to join Mister Spock.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"And I prefer that you remain here. Marta, my dear. We found your little divertissement enchanting, didn't we, Captain? But there's more to come. The entertainment has merely begun. By the way, I assume you play chess."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,Occasionally.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,So do I. How would you respond to queen to queen's level three?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,I'm sure you're aware that there are an infinite number of countermoves.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,I'm interested in only one.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,I can't for the life of me imagine which one.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,For the life of me is a phrase well chosen. It could literally come to that.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,Dead I am of no use to you.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"But I can make you long for death, beg for death."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Marta,,"In the midnight of November, when the dead man's fare is nigh, and the danger in the valley, and the anger in the sky. I wrote that this morning. Do you like it?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,"Yes, I think it's very good."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Marta,,Tell him what he wants to know and we'll go away together.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,I can't.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Marta,,But you must. I beg of you.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"Oh, don't beg, Marta! It's degrading. Queen to queen's level three, Captain. You'll talk freely and quite soon."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,,A chunky chair is wheeled into the room.,
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Narrator,,"What you see before you, Captain, is my latest invention. Quite ordinary in appearance, almost primitive, wouldn't you say?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,"Yes, I recognise it. It's used for rehabilitation purposes."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Cory,,It helped many men back to health.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"Appearances can be deceiving. Once it was a part of the rehabilitation process, and as such, quite painless. And I might add useless too. It made men docile and of no use to me. I've added certain refinements to the use of ultrasonic waves. The chair is no longer painless. Put the governor in it. Queen to queen's level three, Captain Kirk? It is, in fact, exquisitely painful, as you will now see."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,,"The lights either side of Cory's head, swirl, and he begins to pant and groan.",
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"Interesting, isn't it? The pain is real and can be prolonged indefinitely, because there is no actual destruction of tissue."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,Stop it!
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,,Garth turns it off.,
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"Of course, Captain. You have but to ask. Now, as you can see, he has not been harmed physically, yet the memory of the exquisite torment remains. Queen to queen's level three, Captain."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,No.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,Too bad. Remove our distinguished governor. Put Captain Kirk in the chair.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,,"Kirk tries to make a break for it, but fails.",
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Marta,,"No, you mustn't do that!"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"You really are becoming offensive to me, my dear. Don't make it necessary for me to put you in it. Queen to queen's level three, Captain Kirk."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Marta,,"Please, stop it!"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"You want him, don't you?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Marta,,Yes.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,Badly enough to join him?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Marta,,"Listen to me, my Lord Garth. I can get him to tell me what you want to know."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,It might be interesting to have you try.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Scott,,No breakthrough?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Uhura,,"No, Mister Scott. Still no response from the planet."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Scott,,Sensor readings?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Sulu,,The force field is weakest on the far side of the planet. We can send down a shuttlecraft carrying a team in environmental suits.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Mccoy,,"It won't work, Scotty. They'd have to cover thousands of miles through poisonous atmosphere before they'd ever reach the asylum."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, you're right. Even if they made it, they couldn't carry anything powerful enough to break through the asylum dome. Only the ship herself could do that."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Mccoy,,Probably kill Jim and Spock.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Scot,,"Doctor, they may already be dead."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Narrator,,"In an orange room, Marta gently gives the waking Kirk a drink of water.)"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Marta,,"Slowly, darling, slowly. Rest."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Kirk,,"Is this more of Garth's persuasion, Marta?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Marta,,I told him I'd discover your secret. I lied. I would have told him anything to save you from that torment.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Kirk,,I believe you mean that.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Marta,,I do. (kisses him) This is where I've longed to be. I think I knew I loved you from the moment I first saw you.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Kirk,,"Marta. Marta, I can help you, but I must get to the Enterprise to do that."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Marta,,That's not possible.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Kirk,,"Yes, it is. It is if I can get to the control room and remove the force field, then Garth is finished."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Marta,,Garth is my leader.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Kirk,,He will lead you to destruction. He's already destroyed the medicine that could have helped you. But there's more medicine aboard the ship.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Marta,,"I'll help you, but you must wait. You do see that, don't you? Soon your friend Spock will be here and then"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Kirk,,Spock?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Marta,,At least I've arranged that much.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Kirk,,How did you manage that?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Marta,,A convincing lie told to a guard who finds me desirable. Darling.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,,"She kisses him again, then reaches under the pillow for a dagger. Kirk disarms her, she crawls after the blade and Spock arrives.",
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Marta,,"No, you mustn't stop me. He's my lover and I have to kill him."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,,Spock neck-pinches her.,
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Spock,,She seems to have worked out an infallible method for assuring permanent male fidelity. Interesting.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Kirk,,I'm very glad to see you.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Spock,,"Thank you, Captain. (draws a phaser) We're now armed. I presume we shall try to reach the control room."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,Kirk,,"Yes, you presume correctly."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,room,,"They head along the corridor, until they see a Tellarite standing guard. Spock stuns him. Kirk takes his weapon and they head into the control room.",
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Spock,,"Force field is now off, Captain."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Uhura,,"Mister Scott, it's the captain."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Scott,,"Scott here, Captain."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Scott,,You had us worried.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,"Mister Scott, I want a fully armed security detail beamed down here on the double."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Scott,,"They're already in the transporter room, sir."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,And have Doctor McCoy prepare additional medicine as quickly as possible.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Scott,,"Aye, aye, sir."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Spock,,"Captain, I suggest you return to the ship at once. Your safety is vital to the Enterprise."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Scott,,"Waiting for your order, Captain."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Spock,,I also request permission to remain here in charge of the security team when they beam down.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,"Very well, Spock."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Scott,,"Still waiting, Captain."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Spock,,"Mister Scott, the Captain's life is in immediate danger. Beam him aboard at once. The security team will be entrusted to me."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Scott,,Queen to queen's level three. Repeat. Queen to queen's level three.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Spock,,"He's waiting for the proper reply, Captain."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Scott,,Give the countersign as ordered.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,"Scotty, Mister Spock will give the countersign."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Spock,,"Give him the countersign, Captain."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Scott,,"Security detail, standby to beam down."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,,Spock reactivates the forcefield and turns into Garth.,
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Garth,,"Blast away, Captain, if you can. Do you think I'm fool enough to give you a charged phaser?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,What have you done with Spock? Where is he?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Garth,,"I have done nothing with him as of yet, but I do have plans for him. The Vulcan will die rather horribly, and his death will be on your conscience."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,Captain Garth
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Garth,,Lord Garth!
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,"No, sir. Captain Garth, Starship fleet Captain. That's an honourable title."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Garth,,"And I was the greatest of them all, wasn't I?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,"Yes, you were. Yes. But you're a sick man now, sir."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Garth,,I have never been more healthy.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,"No. No, think. Think back to what you were before the accident that sent you to Antos Four. Try."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Garth,,I can't remember. It's almost as if I had died and was reborn.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,"No, I, I can remember. You were the finest student at the Academy, the finest Starship Captain. You were the prototype, the model for the rest of us."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Garth,,"Yes, I do remember that. It was a great responsibility, but one I was proud to bear."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,"And you bore it well. And the disease that changed you, it's not your fault. And the terrible things you did since then, not truly responsible."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Garth,,"I don't want to hear any more. You're weak, you're trying to drain my strength."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,"No, I'm not. I want you to find what you once had. I want you to go back to the greatness that you've lost, Captain Garth."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Garth,,I am Lord Garth! Master of the universe! You doubt me only because I have not as yet had my coronation.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,"No, sir, listen to me. I"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Garth,,Stop! On your knees.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,No.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Garth,,"On your knees before me! All the others before me have failed. Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, Lee Kuan, Krotus! All of them are dust! But I will triumph! I will make the ultimate conquest!"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,,Kirk reaches for the forcefield control and gets stunned for his efforts.,
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,,The tables are being rearranged.,
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"The throne must be higher. It must be higher than anything else in this room. Use that table as a pedestal. Ah, welcome back, Captain Kirk. I'm glad you could make it for the coronation."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,Coronation?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"Yes. Oh, I know that even a real throne is no more than merely a chair, but the symbolism is important, don't you agree?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,"Yes, I agree. You'll wear a crown too, I presume?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"But again, just as a token. Not impressive in itself, but it will serve as a standard around which our followers will rally."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,"Garth, you have only a handful of men."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"You do refuse to enter into the spirit of the thing, don't you, Captain? Perhaps you'd like a larger role in the ceremony. You could serve as human sacrifice, for example."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Kirk,,"No, I wouldn't enjoy that at all. Besides, you seem to need me alive."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"How true. All right, how about crown prince? That would make you our heir apparent. Heir apparent, I believe, is the proper role for you. Besides, we have other candidates for our human sacrifice. Who knows? Ready."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,,"Garth goes out and comes in again with Marta on his arm. She carries a crown on a pillow. They walk between two lines of inmates, who kneel",
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,"Well, since there is no one mighty enough to perform this ceremony, we'll perform it ourselves. Therefore, we hereby proclaim that I am Lord Garth, master of the universe. And we designate our beloved Marta to be our consort. And we further designate Captain James Kirk of the Starship Enterprise to be our heir apparent."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,,"Garth walks up and down, then climbs up onto the table and sits on the chair.",
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,Garth,,Now remove our heir apparent that we may conclude this ceremony.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,dining room,,Kirk is led out into the corridor by the Andorian and the Tellarite.,
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,"Listen to me. This may be our last chance. Garth will destroy all of us unless you help me stop him. And he's using you, you know that, because he wants the power for himself. I brought something that might have cured you, but he destroyed it. If I can get a patrol down, they'd bring more of that medicine and"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,,Kirk tries to switch off the forcefield and gets hits for his effort. Garth enters.,
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Garth,,"Well done. Well, Captain, you continue to resist. How stupid of you. Put him in that chair right here. I've arranged a small entertainment. I wouldn't want him to miss any of it. Well, Captain, even you must admit that I'm a genius. What you see here is my latest invention. This is an explosive, the most powerful one in history. If I were to drop this flask, the resulting explosion would vaporise this planet. Now do you see why it is ridiculous to resist me? Well, perhaps you require the demonstration I've arranged.

71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Mccoy,,"I know it, Scotty."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Scott,,"Well, there's one last thing we might try. Perhaps the ship's phasers can cut through a section of the force field at its weakest point. Where did you say that was located, Mister Sulu?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,bridge,Sulu,,"On the far side of the planet, Mister Scott."

71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk,,"All I can say, Garth, if it happens to me, it happens to you."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Garth,,"You're an extraordinary fellow, Kirk. Your stubbornness defies all logic. Logic, that is the key. Your friend Spock is a logical man. A very logical man. Go and bring the Vulcan here to me."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,,"Spock is in a detention cell, calmly testing the forcefield in the doorway. When the Andorian and Tellarite arrive, he is lying on the floor. They have to pick him up and carry him between them. Once in the corridor, he neck-pinches the pair of them, takes a phaser and heads off on his own.",
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Garth,,"Spock is not only a more logical man than you, Captain, but a more intelligent one, I'm sure. I shall establish a rapport with him."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,,An alarm alerts him to the approach of the Vulcan.,
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Garth,,Fascinating. Your Vulcan friend is a very ingenious fellow. This could be most amusing.

71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk 1,,Yes. They may walk into a trap.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk 2,,That's right. Garth can destroy us.
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Spock,,Fascinating. What maneuver did we use to defeat the Romulan vessel near Tau Ceti?
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk 1,,"Very good, Spock. The Cochrane deceleration."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Kirk 2,,"Spock, you know the Cochrane deceleration's a classic battle maneuver. Every Starship Captain knows that."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,Spock,,"Agreed, Captain. Captains. Gentlemen, whichever one of you is Captain Garth must at this moment be expending a great deal of energy to maintain the image of Captain Kirk. That energy level cannot be maintained indefinitely, and I have time."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,control room,,"Spock pulls a chair towards him to sit down, and Kirk 2 attacks him. Then the two Kirk's wrestle each other. Finally one is holding the chair over the other's head, ready to smash it down on his helpless victim.",

71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,treatment room,Spock,,"It was not impossible, Captain. Our presence here is proof of that."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,treatment room,Kirk,,"Yes, and congratulations. What took you so long?"
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,treatment room,Spock,,"The interval of uncertainty was actually fairly brief, Captain. It only seemed long to you. I was waiting for a victor in the hand to hand struggle, which I assumed would be Captain Garth. Because of your depleted condition. Failing a resolution to the struggle, I was forced to use other means to make my determination."
71,3,Whom Gods Destroy,treatment room,Kirk,,"I see. Mister Spock. Letting yourself be hit on the head, and I presume you let yourself be hit on the head, is not exactly a method King Solomon would have approved. Mister Scott, ready to beam up."

The treaty negotiations have been difficult because Gideon has consistently refused the presence of a delegation from the Federation on its soil, or any surveillance by the ship's sensors. They have finally agreed to a delegation of one. They insisted it be the Captain of the Enterprise. I am, therefore, beaming down at once."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,transporter room,Narrator,,"KIRK; It's too bad Gideon isn't cleared for general visitation, Mister Spock. According to the physio-cultural reports submitted to the Federation, it's a virtual paradise."

72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Chekov,,Co-ordinates confirmed.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Hodin,,We gave you the exact co-ordinates which should have brought Captain Kirk directly to this very room.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"I am not questioning that, sir."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,"If he is not here, that is your own responsibility, Mister Spock, and that of your staff."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"I do not deny that, sir. I am not attempting to blame your personnel."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Hodin,,We are glad to hear that. We shall enter it into the records of this most unfortunate event.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Your Excellency, even with intricate machinery as delicately balanced as ours, there is still a margin for error which must be dealt with."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Spock,,It is possible that Captain Kirk materialised on some other part of Gideon.

72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,,McCoy enters,
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,Your Excellency. May I cut right to the heart of the matter? I request permission to beam down to conduct a search for our captain.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,Permission denied.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Hodin,,Your Federation must be aware
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,Of our jealous tradition of isolation from all contaminating contacts
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Hodin,,With the violent nature of planets of other star systems.

72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Hodin,,"Of course, we shall institute a thorough search. In the meantime, Mister Spock, I suggest that you look to your machinery."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,,Transmission ends,
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,We must acknowledge once and for all that the purpose of diplomacy is to prolong a crisis.

72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"We are representatives of the Federation, Doctor."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Mccoy,,That doesn't mean we have behave like children and listen to some fool lecture by a diplomat!
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Unfortunately, diplomacy is the only channel available to us at the moment. The planet is shielded from our sensors, therefore we cannot scan it. Therefore we are unable to select co-ordinates. They must be provided by Gideon."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Chekov,,We should never have agreed to such restrictions.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"We did not, Mister Chekov. The Federation did. Lieutenant Uhura."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, Mister Spock."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,Contact Starfleet immediately. Explain our problem. Request permission to use every means at our disposal to press the search for Captain Kirk.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Uhura,,"At once, sir."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Chekov,,Are there any other possibilities?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"There are endless, Mister Chekov."

72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Institute a sensor scan three hundred and sixty degrees, one degree at a time."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Mccoy,,You mean you're going to scan space for him?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Sulu,,"But, sir, that could take years."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Then the sooner you begin, the better."

72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Odona,,I don't know.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,You? What happened before you came here? Try to remember. It's important.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Odona,,"It seems I was standing in a, yes. I was standing in a large auditorium crowded with people. Thousands pressed in against me. I could hardly breathe. I was fighting for oxygen, screaming to get out."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,Don't be afraid.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Odona,,"I'm not, but you are troubled."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,"I seem to be the only one of my crew left on board the Enterprise. Four hundred and thirty, and I, apparently, am the only one left."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Odona,,I'm sorry. I wish I could help.

72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Odona,,I don't know. Not long. Is it important?

72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,Did you advise them the captain's life is at stake?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir. They insist that the matter must be referred to the Federation."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,What department?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Uhura,,Bureau of Planetary Treaties.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,Contact them directly.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Uhura,,"I did, Mister Spock. They insist that we must go through Starfleet channels."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Sulu,,"With the captain lost, sir, that's the best they could come up with?"

72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,"I don't know. I'm not familiar with that quadrant. Odona, you must realise that we're not here by accident. Some force, some intelligence has arranged this for a purpose."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,"Captain, before I said I wasn't afraid. Now I am."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Uhura,,"The ambassador will speak, sir. They're requesting visual communication."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,"Good news. Very good news indeed, Mister Spock. Your captain is definitely not on Gideon. As you requested, we made a most thorough search, and you will be relieved to know that you may now investigate all the other possibilities and forget about Gideon."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Spock,,But that is not what we requested.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,You requested a most thorough search. It is in the record. And we have used every means at our disposal to accommodate you.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Spock,,"Your record on the subject is not precise, Your Excellency."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,"Surely, Mister Spock, you do not intend, I hope, to create a dispute between the Federation and Gideon?"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Spock,,"Your Excellency, a dispute is the farthest thing from our minds, and there's no need to check your records. I merely suggest that the language of our statement may not have been understood exactly as intended."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,"Mister Spock, you're an officer of a spaceship. In your profession, you use many instruments, tools and weapons to achieve your objectives."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"True, Your Excellency."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Hodin,,"However, the only tool diplomacy has is language."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,It is of the utmost importance that the meaning be crystal clear.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Your Excellency, I am basically a scientist. Clarity of formulation is essential in my profession also."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,I'm glad to hear it. Perhaps you could then make greater effort to choose your words more precisely.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Mccoy,,Are you going to let him get away with that?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Scott,,"No matter what you say, Mister Spock, he'll twist your meaning."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, he's infuriating, sir. How can you stand it?"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Mccoy,,We do not leave without being absolutely sure ourselves that everything has been done.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Mccoy,,Now certainly you understand our feelings about that.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,Mister Spock! Mister Spock!
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Yes, Your Excellency."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,Are you still there?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Yes, Your Excellency."

72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Hodin,,"What was said. Would you repeat, please?"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"I apologise for the noise, your Excellency. To summarise, I request permission to transport down to Gideon."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,"Forgive me, Mister Spock. No criticism of your equipment was intended. But it has sent your captain on some strange journey, a safe one we all still hope."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Hodin,,"But it could create for us serious incidents with your Federation, and now you propose to"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,Repeat this disaster with another officer? This would be madness.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Scott,,"I'll not take that, Mister Spock. That transporter was in perfect condition. I guarantee that myself. Transport me down right this minute, and I'll prove to those gentlemen."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Mister Scott, you'll go to the transporter room and await my orders."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, Mister Spock."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,,"Scott leaves, muttering",
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Hodin,,"I could not quite make that out, Mister Spock."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,Would you be so good as to repeat what you said?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Yes, Your Excellency. The ship's engineer was explaining that the malfunction, which did exist, has now been repaired. We would appreciate an opportunity to test the equipment. I, therefore, request permission"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Spock,,To beam down to your council chamber.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,"But, Mister Spock, you"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Your Excellency, grant this one request."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,"You are a very persistent fellow, Mister Spock. Very well, then, You shall test the skill of your very excitable"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Hodin,,Repairman.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,There is one proviso. We cannot risk further incidents. You will therefore transport a member of my staff to your ship. Let us first see if that works.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Thank you, Your Excellency. Your proposal is accepted. Mister Scott."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Scott,,Scott here.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,Prepare to beam aboard a representative of the Gideon council.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, aye, sir."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,"My assistant will provide you with the proper, what is the word?"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Spock,,Co-ordinates.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,"Thank you. Proceed, Krodak."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Krodak,standing,Eight seven five.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Scott,,Eight seven five.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Krodak,,Zero two zero.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Scott,,Zero two zero.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,transporter room,Krodak,,Seven zero nine.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,transporter room,Scott,,Seven zero nine. Energising.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,transporter room,,Krodak disappears from the bridge viewscreen and appears in the transporter room,
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,transporter room,Scott,,"Mister Spock, the gentleman from Gideon is here."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Your Excellency, your assistant has arrived safely, and I am now ready to transport down to Gideon."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Hodin,,"Now, now, not so fast, Mister Spock. That is quite a different matter. We agreed to allow one representative on our soil, your captain."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Sir, our captain is still missing, and I now demand that I be allowed to transport to Gideon as we agreed."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Hodin,,"Forgive me, Mister Spock, but I overstepped my authority when I made that agreement. However, your request will be taken up at the next full session of Gideon's council."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,,Transmission ends,
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Mister Scott, beam down the gentleman from Gideon."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Narrator,,"SCOTT; Yes, Mister Spock. I'm sending him straight to the same co-ordinates."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Mccoy,,"Just when I was beginning to think you might find a whole new career as a diplomat, Mister Spock."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Do not give up hope. Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet Command. Demand an immediate reply to our request for permission to beam down to Gideon."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, Mister Spock. Enterprise to Starfleet Command. Enterprise to Starfleet Command."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,Enterprise to Starfleet Command. Enterprise to Starfleet Command. Captain Kirk here. Red priority. Red priority.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,Isn't it in working order?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,It seems to be.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,Then someone should have heard you.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,"Captain Kirk here. Please answer red priority. Please answer red priority. Well, if someone is listening, they're not answering."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,Why should they do that?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,They wouldn't.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,,Kirk goes to the engineering station and swaps a couple of tapes over.,
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,What did you do?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,Took the ship out of warp speed.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,Out of what?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,Space terminology. We're no longer moving faster than the speed of light. I've trimmed down to sublight speed until we find out where we are.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,It feels the same.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,Of course it does. Maybe it is the same.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,"Well, has the ship slowed down?"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,referring to viewscreen,"If you believe that, we have."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,"Oh, please! Don't tell me the sky is out of order now. It's so quiet. So peaceful."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,"It isn't really, you know."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,And it's beautiful.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,"Yes. Yes, it is. Very, very beautiful."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,"And we're alone. Can you make it last a long, long time?"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,How long would you like it to last?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,Forever.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,"Well, let's see. Power, that's no problem, it regenerates. And food. We have enough to feed a crew of four hundred and thirty for five years. So that should last us"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,Forever. All my life I've dreamed of being alone.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,Most people are afraid of being alone.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,"Where I come from, people dream of it."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,Why? Why are the people of Gideon like that?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,"Gideon? I told you, I don't know where I come from, what my planet is."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,It might be Gideon.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,Does it matter so much?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,Yes. It might help me pinpoint our location.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,"And then you might find your crew. Being here with you, I forgot there must be others. I envy you your sense of loyalty. I want to ease your feeling of dread, your fear that all your crew no longer exists."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,"I've got to contact whoever is manipulating us. There must be a way. Odona. Odona, can you remember why your people dream of being alone?"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,Because they never can be.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,Why? What makes it so impossible to be alone?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,"Because there are so many of us. So many. There is no place, no street, no house, no garden, no beach, no mountain that is not filled with people. Each one of us would kill in order to find a place alone to himself. They would willingly die for it, if they could."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,Who sent you here?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,No one commands Odona. I was not sent here.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Kirk,,"You've come to kill. Odona, have you come to die?"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Odona,,I don't know. I don't care. I only know I'm here. I only know I'm happy.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,,"They kiss, and dozens of faces appear on the viewscreen. They watch as Kirk leads Odona away.",
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,"Now, all I have to do is find a medical kit, and I can completely cure this. (his arm)"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Odona,,Cure?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,"Yes, the irritation would be gone."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Odona,,What will happen if you do not find one? Will you become sick and die?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,"No. Over something as simple as this? No, it'll cure itself eventually, but. Do you know, uh I don't even remember how this happened. Do you hear that?"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Odona,,"Yes, it sounds like an engine."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,"No, the ship's engines don't make that kind of sound."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Odona,,But there is something wrong with the equipment. Could that be it?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,I know every sound that this ship might make. That's coming from outside.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Odona,,A storm might
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,"A storm might, but you wouldn't be able to hear it. Come on."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Kirk,,"This is a viewing port. We'll be able to see outside. If there's a storm, we'll be able to see it."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,,"Kirk presses a button, but the steel shutter does not raise",
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Kirk,,If it works.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,,"uses a manual override, and the shutters slide open to reveal faces which are then replaced by a starfield.",
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Odona,,People. The faces of people. And then the stars. What's happening? What's out there? The sound is gone.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Kirk,,"It was like the heartbeat of all those people, and thousands upon thousands more pressing against the ship."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Odona,,But you said we were moving through space.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Kirk,,"Yes, I said that."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Odona,,Then the people can't be out there.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Kirk,,"Yes, they can."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Odona,,Please don't frighten me.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Kirk,,It could be a mirage. They could exist in our minds.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Odona,,You mean that we're going mad.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Kirk,,Or some power is creating the illusion in our minds that we are somewhere near your planet. But why?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Odona,,I don't know. I don't know.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Kirk,,"I think I have an idea. So that we won't keep trying to find out where we are, that we'll be content to stay here."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Odona,,"Oh, be content!"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Kirk,,Be content? Be content? Not until I find out what happened to my crew. Are they dead?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Odona,,I don't know.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Kirk,,Did you kill them so you could have the ship to yourself?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,observation deck,Odona,,Captain.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Odona,,"Captain, something's happening to me. I never felt like this before."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Kirk,,I've never felt like this before either.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Odona,,Is this the way one looks when one is developing a sickness?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Kirk,,"There's no sickness on your planet, remember?"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Odona,,Now there will be. There will be sickness. There will be death.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,,"She passes out in his arms. The council members file out. Outside the window, a mass of people struggle to move towards their destination.",
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,Hodin.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Hodin,,"Yes, Captain Kirk. Our experiment has passed the first stage."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,Let me in there. I can help her.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Hodin,,We have no need of any of your medicines.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,But she's ill.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Hodin,,"And we're grateful to you for her illness. You have done well, my daughter."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,,Kirk hands Odona over to Hodin,
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Hodin,,Guard the captain well. We shall need him for a long time.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Admiral,,"I sympathize deeply, but Starfleet cannot override Federation directives in this matter."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Admiral, the crew will not understand it."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Admiral,,Has your crew suddenly become interested in provoking a war? That is not Starfleet's mission.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,We wish only to save the life of the captain.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Admiral,,"You have not proved your case to the Federation, or to Starfleet, for that matter."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"I am positive that I can do so to your satisfaction, Admiral. I have been convinced, since my first exchange with the ambassador, that the captain has been taken prisoner."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Admiral,,"Granted as fact, Mister Spock."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"I now know where the captain is being held, if he is being held at the same place to which we transported him."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Admiral,,They would not dare harm him in the Gideon council chamber.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Sir, the captain is not being held in the Gideon council chamber. He is being held nearby."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Admiral,,You have answered what and where. I'm waiting for your explanation of why.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Since the planet is shielded from our sensors, we cannot establish that without on the spot investigation."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Admiral,,Do you have evidence the captain's life is threatened? Permission denied.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Admiral, I wish to state for the record that your decision is completely arbitrary."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Admiral,,So noted.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Odona,,Will it last long?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Hodin,,That depends on the strength of the one infected. You have great strength.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Odona,,How will you know when I am to die?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Hodin,,"Your body temperature will be very great. You will see us, but you will not know who we are."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Odona,,"I must see him before then, Father."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Hodin,,Rest. Now lie still. Do you feel great pain?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Odona,,"Yes, in my arms and thighs."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Hodin,,What is it like to feel pain?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Odona,,"It is like, like when you see the people have no hope for happiness, Father. You feel great despair, and your heart is heavy because you know you can do nothing. Pain is like that."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Hodin,,Your courage gives me great pride.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,Let me see her.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Hodin,,Not yet.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,You don't know what she may have.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Hodin,,But we do. She has Vegan choriomeningitis.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,"It's very rare, and always fatal if not treated within twenty four hours. I know, it almost killed me."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Hodin,,Yes. Our prime minister learned about you during our negotiations. That's why we brought you here. Your blood provided the micro-organisms which infected her.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,That's how my arm got hurt.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Hodin,,"Yes. As Odona told you, we have no need for medical practitioners here. Our apologies. We were unforgivably awkward to have hurt you."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,,"Kirk has a fight with his two guards, and loses.",
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,You're mad.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Hodin,,No. We are desperate.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Mccoy,,I don't understand how Starfleet can deny permission to beam down to search for the captain.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"They did not ask for our understanding, Doctor."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Scott,,I don't see how they expect us to sit here and wait for the captain to reappear.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Unfortunately, I must violate a direct order from Starfleet."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Mccoy,,"That's the best possible decision you could make, Spock. I'm with you."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"I do not make it lightly, Doctor. However, Command knows that Ambassador Hodin has not been totally honest with us. Lieutenant Uhura, repeat original Gideon co-ordinates for beam down."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Uhura,,"Eight seven five, zero two zero, zero seven nine."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Mister Scott, the co-ordinates given you?"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Scott,,"Eight seven five, zero two zero, seven zero nine."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Mccoy,,Co-ordinates don't match.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Precisely. I shall beam down at once. Mister Scott, you have the conn."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Mccoy,,I'll pick up my medical tricorder and meet you in the transporter room.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"Negative, Doctor. I cannot accept the responsibility for ordering a fellow officer to violate a Starfleet directive. I can make such a decision only for myself."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Mccoy,,I'm not asking you to make the decision for me.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"The situation forces me to do so, Doctor."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Mccoy,,"In that case, it's the worst possible decision you can make, Spock."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,This will not take long.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,,Spock leaves,
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Scott,,Isn't that just about what Captain Kirk said before he left?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,fake transporter room,Spock,into intercom,Captain Kirk. Spock here. Captain Kirk?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,fake transporter room,,"He goes out into the corridor, scanning with his tricorder.",
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Kirk,,"Your report to the Federation was a tissue of lies. You described environmental, physical, cultural conditions that would make Gideon a paradise."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,"And so it was! A long, long time ago what we described was true! The atmosphere on Gideon has always been germ-free. And the people flourished in their physical and spiritual perfection. Eventually, even the life span increased. Death became almost unknown to us. It occurred only when the body could no longer regenerate itself, and that happens now only to the very old."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Kirk,,Those are conditions most people would envy.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,"But Gideon did not find it enviable. The birth rate continued to rise, and the population grew, until now Gideon is encased in a living mass who can find no rest, no peace, no joy."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Kirk,,Then why haven't you introduced any of the new techniques to sterilise men and women?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,Every organ renews itself. It would be impossible.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Kirk,,Then let your people learn about the devices to safely prevent conception. The Federation will provide anything you need.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,"But you see, the people of Gideon have always believed that life is sacred. That the love of life is the greatest gift. That is the one unshakable truth of Gideon. And this overwhelming love of life has developed our regenerative capacity and our great longevity."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Kirk,,And the great misery which you now face.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,"That is bitterly true, Captain. Nevertheless, we cannot deny the truth which shaped our evolution. We are incapable of destroying or interfering with the creation of that which we love so deeply. Life, in every form, from foetus to developed being. It is against our tradition, against our very nature. We simply could not do it."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Kirk,,Yet you can kill a young girl.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,We're trying to re-adjust the life cycle of an entire civilisation.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Kirk,,You're killing your own daughter. How can you do that?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,"My daughter hoped to make you feel the agony of Gideon. But it was impossible. No stranger could realize the horror that life can be here. I will not beg for your understanding of my personal grief, nor will I parade it for you to gain your co-operation. My love for my daughter is too deep for display. My pride in her runs even deeper. My daughter freely chose to do what she is doing, as the people of Gideon are free to choose."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Kirk,,The virus you need is very rare. Who will provide it?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,You will stay. Your blood will provide it.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Kirk,,"No sir, not me. You have many methods available. I've mentioned only a few. I do not offer my life for this purpose. I have many plans, and I have hopes other than death for Odona."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,My daughter pleaded with you to stay.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Kirk,,What was said and what happened between us was for us alone.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,She hoped you would love her and wish to stay.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Kirk,,So that was your plan. That I would fall so under her spell that I would give up my freedom and become a willing sacrifice.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,Stay with us. We're desperate.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Krodak,,Odona's fever is rising. She's calling the name of James Kirk.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,council chamber,Hodin,,"You see, you cannot leave us now. Go to her."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Spock,,An exact duplicate of the Enterprise. But completely inoperative. (into communicator) Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Scott,,"Scott here, Mister Spock."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Spock,,I am speaking to you from the bridge of the Enterprise.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Scott,,You're where?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Spock,,"On the bridge of the Enterprise, Mister Scott."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Scott,,Those were the co-ordinates you insisted on.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Spock,,And they were correct. I'm on board an exact duplicate of the Enterprise.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Mccoy,,"An exact duplicate of the Enterprise? Is it in orbit, Mister Spock?"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Spock,,"In orbit, Doctor. In a manner of speaking, Gideon is in orbit and the ship is on Gideon."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, that's a beginning, but what about the captain?"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Spock,,I'm sure he's on board somewhere. I'm picking up life readings. Spock out.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,empty bridge,Narrator,,"Ship's log, stardate 5423.8. First Officer Spock reporting. Obviously the Gideon's have transported Captain Kirk onto this replica of the Enterprise to so confuse his mind as to make him susceptible to some extraordinary experiment. It is my intention to locate the captain and warn him before the experiment reaches its conclusion, which logic indicates means the end of the captain's life as he knows it."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Kirk,,"If you don't allow me to bring Doctor McCoy down here, it'll soon be too late to do anything for her."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Hodin,,"We have told you, it is her wish and mine that there be no interference with the natural progress of the virus."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Kirk,,"Her death is unnecessary. Even if she lives, her blood will provide the same serum you need as mine would."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Hodin,,"No, her death at so young an age will let the people know for certain that our lifecycle can be changed. It's the symbol that'll bring forth the dedicated young volunteers. The serum in their new blood will change Gideon, and it will once more be the paradise it was."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Odona,,I'm glad that you are here. Is the time short?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Kirk,,Very short.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Odona,,And I asked you to make our journey last forever. Oh. It began here.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Kirk,,"And it can continue. If only you'll allow me, I can cure you."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,captain's quarters,Odona,,"I'm not afraid of what will happen, but it's just that now I wish with all my heart to stay with you forever."

72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well, that was close, but you made it."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,sickbay,Odona,,I am cured?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,sickbay,Mccoy,,Right. Just like the captain.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,sickbay,,McCoy leaves,
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,sickbay,Odona,,"Instead of smiling at me, you should be shouting in anger."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,sickbay,Kirk,,"Why, because you're well again?"
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,sickbay,Odona,,No. Because I pretended to be (pause) How can you bear to look at me after the way I deceived you?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,sickbay,Kirk,,At least you owe me the privilege of letting me look at you.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,sickbay,Odona,,"You are a gentleman, Captain Kirk."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,sickbay,Kirk,,"Thank you, ma'am."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,sickbay,Odona,,You are no longer needed on Gideon. I can take your place there.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,sickbay,Kirk,,Is that what you want to do?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,sickbay,Odona,,That is what I must do. I am needed there now.

72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Odona,,It is not like our ship.
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,"Oh, yes, it is. It's exactly the same. Only this one works."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Odona,,It goes to many other planets?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,"Yes, it goes to the whole galaxy. With another difference. This one is crowded."
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Odona,,It seems crowded to you?
72,3,The Mark Of Gideon,corridor,Kirk,,It does now.

It is a planetoid set up by the Federation solely as a central library containing the total cultural history and scientific knowledge of all planetary Federation members. With us is specialist Lieutenant Mira Romaine. She is on board to supervise the transfer of newly designed equipment directly from the Enterprise to Memory Alpha."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Scott,,"You're the sanest, the smartest, the nicest woman that has ever come aboard this ship."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Mira,,Anything else?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Scott,,"Anything else, I'll keep to myself for the moment."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Kirk,,"When a man of Scotty's years falls in love, the loneliness of his life is suddenly revealed to him. His whole heart once throbbed only to the ship's engines. He could talk only to the ship. Now he can see nothing but the woman."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Chekov,,I didn't think Mister Scott would go for the brainy type.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,I don't think he's even noticed she has a brain.

73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Scott,turning from Mira,Hmm?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"As soon as we're within viewing range of Memory Alpha, you and Lieutenant Romaine will go to the emergency manual monitor. You'll prepare for direct transfer of equipment."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, Captain."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Mira,,"We're ready, sir."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant, may I offer my congratulations on what will be your first assignment for the Federation?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes. Good luck, Lieutenant."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Mira,,Thank you.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, I'm picking up a high intensity reading."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Is that Memory Alpha?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"No, sir."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,,There's a bright thing in the middle of the viewscreen.) An engineer touches Scott's arm to attract his attention.,
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Scott,,Excuse me.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Magnification eight. What is that?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,"Indications are a storm, Captain, although I've never seen one of such great intensity or strange confirmation."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Readings?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,All sensor readings are at maximum calibration.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, it's approaching at warp factor two point six and accelerating."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Check that. No natural phenomena can move faster than the speed of light.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,"It is definitely doing so, Captain. Therefore it cannot be a phenomenon of nature."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Deflectors on. Condition yellow.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Uhura,,"Condition yellow, sir."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"Shields activated, Captain."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,,The bright thing 'invades' the ship with sparkles. Only Mira does not shield her eyes from it. Then the sparkles withdraw.,

73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,,Mira gently falls to the floor.,

73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Scott,,Mira! Mira! (her eyes and mouth are open) What's that you're saying'?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,,McCoy enters,
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Mccoy,,Was she hurt by the fall or the action of the disturbance?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"I don't know. Did you notice, Scotty?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Scott,,"Well, after the disturbance was over, she just collapsed. How's she doing, Doctor?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, I think she's coming around now."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Scott,,"Easy, now. Easy. You had quite a fall."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Mira,,"I'm, I'm fine."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Mccoy,,You let me be the judge of that. Do you feel like walking to Sickbay?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Mira,,"I'm fine, Doctor. Really, I am. Is everybody else all right?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Scott,,"Aye, they are. Now you just do what Doctor McCoy ordered."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Mira,,Why? I feel
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Get to Sickbay, Lieutenant. That's an order."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Mira,,"Yes, sir."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Scott,,"Captain, would it be all right if I went along to Sickbay?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"No, Mister Scott. Stay at your post for the moment."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Scott,,But Captain
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Lieutenant Uhura. Damage report.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Uhura,,"Yes, sir. All stations are operative, sir."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Mister Spock?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,Some equipment was temporarily out of order. My sensors were inoperative.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Any damage to the warp engines?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,"None, Captain."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Good. From the action of that storm, we'll need all the speed we can get."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, it was not a storm."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain. During the disturbance, Memory Alpha was hailing. I wanted to respond, but I couldn't make my hand move."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Chekov,,Captain. It was not hands that were paralysed. It was eyes. I could not force my eyes to look down and set a new course.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"No, it was speech that was affected. I couldn't utter a sound."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, explanation."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,"Only of the result, not of the cause. In each case, a different area of the brain was affected. Our voluntary nerve functions were under some form of pressure."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Or attack.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,"Attack might be a more precise formulation, Captain."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,And Lieutenant Romaine seems most susceptible.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Are the readings corresponding, Nurse?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Chapel,,"Everything appears normal, Doctor."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mccoy,,Thank you.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,,Scott enters,
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mira,,"What's that you're doing, Nurse?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Chapel,,Recording your responses in this computer.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mira,,But why? I haven't had a single response worth noting.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Chapel,,"Lieutenant, please."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mira,,"Well, have l?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Lieutenant, there are four hundred and thirty people aboard this ship. You're the only one that passed out, and I want to know why."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mira,,"I want to know why too. You're the doctor, you tell me. This is a new experience for me."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mccoy,,This whole thing is a new experience for all of us.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mira,,All of you are accustomed to new experiences. It's part of your work. I'm not.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Scott,,"She might have something there, Doctor McCoy. This is her first deep space trip, and you know that affects people."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Well, if we can get on with this, Scotty, we might make that determination. Now then, tell me. What did you feel before you passed out?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mira,,Nothing.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mccoy,,Nothing?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mira,,Absolutely nothing.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mccoy,,Lieutenant
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mira,,"Doctor, there is nothing more I can tell you."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Lieutenant, you're being completely unco-operative!"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mira,,Are you putting that into my record? It's not true.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I'll put the facts into your record, if I can get them."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Scott,,"Come on now, Mira. We must help the doctor. Tell us what happened."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mccoy,,Perhaps you can explain to her that any career she hopes for in Starfleet requires discipline and co-operation.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Scott,,"I'm sure that's what the lieutenant wants. She just didn't understand. Did you now, lass?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,,McCoy leaves,
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Chapel,,"With a bedside manner like that, Scotty, you're in the wrong business."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,,Chapel leaves,
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mira,,"When the record of this is forwarded, I'll be sent back, won't I."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Scott,,"Oh, you will not! That's ridiculous. This getting used to space travel, that takes some doing. And not everybody takes to it."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mira,,Did you?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Scott,,"Well, me, that's different. I was practically born to it."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mira,,I want to continue.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Scott,,You will. You passed your Starfleet preliminary examinations. And this is just getting used to what you might call your space legs.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mira,,I hope that's all it is.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, I've plotted the storm's path."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Main screen projection.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"On its present course, it will hit Memory Alpha planetoid as it did us."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant, try and warn Memory Alpha of the proximity of that phenomena. Give me an ETA for its possible impact."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Chekov,,"I cannot, sir. It has the ability to change speed."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Uhura,,"Sir, I'm unable to establish contact with the planetoid. I'm hailing on all frequencies. No response."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,"It is of little consequence, Captain. Memory Alpha has no protective shields."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,No shields?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,"None, Captain. When the library complex was assembled, shielding was considered inappropriate to its totally academic purpose. Since the information on the Memory planet is available to everyone, special protection was deemed unnecessary."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Wonderful. I hope the storm is aware of that rationale.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Chekov,,Completing approach to planetoid.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"It is already over Memory Alpha, Captain! Its speed is incredible. It's hitting the planetoid."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Are we within orbit range, Mister Chekov?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Chekov,,Making final approach.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant, try and warn them of"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Uhura,,"I'm sorry, sir. I can't break through this interference."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, how many people are on Memory Alpha?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,"It varies with the number of scholars, researchers, and scientists from the various Federation planets who are using the computer complex."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Chekov,,"Captain, we are within orbit range."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Lock into orbit.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Chekov,,"Aye, sir."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"It is leaving Memory Alpha, Captain."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,"Sensors give no readings of generated energy from Memory Alpha, Captain."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Any life readings?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,None.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Let's find out what's going on down there. Kirk to Engineering. Mister Scott, report. Kirk to Engineering. Mister Scott. Where the devil is he? Scotty, report to the Bridge. Report to the Bridge. Have the transporter room stand by. I'm taking a landing party down."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, aye, sir."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Scott,,Scott here.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Scotty, where've you been? Where are you?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Scott,,In the Sickbay.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Are you sick?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Scott,,"Och, no. I was just checking on the lass. She's going to be fine now. There's nothing wrong with her."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Well, I'm relieved to hear your prognosis, Mister Scott. Is the doctor there with you, or will I find him in Engineering?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mccoy,,"McCoy here, Jim."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Kirk,,"Doctor, how's the girl?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Mccoy,,I think she's in good shape.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Kirk,,"Well, Mister Scott seems to agree with you. The two of you meet me in the transporter room on the double."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,,"McCoy and Scott leave, then we see in Mira's eye the sparkles and an image of a dead alien presumably on Memory Alpha",
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,sickbay,Narrator,,"Captain's log, supplemental, stardate 5725.6. The storm has cleared Memory Alpha. It is heading away at incredible speed. We have been unable to make contact with the planetoid. Its silence is ominous. We are beaming down to investigate."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Mccoy,,"Somehow, I find transporting into the darkness unnerving."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Kirk,,"Scotty, can you get us some more light?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Scott,,"I'm afraid this light'll have to do, Captain. The generator is inoperative."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Kirk,,"Damage report, Spock."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Spock,,"A disaster for the galaxy, Captain. The central brain is damaged. The memory core is burned out. The loss to the galaxy may be irretrievable."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Scott,,Captain!
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,,"They go into the next area and find the body we saw in Mira's eye, along with others.",
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Spock,,"A very faint life reading in the immediate vicinity, Captain."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Kirk,,Locate him and keep him alive. We need more information about this enemy.

73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Kirk,,"Bones, can you do something?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Mccoy,,"Not a thing, Jim. (the woman's mouth is moving) The same garbled sounds Lieutenant Romaine made when she fainted after the storm."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Kirk,,Are you sure?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Mccoy,,Absolutely sure.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise.

73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Kirk,,Bones?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Mccoy,,She's dead.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Kirk,,What did she die of?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Mccoy,,"Severe brain haemorrhaging due to distortion of all neural systems, dissolution of autonomic nervous system. All basic personality factors, Captain."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Spock,,The attack was thorough.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Kirk,,What did the others die of?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Mccoy,,"Each had a different centre of brain destroyed, cause unknown."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Kirk,,"A different centre of the brain, you say?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Mccoy,,"Yes, Captain. I can be more detailed when we return to the ship and use the ship's computers."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,,Mira beams in,

73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Mira,,What did I say?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Kirk,,I don't know. The words were unfamiliar to me.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Mira,,What did it sound like?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Kirk,,They sounded exactly like the last words spoken by the technician.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Mira,,What technician?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Mccoy,,"We found one person in there just barely alive. The rest were dead, and we"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,,Mira runs to see,

73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Mira,,We must get back to the ship!
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Kirk,,Why? Tell me why.

73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Kirk,,How do you know?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Mira,,I know. You'll be killed if we stay.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Spock,,"Lieutenant, I assure you that unexplained phenomenon was headed away from the planet. It is probably seeking other victims."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Mira,,I tell you t will kill us.

73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Kirk,,Kirk here.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Sulu,,"Bridge, sir. The storm has reappeared on the long range scanner and is closing fast."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Kirk,,What's its course?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Sulu,,Coming back in this direction.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,memory alpha,Kirk,,Beam us up.

73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,transporter room,Scott,,"Wait, Captain. We've lost Mira."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,transporter room,Kirk,,"Delay that order, Mister Sulu!"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,transporter room,Scott,,Stabilise her!
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,transporter room,Kyle,,"Something's interfering with the transporter signal. I have her co-ordinates, but she's suspended in transit."

73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,transporter room,Kirk,,"All right, Mister Sulu, get us out of here. Mister Scott, check emergency manual monitor for transporter control."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, it's changing course."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Plot the new course, Mister Chekov."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Chekov,,Present course is one two six mark twenty.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Plot it.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Narrator,,"Present course will bring it across our starboard side, sir."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, you made a statement that phenomenon is not a storm. Explain."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,No known conditions in space would support that type of natural phenomenon.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,What is it?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,I'm having difficulty with the ship's sensors. They seem to be under selective attack by the phenomenon as the unfortunate occupants of Memory Alpha were.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Then deductive reasoning will have to be substituted.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,Ship's sensors are operating at the moment. Perhaps the elusive creature will now reveal something about itself.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Mira,,"I saw those men dead, in their exact positions!"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Scott,,"Listen to me. I've told you what strange tricks a space trip can play on your mind. Now, that's all it is."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Mira,,"No, Scotty."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Scott,,Have you ever had visions of the future events before this?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Mira,,Never.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Scott,,"Well, if you ask me, nobody ever has. That seeing to the future, it's pure bunk. You know that, don't you?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Mira,,I've always believed it.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Scott,,And you were perfectly right.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Mira,,"Then what is it, Scotty? What's frightening me? Ever since that storm hit, I've, I've had such strange thoughts, such feelings of terror."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Scott,,"Space. Space, that's all it is."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Mira,,Then I don't have to report it?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Scott,,"Well, if you want to spend the rest of the trip in Sickbay. But what good would that do? Doctor McCoy can no more cure it than he can a cold."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, it's heading straight for us."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Activate shields.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,Shields activated.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov, change course to one four three mark three."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Chekov,,One four three mark three.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Storm's course, Mister Sulu?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,One four three mark three.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Take evasive action.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,Evasive action.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Hard starboard, two one seven mark five."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"Two one seven mark five. Still with us, sir."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Hard port, one one seven mark two."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"One one seven mark two. Still with us, sir!"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Is it closing?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,"Negative, Captain. Maintaining its distance. However, it is matching each manoeuvre we execute, and I am receiving increasing magnitude of energy."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Your analysis, Spock. What is it?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,"Not what is it, Captain. What are they? There are ten distinct life units within it, all powerfully alive and vital."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Who are they? Where are they from?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,Impossible to determine without programming for computer analysis.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,It's clear we can't outrun them. Can we shield against them?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,I do not believe the Enterprise shields would prove an effective defence.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,There must be some defence we can use.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, we are dealing with a community of life units. Their attack is in the form of brain waves directed against the brain, which is most compatible."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Maybe we can avoid another attack. Lieutenant Uhura, open all channels. Tie in the universal translator. Mister Spock says it's alive. Maybe I can talk to it."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Uhura,,All channels open. Translator tied in.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise. We wish you no harm. Physical contact between us is fatal to our life forms. Please, do not come any closer to our ship."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,Perhaps it did not understand.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, change in velocity recorded. They are passing our starboard side and manoeuvreing in front of us. Switching to forward scanner. Captain, change in velocity recorded. It has accelerated its approach."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Mira,,"Help, Scotty!"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Scott,,What?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Mira,,Hold me. It's happening again. No!
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Scott,,Mira.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Perhaps it understands another kind of language. Condition Red Alert. Prepare for phaser firing.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Scott,,Mira.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Mira,,"No, Scotty. No! No."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,,Scott holds her close,
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Lock in phaser tracking controls.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Narrator,,"Locked in, sir."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Adjust phasers to fire across its course. Do not hit it.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"Locked in, sir."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Fire. Reaction, Mister Sulu?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"None, sir. They're still approaching us."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Apparently a shot across the bow is insufficiently convincing. Prepare to lock phasers into the heart of the community.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"Locked in, sir."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Fire.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,,"Mira falls to the floor, clutching her stomach in pain",
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Mira,,Scotty!
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Scott,,Mira! Mira.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,The phasers seem to have stopped their approach. They're holding position.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Lock in for another blast.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"Locked in, sir."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Scott,,"Captain! Captain, the phaser shots, they're killing Mira!"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Killing Lieutenant Romaine?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,engineering,Scott,,"Aye. When you fired the phasers, they stunned her and she crumpled."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Scott,,Another shot and you'll kill her!
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Get her to Sickbay at once.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"Ready for firing, Captain."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Cancel that order. Another attack on that alien life form will kill Lieutenant Romaine.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,It appears so.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"If she is to survive, we can't attack."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,Not directly.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Can the computer supply a defence based on the data you've been accumulating?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Spock,,"Negative, Captain. I have not been able to gather sufficient data for that. Captain, there is only one possible defence. If we can find an environment which is deadly to the alien form."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,And yet isolate the girl from its deadly effects. Captain Kirk to Doctor McCoy.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Mccoy,,"Yes, Captain."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,Is the girl well enough to be questioned?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Mccoy,,I can have her ready in a few minutes.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Kirk,,"Have the Lieutenant and Mister Scott in the briefing room as quickly as possible. Bring all available biographical material with you. Kirk out. Mister Spock, come with me."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Go easy on her, Jim. She's in a pretty bad state."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,I'll try.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,,Scott and Mira enter,
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,Lieutenant Romaine.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mira,,"I didn't mean to be unco-operative, Doctor."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mccoy,,Of course you didn't. I told the Captain.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,We must get to understand what is happening.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mira,,I'll tell you everything I know.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,Ship's investigative procedures are sometimes confusing to a new crewman. Don't let us upset you.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mira,,I trust all of you implicitly. I want to help.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,"This investigation has been prompted by two events. First is the time you passed out on the Bridge, and the second is when we fired our main phasers into that force that is attacking us and seriously injured you."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mira,,You mustn't worry about hurting me.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,"Now this is how we'll proceed. Mister Spock has all the information available to us about our attackers. Doctor McCoy has access to Starfleet's exhaustive files on you. A comparison of the two may turn up some improbable connection which may protect you and ourselves. All right, gentlemen? Doctor McCoy, will you proceed?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Romaine, Mira. Lieutenant. Place of birth, Martian Colony Number Three. Parents, Lydia Romaine, deceased. Jacques Romaine, chief engineer, Starfleet, retired."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, are you prepared with the background history of the attackers?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Spock,,"I am, Captain. I have fed all obtainable data to the main computer. It should be ready to supply whatever conclusions are possible."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,"Thank you. Mister Sulu, what is the status of our friends?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Sulu,,Status unchanged. They're still with us and keeping the same distance.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,"Continue evasive manoeuvres. Keep me informed. Kirk out. Doctor, do you have a medical record of Lieutenant Romaine available?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Yes, Captain."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,I'd like a few items from her psychological profile checked. Any history of psychosomatic illness?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mccoy,,Occasional and teenage routine incidents.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,Any evidence of involuntary or unconscious telepathic abilities?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mccoy,,None.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,Any pathological or unusual empathic responses?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mccoy,,"No, Captain, not empathic. However, an extremely flexible and pliant response to new learning situations is highly marked."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,"Go ahead, Doctor."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mccoy,,"After our phasers hit that thing, I gave Lieutenant Romaine a standard Steinman analysis. The results might be interesting."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,Go ahead.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mccoy,,"The comparison of our Steinman with Starfleet records shows that Lieutenant Romaine's fingerprints, voice analysis, all external factors remain exactly the same as before. However, according to two hyperencephalograms, her brain wave pattern has been altered."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,That's impossible!
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mccoy,,That's what I was taught. But the BCP is just as consistent as fingerprints.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,Let's see it.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,,A jagged graph comes up on the monitor. Spock raises an eyebrow,
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Spock,,"Doctor McCoy, according to your records, Lieutenant Romaine showed no abnormal telepathic powers."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mccoy,,"That's right, Spock. But exceptional pliancy was indicated. That might be a factor."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Spock,,And you are sure that this is the correct slide?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Yes, Mister Spock. That is tape deck D, brain circuitry pattern of Lieutenant Mira Romaine."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Spock,,"Gentlemen, it also happens to be tape H, the impulse tracking obtained from the alien life units."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mccoy,,Nurse Chapel followed this every step of the way. There can be no error.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,"Check it, Spock."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,,"Spock puts his computer disc in, and the two patterns overlap and match exactly.",
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Spock,,"As I said, Captain, this is the tracking obtained during the last shielded run. Computer, run a detailed comparison brain circuitry patterns, tape D and tape H."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Computer,,"Comparison tape D's brain circuitry patterns of Lieutenant Mira Romaine and tape H, brain circuitry patterns of alien life unit, identical. Identical."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Spock,,Fascinating.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mccoy,,There has been no error.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Spock,,"Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. There is an identity of minds taking place between the alien beings and the mind of Lieutenant Romaine. Their thoughts are becoming hers."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,Bridge to Captain Kirk.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Sulu,,The alien is no longer maintaining its distance.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,Continue evasive action. Keep me informed. Kirk out.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Scott,,Mira has tried to tell me all along that she was seeing things in advance.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,Why didn't you report it?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Scott,,You don't report space sickness. That's all I thought it was.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,What did she see?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Scott,,"The first attack on the ship, the attack on Memory Alpha and the time we nearly lost her."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,Those were all acts carried out by our attacker.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Scott,,And? And?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,"Yes, Scotty? What else?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Scott,,"I thought for a moment there was something else, but I guess I was wrong."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,"Was he wrong, Lieutenant?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mira,,"Yes, there was one other time."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,What did you see?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mira,,I saw Scotty.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,Where?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mira,,I don't know.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,What was he doing?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mira,,"He was dying. Now I understand what's been happening. I've been seeing through another mind. I've been flooded with thoughts not my own that control me. Oh, Scotty, Scotty! I'd rather die than hurt you. I'd rather die."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Narrator,,"SCOTT@ All right, now. What's all this talk of dying? They've called the turn on us three out of four times. Now, that's a better average than anybody deserves. It's our turn now. We'll fight them. So let's not hear anything more about dying."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,Kirk here.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Sulu,,"Sulu, Captain. All evasion tactics carried out as ordered."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,What success did you have?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Sulu,,"It's been useless, Captain."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Spock,,"At their present force, they will get through the shields this time, Captain."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,"Warp eight, Mister Sulu."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Sulu,,"Yes, sir."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,"They'll be here very soon. They may destroy you and us as they did Memory Alpha. You are especially susceptible to their will. But we have one chance to survive. Don't resist. Let them begin to function through you. If we can control that moment, we have a chance. Will you try?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Mira,,Tell me what to do.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,Captain Kirk to medical lab.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Crewman,,"Medical lab here, sir."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,briefing room,Kirk,,Prepare the antigrav test units. Let's go.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,bridge,Sulu,,"Attention. All personnel, attention. Alien force has penetrated the ship."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,corridor,Sulu,,"Take defensive action. Attention, all personnel. The alien being has penetrated the ship. Take defensive action."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,corridor,Security,,General quarters. Security condition three. Intruder alert. Repeat. General quarters. Security condition three. Intruder alert.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,"As soon as she has entered the gravity chamber, secure all ports."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,,The pretty lights enter the room,
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Mira,,"Don't touch me, Scotty! Stay away."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,,Then enter Mira. She changes colour and makes the strange noise,
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Scott,,We've lost her to them.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,Stay where you are.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Mccoy,,She could kill us all in this state.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Spock,,"She will, unless we are able to complete what the captain has planned."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Scott,,"Stay with us, Mira. Please stay."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Mira,,I'm trying. I want to be with you. They are too strong.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,Don't lose yourself to them. Hold on.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Mira,,"I am Mira Romaine. I will be who I choose to be. I will. Stay away, Scotty! They are with me. They will kill you."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Scott,,You won't let them.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Zetar,through Mira,She cannot stop us. You cannot prevent it.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Scott,,Mira. Mira! Captain.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,That's not Mira talking.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Spock,,"Captain, we must deal with them directly, now, while she still retains partial identity. We can speak to them. They will answer using her voice."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,I'm Captain James Kirk of the spaceship Enterprise. Do you understand?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Zetar,,"Yes, we understand you. We have searched for a millennium for one through whom we can see and speak and hear and live out our lives."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,Who are you?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Zetar,,We are from Zetar.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Spock,,That is one of the planets where all humanoid life was destroyed.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,You can't be from Zetar. All life was destroyed there long ago.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Zetar,,"Yes, all corporeal life was destroyed."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,Then what are you?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Zetar,,"The desires, the hopes, the mind and the will of the last hundred of Zetar. The force of our life could not be wiped out."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,All things die.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Zetar,,"At the proper time. Our planet was dying. We were determined to live on. At the peak of our plans to go, a sudden final disaster struck us down. But the force of our lives survived. At last we have found someone through whom we can live it out."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,The body of the one you inhabit has its own life to lead.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Zetar,,She will accept ours.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,She will not. She is fighting for her own identity.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Zetar,,Her mind will accept our thoughts. Our lives will be fulfilled.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,Will she learn the way people on Memory Alpha learned?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Zetar,,We did not wish to kill.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,But you did kill!
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Zetar,,No. Resisting us killed those people. We did not kill them.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,The price of your survival is too high.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Zetar,,We only want the girl.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,"You can't have her. You're entitled to your own life, but not another's."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Mira,,Life was given to me. It is mine. I want to live it out. I will
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Mccoy,,The girl's life reading is becoming a match to the Zetarians. She's losing.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Zetar,,Do not fight us.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Spock,,They will not accept their own deaths.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,They'll be forced to accept it.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Zetar,,You will all die.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Spock,,"Captain, if we cannot complete the plan, they will carry out their threat."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,We must get her into the pressure chamber.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Mccoy,,"Jim, you realize the pressure needed to kill the Zetars might kill the girl too."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Scott,,Mira will not kill me.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,,Scott picks her up and gets her into the chamber before being thrown across the room,
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Scott,,I told you she wouldn't kill me.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,Secure the chamber. Neutralise gravity.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Mccoy,,The Zetars are growing stronger.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Spock,,The weightless state has become their natural condition.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,"Pressurise the unit. Bring pressure to two atmospheres and then increase one atmosphere per second. Continue increasing pressure. Pressure, Spock. Pressure."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Mccoy,,"The pressure is dangerously high, Captain. It may damage her."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,"Continue, Spock."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,,The lights leave Mira,
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Kirk,,Pressure!
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,,The lights fizzle away,
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Mccoy,,"We've done it, Jim. They're gone."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Scott,intercom,"It's all right, Mira. They're gone. They're gone!"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,,She looks at him and smiles,
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Mccoy,,"Reduce the pressure very, very gradually, Spock."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Spock,,"We may tax Mister Scott's patience, Doctor."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Mccoy,,"Lie perfectly still, Lieutenant. Try not to move at all. Take deep, regular breaths. Now, don't hold it. Continue to breathe deeply. In, out. In, out. That's it. Now, you'll be in there another twenty minutes, so why don't you just try to relax?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,medical lab,Scott,,Now we have all the time in the world.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Kirk,,"Bones, are you able to judge the long range effects on Lieutenant Romaine?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"When the personality of a human is involved, exact predictions are hazardous."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Spock,,"Particularly where humans are involved, Doctor."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"However, despite Starfleet judgment of the pliancy of the Lieutenant, she put up a valiant struggle to retain her identity, and I find that encouraging."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Spock,,"Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. While the truth was difficult to accept, when it was revealed, the girl reacted well. I would say her struggle in this experience would strengthen her entire ego structure."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Kirk,,Would either of you credit Scotty's steadfast belief in her as a factor?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Spock,,"You mean, love as motivation? Humans do claim a great deal for that particular emotion. I suppose it is possible. However"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"There are no howevers about it, Mister Spock. It was a factor, and it will be a factor in the girl's recovery."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Kirk,,Do I take it both of you agree that Lieutenant Romaine need not return to Starbase for further treatment?
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,"Well, I should think work would be a better therapy."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Spock,,Logical.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Kirk,,Captain Kirk to Mister Scott.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Scott,,"Scott here, sir."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Kirk,,"Mister Scott, how's Lieutenant Romaine?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Scott,,"Beautiful, Captain."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Kirk,,"Yes, Mister Scott. Do I take it you say that she is fit for duty?"
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Scott,,"Positively, Captain."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Kirk,,Thank you. Kirk to Bridge.
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Sulu,,"Sulu, Captain."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Kirk,,"Mister Sulu, set course for Memory Alpha. Lieutenant Romaine has a lot of work to do there."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Sulu,,"Yes, sir."
73,3,The Lights Of Zetar,mccoy's office,Kirk,,"Well, this is an Enterprise first. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock and Engineer Scott find themselves in complete agreement. Can I stand the strain?"

74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Kirk,dictating,"At Federation orders, we're proceeding at top warp speed to the planet Ardana, where the only source of zenite exists. It is the one substance that can halt the plague."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain, the High Advisor of Ardana is ready to receive you on Stratos, sir."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Kirk,,"On Stratos? That's their cloud city, isn't it, Mister Spock?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Spock,,"It is, Captain."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Kirk,,There must be some mistake. Do you have the co-ordinates to the mine entrance available?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Spock,,"They've already been provided to the transport officer, Captain. Along with those of the council chamber of the High Advisor."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Kirk,,Kirk to transporter room.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Scott,,"Ready to transport, Captain."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Scott, are you locked in on the mine entrance or on their cloud city, Stratos?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Scott,,"The mine entrance. That's what you ordered, Captain."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Kirk,,"Fine. Uhura. Tell the High Advisor that we request to dispense with the welcoming ceremonies due to the emergency, and that we're beaming directly down to the mine entrance in order to ensure the fastest possible delivery of the zenite. The need is urgent."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, come with me. Oh, and tell them that we appreciate the honour and that we look forward to some visit in the future."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."

74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Kirk,,"Looks as tranquil as its reputation, doesn't it."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Spock,,"It is one of the most interesting metropolises in the galaxy. Have you ever visited here, Captain?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Kirk,,Once. I didn't have time to look around.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Spock,,"I've never had the opportunity. However, I hear its art forms are incomparable."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Kirk,,"Yes, art is the population's chief occupation."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Spock,,It is a totally intellectual society. All forms of violence have been eliminated.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Kirk,,There's the mine entrance. The zenite consignment should have been there. I don't understand it. Those Troglyte miners were supposed to have made delivery when we beamed down.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Spock,,"Perhaps there is another entrance, Captain."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Kirk,,Perhaps.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Spock,,It would seem the Troglytes have changed their minds about delivery.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,,Kirk and Spock are lassoed by three people in boiler suits and hard hats.,
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Kirk,,Who are you? What's the meaning of this attack?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Vanna,a woman in blue,"Interference breeds attack, Captain. Come on!"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Kirk,,We're here by permission of your government council on an emergency mission.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Vanna,,"Move on, Captain!."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,,"There is a fight, two against four. Then three figures beam down onto the platform.",

74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Plasus,,"Are you harmed, gentlemen?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Kirk,,"No, just a little shaken up."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Plasus,,"I'm Plasus, High Advisor of the planet council."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Kirk,,"Captain Kirk, Enterprise. My first officer, Mister Spock."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Spock,,"Greetings, Mister Advisor."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Plasus,,My regrets for the unpleasantness of your welcome to Ardana.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Kirk,,It was rather warm.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Plasus,,"Unfortunately, violence is habitual with the Troglytes. But I assure you, this insult will not go unpunished."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Kirk,,"Well, I'm more concerned with the zenite consignment. Why wasn't it in its specified location?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Plasus,,"Apparently the Disrupters have confiscated it, as I knew they would."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Spock,,The Disrupters? Who are they?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Plasus,,A small group of Troglyte malcontents. All the other Troglytes are completely dominated by them. It's the Disrupters who are responsible for their refusal to continue mining for zenite.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Kirk,,They agreed to the delivery. Your council assured us of it.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Plasus,,They agreed obviously as a ruse to get valuable hostages.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Kirk,,Hostages? For what purpose?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Plasus,,To force the council to meet their demands. (to guards) Organise a search party immediately and find the zenite consignment.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,,Guards leave,
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Plasus,,"Meanwhile, Captain, I would suggest that you and First Officer Spock be our guests on Stratos."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Kirk,,"Very well. I do hope the search will be brief, Mister Advisor."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine entrance,Plasus,,"We'll do everything possible to make it so. Come, gentlemen."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,,"Plasus, Kirk and Spock beam onto a balcony at the edge of Stratos, with a wonderful view of a brown river and its tributaries.",
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Spock,,Remarkable. The finest example of sustained antigravity elevation I've ever seen.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Droxine,,"The sentinel told me of our honoured guests, my father. I came to extend greetings."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,"A most gracious act. One of our planet's most incomparable works of art. My daughter, Droxine. Captain James Kirk."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Kirk,,"Pleasure, madam."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Droxine,,"Indeed, yes, Captain."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,And First Officer Spock.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Droxine,,"I have never before met a Vulcan, sir."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Spock,,"Nor I a work of art, madam."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,"Come, gentlemen. There is much to see in our city. This is our council gallery. It is open to all city dwellers. We have some of the finest of our various art forms assembled here for the viewing and contemplation of every"

74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,Disrupters again.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Droxine,,How dreadful!. They're despoiling the whole city.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Spock,,Despoil? For what purpose?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,"By keeping us in constant turmoil, they hope to force the council to accede to their demands."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Kirk,,What are their demands?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,"Completely unreasonable, Captain, but nothing you need be concerned with."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Kirk,,I must concern myself with it if it should interfere with the delivery of zenite to Merak Two.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Spock,,"Mister Advisor, the plant life is the source of oxygen on that planet. Obviously, if all plant life is destroyed, the humanoid life will follow."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,"I assure you, gentlemen, you will get what you came for."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Kirk,,"I hope so. Ardana is a member of the Federation, and it is your council's responsibility that nothing interferes with its obligation to another member of the Federation."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,"Of course, and we accept the responsibility."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Spock,,But why do they destroy art forms? That is a loss to everyone.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,Art means nothing to the Disrupters. This (the dagger) is the only form they understand. The disturbances accompanying your arrival have been most wearying. No doubt you would like to rest.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Spock,,"That would be most welcome, Mister Advisor."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,Chambers have been prepared for you. A sentinel will guide you to them.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,,Kirk and Spock leave,
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Droxine,,I'm sorry they were so poorly treated on their first visit to our planet.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,It's fortunate that they were not seriously hurt.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Droxine,,"Oh, yes, that would have been dreadful."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,Further violence could create grave difficulties between Ardana and the Federation.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Droxine,,The Disrupters must be mad to attack two such charming strangers.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,They grow more daring and determined every day. Now they seek to find allies in the galaxy.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Droxine,,Do you think that Captain Kirk and his very attractive officer will feel that we're responsible for their injuries?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,All this time I thought you were worried about our diplomatic relations.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,,Two sentinels drag in a Troglyte,
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Sentinel,,"Apologies, Mister Advisor, but this Troglyte was apprehended leaving the city. He is without a transport card so we thought you would want to question him."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,Remove his shields.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,,The sentinel takes off the troglyte's sunglasses,
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,"What is your business in Stratos, Troglyte? Speak! I command you!"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Troglyte,,My business is to repair.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,Repair what?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Troglyte,,There are damaged entrance panels.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,Indeed. Then you must have a repair permit. Where is it?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Troglyte,,It was forgotten.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,Did you also forget your transport card?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Troglyte,,It was lost when your sentinels attacked me.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,And where was your cavern implement lost? Could this perhaps be it?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Troglyte,,I came to make repairs.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,And you shall make them by giving us the names of the Disrupters.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Troglyte,,I know nothing.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,I would advise you to increase your knowledge.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Troglyte,,That is not possible for a Troglyte. The Stratos city dwellers have said it.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,Secure him to the rostrum.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,,But the troglyte breaks free of the sentinels and jumps over the balcony instead.,
74,3,The Cloud Minders,stratos - council gallery,Plasus,,How unfortunate. How unfortunate.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,,"Kirk is sleeping, Spock is meditating.",
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Spock,,"This troubled planet is a place of the most violent contrasts. Those who receive the rewards are totally separated from those who shoulder the burdens. It is not a wise leadership. Here on Stratos, everything is incomparably beautiful and pleasant. The High Advisor's charming daughter Droxine, particularly so. The name Droxine seems appropriate for her. I wonder, can she retain such purity and sweetness of mind and be aware of the life of the people on the surface of the planet? There, the harsh life in the mines is instilling the people with a bitter hatred. The young girl who led the attack against us when we beamed down was filled with the violence of desperation. If the lovely Droxine knew of the young miner's misery, I wonder how the knowledge would affect her."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,,Spock hears a sound and goes into the next room. Droxine is preparing refreshments.,
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,,"Mister Spock, I thought you had accompanied Captain Kirk to the rest chamber."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Spock,,Your movements awakened me.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,,My apologies. I did not realise they would disturb you.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Spock,,Only Vulcan ears would find the noise discernible.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,,It seems that Vulcans are fascinatingly different in many ways.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Spock,,The same may be said of Stratos inhabitants.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,,"Vulcan eyes are very discerning too. I hear that, intellectually, Vulcans are as highly evolved as Stratos city dwellers."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Spock,,We do pride ourselves on our logic.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,,"Dressed in Stratos fashion, the female miner enters the rest room, armed with her mining tool. She leans over Kirk, but he grabs her, pulls her down onto the bed and disarms her.",
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Kirk,,You again!
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Vanna,,"You sleep lightly, Captain."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Kirk,,"Yes, duty is a good teacher. I see you've changed your dressmaker."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Vanna,,Release me.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Kirk,,So you can attack me again? That would be foolish.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Vanna,,"Call the guards if you're afraid, Captain."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Kirk,,"I'm not afraid. In fact, I find this rather enjoyable."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Vanna,,I do not!
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Kirk,,"All right, I'll make a deal with you. You answer some questions and I'll let you up."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Vanna,,What questions?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Kirk,,Your word first.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Vanna,,I will answer.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,,"But as soon as he lets go, she grabs for the weapon again and he has to fight her again.",
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,,"Meanwhile, in the next room, the ears that heard Droxine don't hear the fighting",
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,,You only take a mate once every seven years?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Spock,,"The seven-year cycle is biologically inherent in all Vulcan's. At that time, the mating drive outweighs all other motivations."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,,"And is there nothing that can disturb that cycle, Mister Spock?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Spock,,"Extreme feminine beauty is always disturbing, madam."

74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Vanna,,"I did not come here to kill you, Captain."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Kirk,,Then why this?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Vanna,,To take you hostage.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Narrator,,Spock and Droxine enter)
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Spock,,"Am I intruding, Captain?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,,Vanna!
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Vanna,,Droxine.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,,Why have you come here?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Vanna,,To welcome our honoured guests as I was taught to do when I served in your father's household.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,,"Has she injured you, Captain?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Kirk,,"No, not at all. In fact her visit was quite enlightening."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,,Oh?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Kirk,,"Yes, it seems the Troglytes are under the impression that the Enterprise is here to intimidate them."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,into intercom,Send a sentinel to the rest chamber immediately.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Vanna,,"It is not impression, Captain. It is the truth."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Kirk,,"We're here to get that zenite consignment, and that's it."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Vanna,,Starships do not transport cargo.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Kirk,,"In times of emergency, they do anything. And believe me, this botanical plague is an emergency."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Vanna,,"Lies will not keep the Troglytes in the caverns, and neither will your starship."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,,"You talk like a Disrupter, Vanna."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Vanna,,I speak for my people. They have as much right to the clouds as the Stratos dwellers.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,,But Stratos is for advisors and studiers. What would Troglytes do here?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Vanna,,"Live in the sunlight and warmth, as everyone should."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,,"The caverns are warm and your eyes are not accustomed to light, just as your minds are not accustomed to logic."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,,A sentinel takes Vanna away,
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Kirk,,"Unaccustomed to light and warmth? That's necessary to all humanoids. Surely, you don't deny it to the Troglytes."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,,"The Troglytes are workers, Captain. Oh surely, you must be aware of that. They mine zenite for shipment, till the soil. Those things cannot be done here."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Spock,,"In other words, they perform all the physical toil necessary to maintain Stratos."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,,That is their function in our society.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Spock,,But they are not allowed to share its advantages.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,,How can they share what they do not understand?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Kirk,,"They can be taught to understand, especially in a society that prides itself in enlightenment."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,,"The complete separation of toil and leisure has given Ardana this perfectly balanced social system, Captain. Why should we change it?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Spock,,The surface of the planet is almost unendurable. To restrict a segment of the population to such hardship is unthinkable in an evolved culture.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accommodation,Droxine,,"The surface is marred by violence, like the Troglytes. But here in Stratos, we have completely eliminated violence."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,,Vanna is shackled to a granite-looking device,
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,You still refuse to disclose the names of the other Disrupters.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Vanna,,There are no Disrupters!
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,"Very well, if you prefer the rays."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,,"The curved section of the device, facing Vanna, lights up and makes Vanna glow.",
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accomodation,,The sound of the rays can be heard in the background,
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accomodation,Spock,,Troglyte is an abbreviation of an ancient Earth term. Its technical translation is cave dweller.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accomodation,Kirk,,"Yes, I should have realised."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,guest accomodation,,A scream rings out. Kirk and Spock go to investigate,
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Kirk,,Mister Advisor!
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,,"The rays are switched off, and Vanna slumps",
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Kirk,,"You said you were going to question Vanna, not torture her."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,"She's stubborn, and as you yourself pointed out, Captain, the search for your zenite consignment must be short."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Kirk,,Surely there are better methods than this.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,"Physical discomfort is extremely persuasive, Captain."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Kirk,,"Yes, but I won't stand by while someone is tortured!"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,Is it preferable to spare Vanna and allow an entire planet to be destroyed?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Spock,,"Violence in reality is quite different from theory, is it not, madam?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Droxine,,"But what else can they understand, Mister Spock?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Spock,,"All the little things you and I understand and expect from life, such as equality, kindness, justice."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,"Troglytes are not like Stratos dwellers, Mister Spock. They're a conglomerate of inferior species. The abstract concepts of an intellectual society are beyond their comprehension."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Kirk,,The abstract concepts of loyalty and leadership seem clear to Vanna.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,"A few Troglytes are brought here as retainers. Vanna was one of them, as are the sentinels. They've received more training than the others."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Kirk,,But obviously no more consideration.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,I fail to see the purpose of this continued criticism.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Kirk,,The only way you'll use that device again is on one of us.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,"An imposing display of primitive gallantry, gentlemen. You realise, of course, that the sentinels could remove you."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Kirk,,"Of course, but Starfleet command won't take kindly to having either rays or physical force used against one of its command personnel, Mister Advisor."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,Why are you so concerned with this Disrupter's well-being?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Kirk,,"Beyond plain humanitarianism, my orders are to get that zenite."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,"Then stop interfering, and I'll get it for you."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Kirk,,You won't get it through torture.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,"We will get it for you, and in our own way. Remove the prisoner to confinement quarters. You will return to your ship at once or I shall contact your Starfleet command myself and report your interference with this planet's government."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Scott,,"Enterprise, Captain."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Kirk,,"Mister Scott, we're ready to beam up."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Scott,,"Aye, sir."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,,Kirk and Spock are beamed away,
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,to sentinel,"If Captain Kirk appears again, kill him."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Narrator,,"Captain's log, star date 5819.0. More than eight hours have passed since the consignment of zenite disappeared and we have still found no trace of it. We've received word from Merak Two that the plague is spreading rapidly. Delivery of the zenite is imperative within twelve hours or all life on the planet will be annihilated."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant Uhura, advise Starfleet command that the zenite has not been delivered. In my opinion, Plasus' method of accomplishing delivery will not succeed. If the zenite is not delivered shortly, I shall have to violate Plasus' order of non-interference and win the confidence of the Troglyte leader with the use of reason."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Mccoy,,"That may not be easy, Jim. Medical analysis indicates the Troglytes are mentally inferior."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Kirk,,"That's impossible, Bones. The Troglytes have accepted personal sacrifice, a common cause. Mentally inferior beings aren't capable of that."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Mccoy,,"Look, I've checked my findings thoroughly. Their intellect ratings are almost twenty percent below average."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Spock,,But they're all the same species. Those who live on Stratos and those who live below all originated on the planet. Their physical and mental evolution must be similar. That is basic biological law.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Mccoy,,"That's true, Spock, but obviously the ancestors of those who live on Stratos removed themselves from the environment of the mines. Therefore they avoided the effects of certain natural growths."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Kirk,,Natural growths? What kind?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well. I had this zenite sample sent up from the surface. Now unsealed, it would have had detrimental effects on everybody here."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Spock,,Incredible. Zenite is shipped all over the galaxy wherever there is danger of plant bacteria. No side effects have ever been reported.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Mccoy,,"There are none after it's refined. But in its raw state, it emits a odourless, invisible gas that retards the intellectual functioning of the mind and heightens the emotional. Therefore, it releases a violent reaction."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Kirk,,And the mines are full of that gas.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Mccoy,,That's right. And the Troglytes are constantly exposed to it.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Kirk,,"Bones, the Disrupters, Vanna. It seems impossible. They've outwitted a highly organised, scientific culture for months."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Spock,,"As part of the staff of Stratos, Vanna was removed from exposure for a long period. It is likely that without such exposure, the effect slowly wears off."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Mccoy,,"That's right, Spock. The other Disrupters were probably removed from exposure too."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Kirk,,Does the brain return to normal?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Mccoy,,"According to findings, it should."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Kirk,,Can you neutralise the gas?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Mccoy,,"No, but a filter mask should remove the exposure."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Kirk,,Find one. Meet us in the transporter room.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,,"Kirk, Spock and McCoy are talking to Plasus on a wall monitor",
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Kirk,,"This mask automatically eliminates all substance injurious to humanoid life, chemical as well as bacterial. We have used these filter masks frequently on"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Plasus,,Do you really expect me to believe that that mask can achieve intellectual equality for the Troglytes?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Mccoy,,"There's every indication that the effect of the gas is temporary, even after repeated exposure."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Plasus,,How can a mere filter accomplish what centuries of evolution have failed to do?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Kirk,,Doctor McCoy has analysed the zenite thoroughly. We've checked his findings through the computer and they're absolutely valid.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Plasus,,"And do your computers explain how my ancestors, who also dwelt in caverns, evolved sufficiently to erect Stratos while the Troglytes did not?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Spock,,"Unequal evolution did not begin until after your ancestors removed themselves from constant exposure to the gas, Mister Advisor."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Plasus,,Preposterous.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Kirk,,There's no time to argue about the findings now. I simply propose to tell Vanna all about them.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Plasus,,I doubt whether even Vanna will believe such nonsense!
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Kirk,,This nonsense might mean a great deal to the Troglytes. I would like to offer them a supply of these filter masks in exchange for the zenite consignment.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Plasus,,"I'm sorry, Captain. Such an offer could only cause more unrest among them. I cannot allow it until our scientists have checked the findings."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Mccoy,,But that could take days.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Kirk,,Are you afraid the filter masks will work? Is that why you don't want the Troglytes to try them?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Plasus,,"You are here to complete an emergency mission, not conduct tests, Captain."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Kirk,,"I am here to get that zenite. If these will help me get them, I'll use them."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Plasus,,And I forbid it. Your Federation orders do not entitle you to defy local governments. This communication has ended.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Kirk,,My diplomacy is somewhat inadequate.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Mccoy,,It's pretty hard to overcome prejudice.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Kirk,,"Doesn't give us much choice, does it."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Spock,,Nor much time. We have ten hours and forty minutes to deliver that consignment to Merak Two.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Kirk,,Beam me down to Vanna's confinement quarters.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Mccoy,,You mean you're going back to Stratos against government orders?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Kirk,,"If Vanna doesn't have something definite to gain for her people, she'll die rather than turn over that zenite consignment. This is the only thing that might convince her."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Spock,,"Captain, if you are apprehended deliberately violating the High Advisor's orders, he will be within his rights to have you executed, if he chooses."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Kirk,,"If you're about to suggest that you contact Vanna, the answer is negative, Spock. That goes for you too, Bones."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Spock,,Allow me to point out that a first officer is more expendable than either a doctor or a captain.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Kirk,,"Officially, yes. But this mission is strictly unofficial. Nobody's to have any part in it, any responsibility for it, but myself. That's an order, Spock. You have the conn. Stand by till I contact you."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,,"It's a fair size, with a bed and table, and horizontal bars across the doorway",
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,Kirk,,"Vanna, I've brought you a gift. There's a dangerous gas in the mines that affects the development of the Troglytes exposed to it for a period of time. This mask will prevent any further damage."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,Vanna,,Gas from zenite?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,Kirk,,Yes.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,Vanna,,It's hard to believe something which is neither seen nor felt can do so much harm.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,Kirk,,"That's true. But an idea can't be seen or felt. That's what's kept the Troglytes in the mines all these centuries, a mistaken idea."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,Vanna,,Would all the Troglytes wear these masks?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,Kirk,,Yes. I'll see to it that the Federation engineers construct them.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,Vanna,,Suppose Plasus does not agree?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,Kirk,,Plasus is not the whole government.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,Vanna,,"That is true, but the city council will not listen to Troglytes."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,Kirk,,"As soon as the zenite is delivered to Merak Two, I'll come back. I'll request permission to mediate for the Troglytes. Vanna, you must trust me. I give you my word."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,Vanna,,"Centuries ago, Stratos was built by leaders that gave their word that all inhabitants would live there. The Troglytes are still waiting."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,Kirk,,The zenite can be delivered in a few hours. You won't have long to wait now.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,Vanna,,"Hours can be centuries, just as words can be lies."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,Kirk,,"Vanna, you must trust me. If you don't, millions of people will die. A whole planet. This zenite is all that can save them. This filter mask is all that can save the Troglytes. Trust me. Please."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,Vanna,,"Very well, Captain. I will trust you. The consignment lies deep in the mines in a place known only to Troglytes. I cannot direct you. I must take you there. You asked for my trust, Captain. Are you unwilling to give yours?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,,They hear footsteps,
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,Vanna,,It's the sentinel with my refreshment.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,,"The sentinel enters, puts down the tray and picks up the mask. Kirk stuns him with his phaser.",
74,3,The Cloud Minders,vanna's cell,Vanna,,Wait. We'll need a transport pass to leave the city.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,,"Vanna leads Kirk though tunnels, then uses a tool to hit the rock three times. Other Troglytes appear.",
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,Midro.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Midro,,Vanna.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,Anka.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Anka,,You have returned.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,And I've brought with me a hostage. Seize him!
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Kirk,wearing the mask,We had a bargain. Why did you break it?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,"Did you really think I would trust you, Captain? I'm not such a fool."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Kirk,,I trusted you.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,You thought you would trick me with your talk of your filter and your unseen gas. I don't believe you any more than Plasus does.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Kirk,,"Then you are a fool. These masks will free you, just as I said."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,Our weapons are our freedom. And you've just furnished me with two very valuable ones. Yourself and this. (phaser)
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Kirk,,Holding me won't help you. My men'll still come for that zenite consignment.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,"Without your communicator, you will be hard to locate."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Kirk,,They'll still come.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,"Perhaps. In the meantime, a taste of our existence, Captain. Dig as the Troglytes do. As the Troglytes do."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Kirk,,"Without that mask, I haven't"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,"With your bare hands, Captain."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Narrator,,"Captain's log, supplemental, stardate 5819.3. First Officer Spock reporting. Captain Kirk beamed down to Stratos to attempt to win the confidence of the rebel Troglytes. Unless he has made his escape from Stratos to the mines, his life is in danger from the High Advisor. The captain has not informed us of his progress. For our part, we must maintain silence. We can be of no help to him without jeopardising his life."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,"You dig well, Captain. The unseen gas doesn't seem to be harming you."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Kirk,,It takes a while for its effects to be noticed.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,"Nevertheless, you won't be needing this. Anka, deposit this on the transport platform so Plasus will know we have something more valuable to bargain with than our mortaes and thongs."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Anka,,"You are clever, Vanna. Very clever."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,,Anka leaves,
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,"Searchers will be coming soon, Midro. Go to the other mines and tell the Troglytes to post watchers."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Midro,,What of him?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,I will see that he doesn't escape.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Midro,,"If we kill him, there will be no need to see."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,"A dead hostage is of no value, Midro."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Midro,,Only the Troglytes will know.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,I brought him here and I will say what is to be done.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Midro,,"You are not the only Disrupter. I, too, can say."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,Can you do nothing but argue? The searchers will be here soon.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Midro,,"When Anka returns, we will all say."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,,Midro leaves,
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Kirk,,"Is that what Disrupters are bargaining for, the right to kill everyone?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,Midro is a child.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Kirk,,The masks can change that.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,"Return to the digging, Captain."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Kirk,,"How long do you plan on keeping me here, providing Midro doesn't kill me, of course?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,Until we have help in the mines and our homes are in the clouds.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Kirk,,That's quite a while. Longer than I expected.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,,"Kirk jumps Vanna, gets the phaser and uses it to cause a rockfall in the tunnel",
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,We're sealed in!

74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,But soon the atmosphere will go. We'll die.

74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Spock,,"Spock here. We've been trying to make contact, Captain. Is anything wrong?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Kirk,,Nothing. Are you locked in on me?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Spock,,Locked in and ready to beam up consignment.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Kirk,,"Circumstances dictate a slight variation, Spock."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Spock,,Standing by for instructions.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Kirk,,"Hold on these co-ordinates. Locate the High Advisor and beam him to these co-ordinates immediately. Without advance communication. Repeat, without advance communication. Have you got that, Spock?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Spock,,Instructions clear. I shall carry them out immediately. Spock out.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Vanna,,You would seal Plasus here also? For what purpose?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Kirk,,I am preparing a demonstration on the effects of unbelieved gas.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Scott,,"Beam the High Advisor down without warning, did he say?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Spock,,"That's not an exact quote, Mister Scott. However, it does express the thought."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Scott,,I'd like to see the Advisor's face.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Spock,,You will have that opportunity.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Scott,,"The captain did say immediately, did he not?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Spock,,"Now that is an exact quote, Mister Scott, and I suggest you handle the transporter yourself. This could be very delicate as a problem in transporting for us and in diplomacy for the captain."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Scott,,Aye.

74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,What is it? Tell me.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Droxine,,"No, really. I'm not upset. I was just standing here looking into space and wondering whether or not he would return."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,He will never return. I've seen to that.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Droxine,,But the zenite is so important to him. He must have it.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,"It will be delivered. If we have to kill every Troglyte, it will be delivered."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Droxine,,"By that time, it may be too late. Perhaps he does have a method"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,"He knows nothing except how to destroy our power and our society. I forbid you ever to speak of Captain Kirk, or even to think of him."

74,3,The Cloud Minders,transporter room,Spock,,They are inseparably close to one another. We cannot transport one
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Spock,,Without the other.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Scott,,Did you say the word immediately was an exact quote of the captain's order?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Spock,,"Precisely, Mister Scott."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Scott,,"Well, are we going to do anything about it?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Spock,,"Until the High Advisor is alone or can be isolated, the captain will have to wait. Unless you have an alternative?"
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Scott,,I'll give it further thought.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Droxine,,"No, I wasn't thinking of Captain Kirk. It's the one with those exquisitely shaped ears. His name is Spock. He's the one I was thinking about. Did you know that he has the most incredibly sensitive hearing? Why, I almost believe that if I stood here and called out to him, he would hear my invitation to come and visit with us for a little while longer."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,"Oh, he's no better than his friend."

74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Scott,,The Advisor looked mighty angry. I hope he doesn't give the captain too much trouble.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,bridge,Spock,,The captain will employ his usual diplomatic balm.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Plasus,,"Abduction of a planet official is a serious crime. You will pay for this, I promise you."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Kirk,,"Not until you're convinced of the effects of the zenite gas, Mister Advisor."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Plasus,,What effects? I've been here nearly an hour of your Earth time. You and Vanna even longer. I see no changes in any of us!
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Kirk,,Perhaps you need closer exposure. Fill that container.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Plasus,,Are you suggesting that I dig zenite?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Kirk,,I insist.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,mine,Plasus,,You will indeed pay for this.

74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Spock,,"It is less technical, therefore less accurate, but perhaps more generally descriptive of the function."
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,It appears you have what you came for after all.

74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,Agreed? There's no such word in the Troglyte vocabulary.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Vanna,,The captain will have his zenite.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,No thanks to any agreement by you. It had to be obtained by force.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Vanna,,Because it is the only way we can obtain what is due us.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,How about your education? Was that by force?
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Vanna,,It served your purpose at the time.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,You could have had those filters for all the good it will do you.

74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Droxine,,Someday I should like to visit it.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Kirk,,Perhaps some form of mediation can be helpful in your difficulties. The Federation Bureau of Industrialisation may be of aid to you.
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Plasus,,I will tolerate absolutely no interference! You will not set foot here as long as I rule!
74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Kirk,,"Believe me, sir, I have neither the time nor the desire to return here. Only answering your charges against me will force me back."

74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Kirk,,You're guilty of attacking a starship commander and plotting against his life.

74,3,The Cloud Minders,council gallery,Kirk,,"Yes, Vanna. They never happened. Mister Advisor? (Plasus nods) Mister Spock, let's get that zenite delivered. I believe we only have three hours left."

75,3,The Way To Eden,transporter room,Sevrin,,The planet Eden.
75,3,The Way To Eden,transporter room,Kirk,,That planet it is a myth.

75,3,The Way To Eden,transporter room,Sevrin,,We do not recognise Federation regulations nor the existence of hostilities. We recognise no authority save that within ourselves.
75,3,The Way To Eden,transporter room,Kirk,,"Well, whether you recognise authority or not, I am it on this ship. I am under orders to transport you back to Starbase peaceably. From there you'll be ferried to your various planets. Because of my orders, you are not prisoners, but my guests. I expect you to behave as such."

75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, what is it?"
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Chekov,,"Sir, I believe I know one of them. At least, I think I recognise her voice. Her name is Irina Galliulin. We were in Starfleet Academy together."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,One of those was in the Academy?

75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, do they really believe that Eden exists?"
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Spock,,"Many myths are based on truth, Captain, and they are not unintelligent. Their leader, Doctor Sevrin, is a man"
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,Doctor Sevrin is their leader?
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Spock,,"Yes. A brilliant research engineer in the fields of acoustics, communications and electronics on Tiburon. He was dismissed from his post when he started this movement. Tong Rad inherits his father's extraordinary abilities in the field of space studies."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,Well. But they've rejected all that and all that this technology provides. And they seek the primitive.
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Spock,,"There are many who are uncomfortable with what we have created. It is almost a biological rebellion. A profound revulsion against the planned communities, the programming, the sterilised, artfully balanced atmospheres. They hunger for an Eden where spring comes."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,All do. The cave is deep in our memory.
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Spock,,"Yes, that is true, Captain."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,But we don't steal space cruisers and act like irresponsible children. KIRK: What makes you so sympathetic toward them?
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Spock,,"It is not sympathy so much as curiosity, Captain. A wish to understand. They regard themselves as aliens in their own worlds, a condition with which I am somewhat familiar."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,Spock. What does Herbert mean?
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Spock,,"It is somewhat uncomplimentary, Captain. Herbert was a minor official notorious for his rigid and limited patterns of thought."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,"Well, I shall try to be less rigid in my thinking."

75,3,The Way To Eden,corridor,Irina,,"Look at yourself, Pavel."
75,3,The Way To Eden,corridor,Chekov,,Why did you do it?
75,3,The Way To Eden,corridor,Irina,,Why did you?
75,3,The Way To Eden,corridor,Chekov,,I am proud of what I am. I believe in what I do. Can you say that?
75,3,The Way To Eden,corridor,Irina,,"Yes. Oh, we should not tear at each other so, Pavel. We should meet again in joy. Today when I first knew it was your ship that followed us, I thought of you and wondered what I would find. And I remembered so much. In spite of that uniform, I still see the same Pavel I used to know."
75,3,The Way To Eden,rec room,Irina,,Are you happy in what you do?
75,3,The Way To Eden,rec room,Chekov,,Yes.
75,3,The Way To Eden,rec room,Irina,,Then I accept what you do.
75,3,The Way To Eden,rec room,Chekov,,You even talk like them. Why did you go away?
75,3,The Way To Eden,rec room,Irina,,It was you who went.
75,3,The Way To Eden,rec room,Chekov,,I came back to look for you. I looked. Where did you go?
75,3,The Way To Eden,rec room,Irina,,"I stayed in the city, with friends."
75,3,The Way To Eden,rec room,Chekov,,You never felt as I did. Never.
75,3,The Way To Eden,rec room,Irina,,I did.
75,3,The Way To Eden,rec room,Chekov,,"You don't have it in you to feel so much. Even when we were close, you weren't with me. You were off thinking of something else. Why did you stay away?"
75,3,The Way To Eden,rec room,Irina,,"Because you disapproved of me, Just as you do now. Oh, Pavel, you have always been like this. So correct. And inside, the struggle not to be. Give in to yourself. You will be happier. You'll see."

75,3,The Way To Eden,sickbay,Kirk,,"What's going on, Bones?"
75,3,The Way To Eden,sickbay,Mccoy,,Trouble. Your friend here didn't want a checkup. Turns out there's a reason.

75,3,The Way To Eden,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I wish it were. There's a nasty little bug evolved in the last few years, Jim. Our aseptic, sterilised civilisations produced it. Synthococcus novae. It's deadly. We can immunise against it, but haven't learned to lick all the problems yet."
75,3,The Way To Eden,sickbay,Kirk,,Does he have it? What about the others?
75,3,The Way To Eden,sickbay,Mccoy,,"All the others are clear. He doesn't have it. He's a carrier. Remember your ancient history? Typhoid Mary? He's immune, as she was, but he carries the disease and spreads it to others."
75,3,The Way To Eden,sickbay,Kirk,,Is the crew in danger?
75,3,The Way To Eden,sickbay,Mccoy,,"I don't know. They all had full spectrum immunisations before boarding. Now my guess is that his friends have had their shots too. But a regular programme of shots is necessary. I'll have to check everyone on the ship. There could be some skips. In the meantime, he should be placed in total isolation."
75,3,The Way To Eden,sickbay,Sevrin,,"This is outrageous. You're not isolating me, you're imprisoning me. You invent a crime, find me guilty and sentence me!"
75,3,The Way To Eden,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Would you like to run the test, Doctor? You knew you were a carrier before you came aboard, didn't you?"
75,3,The Way To Eden,sickbay,Sevrin,,No!
75,3,The Way To Eden,sickbay,Mccoy,,Then why did you fight the examination?
75,3,The Way To Eden,sickbay,Sevrin,,It was an infringement on my rights.

75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Scott,,"Captain, I just had to give one of those barefooted what do you call 'ems the boot out of here. She came in bold as brass, tried to incite my crew to disaffect."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,"Thank you, Scotty. Mister Spock, I don't seem to be able to communicate with these people. Do you think you can persuade them to behave?"
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Spock,,"I shall make an attempt, Captain."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,"Thank you, Mister Spock. If it weren't for that ambassador's son, they'd all be in the brig."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Spock,,"Yes, sir."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 5832.5. The arrogance of Doctor Sevrin and his followers is creating an intolerable situation aboard the Enterprise. If it continues, I'll be forced to use controls which might not agree with Starfleet's suggestion that they be handled with extreme tolerance."
75,3,The Way To Eden,brig,Sevrin,,I have no influence over what they do.
75,3,The Way To Eden,brig,Spock,,"They respect you. They will listen to your reasoning. For their sake, you must stop them. Doctor Sevrin, I'm in a position to help you and your group. I can use the resources of the Enterprise to determine whether or not Eden actually exists and to plot its exact location. I can present a case to Federation to allow you and your group to colonise that planet. Neither you nor your people are at present charged with a crime. However, incitement to disaffection is criminal. The Federation will never allow the colonisation of a planet by criminals. If they persist, they will be so charged and forever barred from Eden."
75,3,The Way To Eden,brig,Sevrin,,As I have been barred.
75,3,The Way To Eden,brig,Spock,,Then you knew you were a carrier.
75,3,The Way To Eden,brig,Sevrin,,Of course I knew. You've researched my life. You've read the orders restricting me to travel only in areas of advanced technology because of what my body carries.
75,3,The Way To Eden,brig,Spock,,What I fail to understand is why you disobey those orders.
75,3,The Way To Eden,brig,Sevrin,,"Because this is poison to me. This stuff you breathe, this stuff you live in, the shields of artificial atmosphere that we have layered about every planet. The programs in those computers that run your ship and your lives for you, they bred what my body carries. That's what your science have done to me. You've infected me. Only the primitives can cleanse me. I cannot purge myself until I am among them. Only their way of living is right. I must go to them."
75,3,The Way To Eden,brig,Spock,,Your very presence will destroy the people you seek. Surely you know that.
75,3,The Way To Eden,brig,Sevrin,,"I shall go to them and be One with them. And together we shall build a world such as this galaxy has never seen. A world. A life. A life. So now you're going to try to persuade me that your technologies will find a cure for me, and then I'll be free to go."
75,3,The Way To Eden,brig,Spock,,"Yes, Doctor."
75,3,The Way To Eden,brig,Sevrin,,And for that reason I should persuade my friends to behave so that they too will be allowed.

75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Spock,,"Doctor Sevrin is insane. I've not consulted Doctor McCoy, but I have no doubt of it."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,"I'll have Bones check him out. Spock, I'm sorry. You had great respect for him. But it does explain some of what they've done."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Spock,,"His condition does not affect my interest in the movement. There is no insanity in what they seek. I made a promise which I should like to keep. With your permission, I must locate Eden. I shall work in my quarters. May I have the assistance of Mister Chekov in auxiliary control?"
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,"Certainly. Mister Chekov, assist Mister Spock. Bridge to Sickbay."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Mccoy,,McCoy here.
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,Bones.
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Mccoy,,"Yes, Captain."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,I'd like to talk to you.
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 5832.6. I have asked Doctor McCoy to check Starfleet medical records to verify Mister Spock's suspicion that Doctor Sevrin is insane. In spite of Doctor Sevrin's antipathy to us, he has promised Mister Spock that he will order his disciples to conform to our rules and regulations."
75,3,The Way To Eden,spock's quarters,Spock,,Come in.
75,3,The Way To Eden,spock's quarters,Adam,,Am I crossing you?
75,3,The Way To Eden,spock's quarters,Spock,,No.
75,3,The Way To Eden,spock's quarters,Adam,,"I was just thinking, I (sees the lyre) Hey, brother, do you play? Is it Vulcan? Can I try it?"
75,3,The Way To Eden,spock's quarters,,Spock gestures his permission and the young man strums a chord,
75,3,The Way To Eden,spock's quarters,Adam,,"Oh ho, that's now. That's real now. I reach that, brother. I really do. Give."
75,3,The Way To Eden,spock's quarters,,He hands the lyre to Spock who plays it briefly,
75,3,The Way To Eden,spock's quarters,Adam,,"Hey, how about a session, you and us? It would sound. That's what I came for. I wanted to ask, you know, great white captain upstairs, but he don't reach us. But would he shake on a session? I mean, we want to co-operate, like you ask, so I'm asking."
75,3,The Way To Eden,spock's quarters,Spock,,"If I understand you correctly, I believe the answer might be yes."
75,3,The Way To Eden,spock's quarters,Adam,,I'll spread the word.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Irina,,Am I allowed in?
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Chekov,,Yes.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Irina,,"I have been looking for you, Pavel. What room is this?"
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Chekov,,Auxiliary control.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Irina,,What's it for?
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Chekov,,"Should the main control room breakdown or suffer damage, we can navigate the ship from here. What do you want?"
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Irina,,To apologise. I should not have teased you. It was cruel.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Chekov,,It does not matter.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Irina,,"Oh, but it does. It is against everything I believe in."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Chekov,,Let us not discuss your beliefs.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Irina,,"And I do not like having you angry with me, or disapproving."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Chekov,,Then why do you do such things?
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Irina,,What are you working on?
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Chekov,,I am assisting Mister Spock in locating your Eden.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Irina,,"Oh, now you are teasing me."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Chekov,,"I am not. These tapes contain star charts, and we project the orbits of the various planets here. By mathematical process, we determine whether or not they are affected by other bodies not yet charted."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Irina,,Do you know all these things?
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Chekov,,"What I do not know I find out from the computer banks. If, if I knew nothing at all, I could navigate the ship simply by studying what is stored in there. They contain the sum of all human knowledge. They solve our problems of navigation. Of control. Of life support."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Irina,,"They tell you what to do, and you do what they tell you."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Chekov,,No. We use our own judgment also.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Irina,,I could never obey a computer.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Chekov,,You could never listen to anyone. You always had to be different.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Irina,,Not different. What I wanted to be. There is nothing wrong in doing what you want.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,,"Chekov gives in, and kisses her",
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Spock,,"I am not receiving, Mister Chekov. Spock to Chekov. Repeat, I am not receiving."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Chekov,,"I am sorry, Mister Spock. I was momentarily delayed."
75,3,The Way To Eden,guest quarters,Rad,,"His name is Sulu, specialist in weapons and navigation. His hobby is botany."
75,3,The Way To Eden,guest quarters,Adam,,Can?
75,3,The Way To Eden,guest quarters,Rad,,Can. I reach botany. It's my favorite of studies. What's yours?
75,3,The Way To Eden,guest quarters,Adam,,Vulcan. Spock is practically One now.
75,3,The Way To Eden,guest quarters,Irina,,Everything can be handled from auxiliary control. The computers contain all the information we need. We can do it.
75,3,The Way To Eden,guest quarters,Adam,,It starts to chime.
75,3,The Way To Eden,guest quarters,Rad,,When will it?
75,3,The Way To Eden,guest quarters,Adam,,"Soon. Like he said now, we should all go out and swing as many as possible over."
75,3,The Way To Eden,guest quarters,Rad,,Can you suggest any special ways to swing them?
75,3,The Way To Eden,guest quarters,Adam,,Just be friendly. You know how to be friendly. Then they'll be friendly.
75,3,The Way To Eden,rec room,,Sounds are being laid down in a session and piped through the ship,
75,3,The Way To Eden,rec room,Adam,singing,"I'm talkin ''bout you, I'm talkin ''bout me. Long time back when the galaxy was new. Man found out what he had to do. Found he had to eat and he found he had to drink. And a long time later he found he had to think. Uh huh. Yes, think. I'm standing here wondering."
75,3,The Way To Eden,rec room,All,,What?
75,3,The Way To Eden,rec room,Adam,,"If a man tells another man out of my way. He piles up trouble for himself all day. But all kinds of trouble come to an end. When a man tells another man be my friend, uh huh. My friend. Well, what's it going to be?"
75,3,The Way To Eden,rec room,Girl,singing,There's a mile wide emptiness between you and me.
75,3,The Way To Eden,rec room,,Spock arrives with his lyre,

I see you. I see you. Let's get together and have some fun. I don't know how to do it but it's got to be done."

75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,,Many of the crew are moving to the beat,
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Scott,,At least we know where they are and what they're doing. I don't know why a young mind has to be an undisciplined one. They're troublemakers.
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,"I used to get into a little trouble when I was that age, Scotty. Didn't you?"
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,,"Rad takes out the man on duty in Auxiliary control, then he and Sevrin sit down and start changing things",
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, I get no response from controls. We're going off course."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Scott,,"It's shorted. No, it's channeled over somewhere. To auxiliary control."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,Bridge to auxiliary control. Bridge to auxiliary control.
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, it seems as though someone else is running the ship."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Sevrin,,"That's right, someone else is running this ship."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,,All his followers are there now,
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Sevrin,,"I am. All functions, life support as well. You cannot interfere, as I have frozen the doors to the control room."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Sevrin,,I do not intend to hand over the helm to you until and unless we reach Eden.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Sevrin,,"If I am in any way prevented from reaching that destination, I shall destroy this ship and all aboard."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,Can he do it?
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Spock,,"He has the capability, Captain."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Scott,,He's got everything channelled over.
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,Start a trace-back of all circuits.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Kirk,,See if you can bypass him.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Sevrin,,"Do that, and I shall retaliate."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Sevrin,,I shall not warn you again.
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Sulu,,"Captain, we're now leaving the Neutral Zone. Bearing into Romulan space!"
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,Any patrols?
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Spock,,Negative.
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,There will be soon. Doctor Sevrin. You are violating Romulan space and endangering the peace of the galaxy.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Kirk,,The Romulans will view this as a military intrusion and attack. Bring the ship about now. If you bring her about
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,"And return to Starbase, no charges will be leveled."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Adam,,"Like you said, Brother Sevrin."

75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Kirk,,You are being used by him.
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,"Spock, you tell them."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Spock,,"Adam, there is a file on Doctor Sevrin in our computer banks. In it you'll find a report attesting to the fact"
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Spock,,That he is a carrier of a bacillus strain known as Synthococcus novae.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Adam,sarcastic,Ain't that just awful.

75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Adam,,"Yay, brother."
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Spock,,Adam. You know I reach you. I believe in what you seek. But there is a tragic difference between what you want and what he wants.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Adam,,You're making me cry.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Rad,,"There it is. They've established Eden, Brother Sevrin."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Irina,,Pavel said they would. Our original course must have been somewhat in error.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Sevrin,,When will we get there?
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Rad,,"At this speed, three hours."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Sevrin,,They'll try to persuade us to change course presently and then they'll attack.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Rad,,How do you plan to stop them? By cutting off their life support?
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Sevrin,,"I have another weapon. Take control, Brother Rad."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,,Sevrin takes the cover off a wall access point,

75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Spock,,We are within sensor range of Eden and continuing to approach.
75,3,The Way To Eden,bridge,Kirk,,"Whatever they're going to do, they're going to do now. We have no choice. Mister Spock, Mister Scott."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Adam,,When will you use that?
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Sevrin,,At the proper time. Let me know when we're in orbit.
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Rad,,"Approaching right on the dot, just as they plotted it, Brother Sevrin."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Irina,,What will that do to them? What is it?
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Sevrin,,"Well, I'm using sound against them, beyond the ultrasonic. It will stun them and allow us time to leave. We'll go in one of their shuttlecraft."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Irina,,"Sound pitched that high doesn't stun, it destroys. I remember when we read in the text that it"
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Sevrin,,"I've gone beyond those texts, Irina. It's correct for you to be concerned, but be assured also."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Rad,,"We are in orbit over Eden, Brother Sevrin. It does destroy."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Sevrin,,"We cannot allow them to come after us. It will not reach us in here. I can control it all. I have adjusted it so that it will suspend its effects after a few moments and allow us time to escape. Then, after we've gone, it will automatically reactivate. Rejoice, brethren. Soon we shall step together into Eden."
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,,A flame appears in the wall behind them,
75,3,The Way To Eden,corridor,,Scott is trying to cut into the room with a phaser. Sevrin turns on his sonic weapon and Spock is instantly stricken with pain,

75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Kirk,,Never mind. Do we have control of the ship?
75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Chekov,,"No, sir. Control is in auxiliary."

75,3,The Way To Eden,auxiliary control,Kirk,,"No. No, they tried to destroy us. Let them think they succeeded. I want the co-ordinates zeroed in so that when we beam down, we won't be visible to them. Scotty, you have the conn. If any Romulans appear, try to make them understand. I do not want to provoke combat. Mister Spock. Mister Chekov, join us in the transporter room."

76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Spock,,"Did you say your planet, sir?"
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Flint,,"My retreat from the unpleasantness of life on Earth, and the company of people."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Kirk,,"Mister Flint, I have a sick crew up there. We can't possibly reach another planet in time. You can't refuse us the ryetalyn."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Flint,,"You're trespassing, Captain."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Kirk,,"We're in need! We'll pay for it, work for it, trade for it."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Flint,,You have nothing I want.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Kirk,,"But you have the ryetalyn that we need! If necessary, we'll take it."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Flint,,"If you do not leave voluntarily, I have the power to force you to leave or kill you where you stand."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Kirk,,"Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott, lock phasers onto our co-ordinates."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Scott,,"Aye, Captain, all phasers locked on."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Kirk,,"Mister Flint, if anything happens to us, four deaths and then my crew comes down and takes that ryetalyn."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Flint,,An interesting test of power. Your enormous forces against mine. Who would win?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Spock,,"Mister Flint, unless you are certain, I would suggest you refrain from a most useless experiment."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Kirk,,We need only a few hours.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Mccoy,,Have you ever seen a victim of Rigelian fever? They die in one day. The effects are like bubonic plague.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Flint,,"Constantinople, summer 1334. It marched through the streets, the sewers. It left the city by ox cart, by sea, to kill half of Europe. The rats, rustling and squealing in the night as they, too, died. The rats."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Spock,,"Are you a student of history, sir?"
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Flint,,"I am. The Enterprise, a plague ship. You have two hours, at the end of which time you will leave."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Kirk,,With all due gratitude.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,planet surface,Flint,,M4 will gather the ryetalyn which you need. (the device leaves) Permit me to offer you more comfortable surroundings.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,"A comfortable room, with 18th century furniture, woven rugs, paintings on the wall",
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,"Come in, gentlemen."

76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,"My planet is surrounded by screens which create the impression of lifelessness. A protection against the curious, the uninvited."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,Then you live here alone.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,"Except for M4, which serves as butler, housekeeper, gardener and guardian."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,"A most impressive home, Mister Flint."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,"Yes, a Shakespeare first folio. A Gutenberg Bible."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,,"A young woman sits in a high-backed carved chair, watching a monitor image of Kirk",
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Mccoy,,"The Creation lithographs by Taranullus of Centauri Seven. That's one of the rarest book collections in the galaxy, spanning centuries."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Flint,,"Be comfortable, gentlemen. Help yourselves to brandy."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,Do we trust him?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,It would seem logical to do so for the moment.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,"Well, I'll need two hours to process that ryetalyn into antitoxin."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,"If that ryetalyn isn't here in one hour, we'll go prospecting, right over Mister Flint if necessary."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,"This is the most splendid private collection of art I've ever seen, and the most unique. The majority are the works of Leonardo da Vinci, Renaissance period, some of the works of Reginald Pollack, 20th century, and even a sten from Marcus Two."

76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Flint,,Other men.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Rayna,,One is not human.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Flint,,The Vulcan.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Rayna,,"Oh, so that is a Vulcan. I would like to discuss sub-dimensional physics with him. You've taught me all you know in the area and you say Vulcans know more."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Flint,,"Even he is not your intellectual equal, nor mine."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Rayna,,Let me meet them.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Flint,,"They are selfish, brutal, a part of the human community which I rejected and from which I've shielded you."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Rayna,,Soon they will be gone. Let me meet them.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Flint,,Rayna. (nearly kisses her) Have you been lonely?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Rayna,,What is loneliness?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Flint,,It is thirst. It is a flower dying in the desert.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Rayna,,"Flint, don't take this opportunity away from me. It's so exciting."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Flint,,Exciting? You have never made a demand of me before.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Rayna,,I'm sorry.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Flint,,Do not be sorry. It might be interesting.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,"Saurian brandy, one hundred years old. Jim?"
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,Please.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,"Mister Spock, I know you won't have one. Heaven forbid those mathematically perfect brain waves be corrupted by this all too human vice."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,"Thank you, Doctor. I will have a brandy."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,Do you think the two of us can handle a drunk Vulcan? Once alcohol hits that green blood
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,"If I appear distracted, it is because of what I have seen. I am close to experiencing an unaccustomed emotion."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,I'll drink to that. What emotion?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,"Envy. None of these da Vinci paintings has ever been catalogued or reproduced. They are unknown works, all apparently authentic to the last brush stroke and use of materials. As undiscovered da Vinci's, they would be priceless."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,Would be? You mean you think they're fakes?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,Most strange. A man of Flint's obvious wealth and impeccable taste scarcely needs to hang fakes. Yet my tricorder analysis indicates that the canvas and pigments used are of contemporary origin.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,"Well, this could be what it seems to be, or it could be a cover, a setup, or even an illusion."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,"Well, that could explain the paintings. Similar to the real thing."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,"Spock, at your earliest opportunity, take a full tricorder reading of our host. See if he's human. Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott?"
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Scott,,"Aye, Captain."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,"Mister Scott, run a full computer check on Mister Flint and on this planet, Holberg Nine One Seven G. Stand by with your results. I'll contact."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Scott,,"Aye, sir."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,Kirk out. Let's enjoy this brandy. It tastes real.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,M4 glides in with a bag of purple crystals and puts it on the table. It leaves,
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,Easy. Bones?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,"Ryetalyn, ready to be processed into antitoxin."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,Beam up to the ship and start processing.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,"That will not be necessary, Captain. M4 can prepare the ryetalyn for inoculation more quickly in my laboratory than you could aboard your ship."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,"I would like to supervise that, of course."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,"And when you are satisfied as to procedures, I hope you will do me the honour of being my guests at dinner."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,"Thank you, Mister Flint. I don't think we have the time."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,I regret my earlier inhospitality. Let me make amends.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,"Rayna enters, and that thud you hear is Kirk's jaw hitting the floor",
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,"Gentlemen, may I present Rayna."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,I thought you lived alone.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,I meant there are no others besides my family. Doctor McCoy. Mister Spock.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Rayna,,"Mister Spock, I do hope we can find a moment to discuss field density and its relationship to gravity phenomena."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,Indeed. I would appreciate such a talk. It is an interest of mine.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,Captain Kirk.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Rayna,,Captain Kirk.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,Rayna.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,"Her parents were killed in an accident while in my employ. Before dying, they placed their infant, Rayna Kapec, in my custody. I have raised and educated her."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,"With most impressive results, sir. What else interests you besides gravity phenomena, Rayna?"
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Rayna,,Everything. Less than that is betrayal of the intellect.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,The totality of the universe? All knowledge?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,"Rayna possesses the equivalent of seventeen university degrees in the sciences and arts. She is aware that the intellect is not all. But its cultivation must come first or the individual makes errors, wastes time in unprofitable pursuits."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,"At her age, I rather enjoyed errors with no noticeable damage, but I must admit you're the farthest thing from a bookworm I've ever seen."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Rayna,,Flint is my teacher. You are the only other men I've ever seen.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,"The misfortune of men everywhere, and our privilege."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,"If you would accompany my robot to the laboratory, Doctor, you can rest assured that the ryetalyn is being processed."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,"Thank you, sir."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,McCoy and M4 leave,
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,"Your pleasure, gentlemen. Chess, billiards, conversation?"
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,Why not all three?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,"M4 leads McCoy into a lab, then disappears through a door. McCoy examines the large coloured jars on a table whilst M4 works behind an opaque window",
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,Rayna sends the cue ball around all four cushions to hit both reds. Billiards,
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,Did you teach her that?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,We play often.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Rayna,,"May I show you, Captain?"
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,"You said something about savagery, Mister Flint. When was the last time you visited Earth?"
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,"You would tell me that it is no longer cruel. But it is, Captain. Look at your starship, bristling with weapons. Its mission to colonise, exploit, destroy, if necessary, to advance Federation causes."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,"Rayna guides Kirk's shot, but he misses anyway",
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,"Thank you. Our missions are peaceful, our weapons defensive. If we were barbarians, we would not have asked for ryetalyn. Indeed, your greeting, not ours, lacked a certain benevolence."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,The result of pressures which are not your concern.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,"Yes, well, those pressures are everywhere in everyone, urging him to what you call savagery. The private hells, the inner needs and mysteries, the beast of instinct. As human beings, that is the way it is. To be human is to be complex. You can't avoid a little ugliness from within and from without."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,"While Rayna is very close to Kirk, Spock is at a gold carved grand piano",
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,"Why don't you play the waltz, Mister Spock? To be human is also to seek pleasure, to laugh, to dance. Rayna is a most accomplished dancer."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,May I have the pleasure?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,So the couple do an old-fashioned waltz as Spock plays,
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,"In the lab, M4 brings three vials to McCoy for analysis",
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,Kirk and Rayna are now literally cheek to cheek. Flint is watching her carefully,
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,McCoy enters,
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,Is something wrong?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,"Yes, there's something wrong. The ryetalyn is no good. It contains irillium, nearly one part per thousand."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,Irillium will render the antitoxin inert and useless.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,"Most unfortunate that it was not detected. I shall go with M4 to gather more ryetalyn and screen it myself. You're welcome to join me, Doctor."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,Thank you.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,Flint leaves,
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,"Time factor, Bones? Epidemic?"
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,Nearly two and a half hours. I guess we've got time to get in under the wire. I've never seen anything like the speed of that robot. It'd take us twice as long to process that stuff.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,But would we have made the error?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,"Jim, what if all the ryetalyn on this planet contains irillium?"
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,Go with Flint. Keep an eye on procedures.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Mccoy,,Like a hawk.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,McCoy leaves,
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,Captain. Something else which is rather extraordinary. This waltz I just played is by Johannes Brahms.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,"Later, Spock."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,"Captain, it is written in manuscript. In original manuscript, in Brahms' own hand, which I recognise. It is totally unknown, definitely the work of Brahms, and yet unknown."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,I think I will go to the laboratory. There may be a way of reversing the irillium's effect and saving the existing antitoxin. Stay here. Let me know when Flint and McCoy return.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 5843.75. Have I committed a grave error in accepting Flint's word that he would deliver the antidote to us? The precious time I have let pass may result in disaster for the Enterprise and her crew."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,,Kirk is having a look around when Rayna enters and goes to a closed door,
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Kirk,,You left us. The room became lonely.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Rayna,,"It is a thirst, a flower dying in the desert."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Kirk,,What? What's in there?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Rayna,,I do not know. Flint told me never to enter. He denies me nothing else.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Kirk,,Then why are you here?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Rayna,,"I do not know. I come here when I am troubled, when I would search myself."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Kirk,,Are you troubled now?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Rayna,,Yes.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Kirk,,By what? Are you happy here with Flint?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Rayna,,"He is the greatest, kindest, wisest man in the galaxy."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Kirk,,Then why are you afraid? (he embraces her) Don't be afraid.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,,Kirk kisses Rayna. M4 enters and Rayna is scared. Kirk pushes her away,
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Rayna,,Stop command. Stop.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,,M4 ignores her and pursues Kirk around the room. Spock vapourises it with his phaser as it starts to fire at Kirk,
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Kirk,,"Thank you, Mister Spock."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Spock,,"Fortunately, the robot did not detect my presence and deactivate my phaser."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,M4 was programmed to defend this household and its members. No doubt I should have altered its instructions to allow for unauthorised but predictable actions on your part. It thought you were attacking Rayna. A misinterpretation.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,"If it were around right now, it would correct"
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,M4 enters,
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,"Too useful a device to be without, really. I created another. It will now go to the laboratory and join Doctor McCoy."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,M4 leaves,
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,Fascinating.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,"Be thankful that you did not attack me, Captain. I might have accepted battle, and I have twice your physical strength."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,"In your own words, it would be an interesting test of power."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,"How childish he is, Rayna. Would you call him brave or a fool?"
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Rayna,,I'm glad he did not die.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Flint,,"Of course! Death, when unnecessary, is a tragic thing. Doctor McCoy's in the laboratory with the new ryetalyn. He's satisfied as to its quality. May I suggest that you wait here patiently, safely. You have seen that my defence systems operate automatically and not always in accordance with my wishes. Come, Rayna. Rayna! Come."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,"Rayna reluctantly tears herself away from Kirk, and they both leave",
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,I don't like the way he orders her around.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,"Since we are dependent on Mister Flint for the ryetalyn, Captain, may I respectfully suggest that you pay less attention to the young lady if you should encounter her again. Our host's interests do not appear to be confined to art and science."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,He loves her?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,Strongly indicated.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,"Jealousy. Yes, that would explain the attack, but he seemed to want us together. The billiard game. He suggested we dance."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,It does appear to defy the male logic as I understand it.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise. Mister Scott.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Scott,,"Aye, Captain."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,Report on the Rigelian fever.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,bridge,Scott,,"Nearly everybody aboard has got it, Captain. We're working a skeleton crew and waiting for the ryetalyn."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,bridge,Kirk,,"Just a little while longer, Scotty. Report on the computer search."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,bridge,Uhura,,There is no report on Mister Flint. He doesn't seem to have any past.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Uhura,,"The planet was purchased thirty years ago by a Mister Brack, a wealthy financier and recluse."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,"Run a computer check on Rayna Kapec. Status, legal ward after the death of her parents."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Uhura,,"Aye, sir."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,"Kirk out, Mister Scott."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,"We have still a greater mystery, Captain. I was able to run a tricorder scan on Mister Flint. He is human, but there are certain biophysical peculiarities. Some body function readings are disproportionate. For one thing, extreme age is indicated on the order of six thousand years."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,"Can you confirm that, Mister Spock?"
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,I shall programme the readings through Doctor McCoy's medical computer when we return to the ship.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,Time factor.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,We must commence ryetalyn injections within two hours and eighteen minutes or the epidemic will prove fatal to us all.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,What's keeping the processing this time?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Spock,,The delay may be deliberate.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Kirk,,As though he's keeping us here for some reason.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Spock,,"Most interesting. Our host appears to wish us to linger, yet he is apprehensive. It is logical to assume that we are being monitored and that he is aware of our every move."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,,Flint turns off the screen,
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Rayna,,You sent the robot to kill him.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Flint,,It came to protect you.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Rayna,,My mind could not have summoned it. I was not frightened.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Flint,,"It was defective, then. I would have destroyed it myself. Have I lied to you?"
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Rayna,,Never.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Flint,,Believe what I say. I would not want Captain Kirk dead. What did you feel?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Rayna,,You will let them have the ryetalyn?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Flint,,"Yes. Go to them, if you wish. Say your farewells."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,Kirk here.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Scott,,"Mister Scott, sir. There's no record of a Rayna Kapec in Federation legal banks."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,No award of custody?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,bridge,Scott,,No background at all in any computer banks. Like Flint.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,Kirk out. Like Flint. People without a past. What hold does he have over her?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Spock,,"Captain, I would suggest that our immediate concern is the ryetalyn."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,Let's find McCoy.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Rayna,,Captain?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,I'll meet you in the lab.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,Spock leaves,
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Rayna,,I've come to say goodbye.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,I don't want to say goodbye.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,,"Flint watches on the monitor as Kirk kisses Rayna, and she starts to respond",
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,sitting room,Flint,,"A last tender encounter, Captain Kirk, to end your usefulness."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Mccoy,,"I tell you, Spock, I was waiting for the robot to finish the processing, and the next thing I knew it was gone and so was the ryetalyn."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Spock,,"Interesting. Obviously, Mister Flint is not yet ready for us to depart."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Mccoy,,"Well, I think we'd better tell Jim."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Spock,,The captain wanted us to wait here.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,Come with me. I offer you happiness.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Rayna,,I've known security here.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,Kirk,,"Childhood must end. You love me, not Flint."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,living room,,Rayna dashes out of the room,
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,,Kirk enters,
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Mccoy,,Flint lied. The ryetalyn isn't here.

76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,laboratory,Spock,,"Captain, I shall get the ryetalyn."

But we have also discovered our benefactor's secret. He has created the perfect woman. Her only flaw, she's not human."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Mccoy,,"Physically human but not human. These are earlier versions of Rayna, Jim. She's an android."

76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Spock,,"Your collection of Leonardo da Vinci masterpieces, Mister Flint, they appear to have been recently painted on contemporary canvas with contemporary materials. And on your piano, a waltz by Johannes Brahms, an unknown work in manuscript, written in modern ink. Yet absolutely authentic, as are your paintings."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Flint,,I am Brahms.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Spock,,And da Vinci?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Flint,,Yes.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Spock,,How many other names shall we call you?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Flint,,"Solomon, Alexander, Lazarus, Methuselah, Merlin, Abramson. A hundred other names you do not know."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Spock,,You were born?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Flint,,"In that region of earth later called Mesopotamia, in the year 3834 BC, as the millennia are reckoned. I was Akharin, a soldier, a bully and a fool. I fell in battle, pierced to the heart and did not die."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Mccoy,,Instant tissue regeneration coupled with some perfect form of biological renewal. You learned that you were immortal and
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Flint,,"And to conceal it. To live some portion of a life, to pretend to age and then move on before my nature was suspected."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Spock,,Your wealth and your intellect are the product of centuries of acquisition. You knew the greatest minds in history.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Flint,,"Galileo, Socrates, Moses. I have married a hundred times, Captain. Selected, loved, cherished. Caressed a smoothness, inhaled a brief fragrance. Then age, death, the taste of dust. Do you understand?"
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Spock,,"You wanted a perfect, ultimate woman, as brilliant, as immortal as yourself. Your mate for all time."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Flint,,Designed by my heart. I could not love her more.

76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Kirk,,You'd wipe out four hundred lives? Why?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Flint,,"I have seen a hundred billion fall. I know death better than any man. I have tossed enemies into his grasp. And I know mercy. Your crew is not dead, but suspended."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Kirk,,Worse than dead! Restore them. Restore my ship!
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Flint,,"In time. A thousand, two thousand years. You will know the future, Captain Kirk."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Mccoy,,"You have been such men. You've known and created such beauty. You've watched your race evolve from cruelty and barbarism throughout your enormous life, and yet now you would do this to us?"
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Flint,,"The flowers of my past. I hold the nettles of the present. I am Flint now, with my needs."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Kirk,,What needs?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Flint,,"Tonight I have seen something wondrous, something I've waited for, laboured for. Nothing must endanger it. At last, Rayna's emotions have stirred to life. Now they will turn to me in this solitude which I preserve."

76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,,"The model Enterprise disappears, and appears back in orbit",
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Kirk,,"That's why you delayed the processing of the ryetalyn. You realised what was happening. You kept us together, Rayna and me, because you knew I could bring her emotions alive. And now you're just going to take over."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Flint,,"I shall take what is mine when she comes to me. We are mated, Captain, alike, immortal. You must forget your feelings in this matter, which is quite impossible for you."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Kirk,,"Impossible? Impossible. From the beginning, you used me. I can't love her, but I do love her. And she loves me."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Flint,,No!

76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Kirk,,Stay out of this. We're fighting over a woman.

76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Rayna,,No. Do not order me. No one can order me!
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Kirk,,"She's human. Down to the last blood cell, she's human. Down to the last thought, hope, aspiration, emotion, she's human. The human spirit is free. You have no power of ownership. She's free to do as she wishes."

76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Flint,,No man beats me.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Kirk,,"I don't want to beat you. This is no test of power. Rayna belongs to herself and she claims the human right of choice to be as she wills, to do as she wills, to think as she wills."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Flint,,That's what I've worked for.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Kirk,,"Rayna, come with me."

76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Rayna,,I was not human. Now I love. I love.

76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Flint,,You can't die.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Kirk,,What happened?
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,lab two,Spock,,"She loved you, Captain. And you, too, Mister Flint, as a mentor, even as a father. There was not enough time for her to adjust to the awful power and contradictions of her new-found emotions. She could not bear to hurt either of you. The joys of love made her human, and the agonies of love destroyed her."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Spock.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"The epidemic is reduced and no longer a threat. The Enterprise is on course five one three mark seven, as you ordered."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"A very old and lonely man. And a young and lonely man. We put on a pretty poor show, didn't we? If only I could forget."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,kirk's quarters,,"He rests his head on his arms, on the desk. McCoy enters",
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Jim. Oh, thank heaven, sleeping at last."

76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Oh, those tricorder readings on Mister Flint are finally correlated: He's dying. You see, Flint, in leaving Earth with all of its complex fields within which he was formed, sacrificed immortality. He'll live the remainder of a normal life span, then die."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"On that day, I shall mourn. Does he know?"
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Yes, I told him myself. He intends to devote the remainder of his years and great abilities to the improvement of the human condition. And who knows what he might come up with."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,kirk's quarters,Spock,,Indeed.
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Well, I guess that's all. I can tell Jim later or you can. Considering his opponent's longevity, truly an eternal triangle. You wouldn't understand that, would you, Spock? You see, I feel sorrier for you than I do for him because you'll never know the things that love can drive a man to. The ecstasies, the miseries, the broken rules, the desperate chances, the glorious failures, the glorious victories. All of these things you'll never know simply because the word love isn't written into your book. Goodnight, Spock."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,kirk's quarters,Spock,,"Goodnight, Doctor."
76,3,Requiem For Methuselah,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,I do wish he could forget her.

77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,"Spock, any answers?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Spock,,"I still read a suggestion of carbon cycle life forms on the planet surface, Captain."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,Which is scientifically impossible under conditions there.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Spock,,"Agreed. Mister Sulu, switch to the planet area I have under observation."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Sulu,,"I'm reading it now, Mister Spock. It seems to indicate artificial power being generated in factor seven quantities."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Spock,,Which would indicate a considerable civilisation there.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Mccoy,,"What's all this poppycock about life forms on this planet, Spock? The surface is molten lava. The atmosphere is poisonous."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Spock,,"Our readings could be false, Captain, perhaps caused by some natural phenomena."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Mccoy,,Well I think Starfleet should forget about those old space legends. There's no intelligent life here.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant, anything from the planet?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Uhura,,"I've repeatedly tried on every hailing frequency, sir. There's no response on any channel."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,Transmit to Starfleet our sensor readings and log entries on the planet. Surface conditions make it impossible for us to beam down and investigate further. We are therefore going on to our next assignment.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Uhura,,"Aye, aye, sir."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Sulu,,"Completing final orbit, sir."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,Prepare to warp us out.

77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,Uhura
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Lincoln,,No need to check your voice telegraph device. Do I gather that you recognise me?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,I recognise what you appear to be.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Lincoln,,"And appearances can be most deceiving, but not in this case, James Kirk. I am Abraham Lincoln."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,Spock.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Spock,,Fascinating.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Lincoln,,"I have been described in many ways, Mister Spock, but never with that word."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,"I was requesting your analysis, Spock."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Spock,,"They did scan us and our vessel, Captain, and doubtless obtained sufficient information to present this illusion."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Lincoln,,"Illusion? Captain, will you permit me to come aboard your vessel? No doubt you have devices which can check my reality."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,"We'd be honoured to have you aboard, Mister President."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Lincoln,,Do you still measure time in minutes?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,"We can convert to it, sir."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Lincoln,,"Then you should be directly over my position in. There. Exactly twelve and one half minutes. Until then, Captain."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,,And the orange planet is back in view,
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,signing a PADD,"Thank you, Mister Mulney."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Spock,,"Small change occurring there, Captain."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,"Magnification four, helm."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, aye, sir."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Spock,,An area of approximately one thousand square kilometres. It measures completely Earth-like.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Sulu,,Perfect oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Chekov,,"He called it to the second, sir. We'll be over it in exactly twelve minutes now."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,"Security, send a detachment to the transporter room immediately, phaser side arms, and be prepared to give presidential honours."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Mccoy,,"Jim, do you really believe he's Abraham Lincoln?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,"It's obvious he believes it. Doctor McCoy, Mister Spock, full dress uniforms."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,,"Scott is in kilt and plaid, the three security guards look smart",
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Scott,,"Full dress? Presidential honours? What is this nonsense, Mister Dickerson?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Dickerson,,"I understand President Lincoln's coming aboard, sir."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Scott,,"Ha! You're daft, man."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Dickerson,,"All I know is what the captain tells me, and he says he'll have the hide of the first man that so much as smiles."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,,McCoy enters,
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Scott,,"I'd have expected sanity from the ship's surgeon, at least. President Lincoln, indeed. No doubt to be followed by Louis of France and Robert the Bruce."

77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Kirk,,"If so, we'll execute appropriate honours to each, Mister Scott."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Scott,,"Aye, sir."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Kirk,,"Gentlemen, I don't for a moment believe that President Lincoln is actually coming aboard, but we're dealing with an unknown and apparently highly advanced life-form. Until we know, when in Rome, we'll do as the Romans do."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Chekov,,Bridge to Transporter room. One minute to overhead position.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Scott,,"Locked on to something. Does that appear human to you, Mister Spock?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Spock,,"Fascinating. For a moment, it appeared almost mineral. Like living rock with heavy fore claws. It's settling down now to completely human readings."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Scott,,"We can beam it aboard anytime now, sir."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Kirk,,"Doctor McCoy, take tricorder readings and see if it is human. Appropriate ruffles and flourishes, Mister Spock. Security, stand ready."

77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Kirk,,"The USS Enterprise is honoured to have you aboard, Mister President."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Lincoln,,Strange. Where are the musicians?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Kirk,,"That's taped music, sir. A starship on active duty never carries an honour detachment."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Lincoln,,"Taped music, you say. Well, perhaps Mister Spock will be good enough to explain that to me later. A most interesting way to come aboard, Captain. What was the device used?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Kirk,,"An energy-matter scrambler, sir. The molecules in your body are converted into energy, then beamed into this chamber and reconverted back into their original pattern."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Lincoln,,"Well, since I'm obviously here, and quite whole, whatever you mean apparently works very well indeed. Gentlemen, if those are weapons, please lower them. At my age, I'm afraid I'm not very dangerous."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Mccoy,,"Human, Jim."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Lincoln,,"All too human, Doctor McCoy. Happy to make your acquaintance."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Kirk,,"Mister President, may I present my officers. Commander Spock, second in command, Engineering Officer Scott and Security Officer Dickerson."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Lincoln,,"Mister Spock, Mister Scott, Mister Dickerson. Gentlemen, I hope to talk to each of you. But meanwhile, your captain is consumed with questions and I shall do my utmost to answer them. And I trust your duties will permit time to answer some of mine. At your service, Captain."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Kirk,,"Lieutenant Dickerson, you and your men may return to quarters. Mister President."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Lincoln,,A most interesting vessel.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,,"Kirk, Lincoln, Spock and security leave",
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Mccoy,,Just what was it you locked onto before you beamed him aboard?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Scott,,"You heard Mister Spock yourself. Mineral he called it, like living rock."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Mccoy,,And that became Lincoln?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Scott,,I couldn't tell. It may have been another figure down there standing by. What do you make of it?

77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 5906.4. Who or what has been beamed aboard our vessel? An alien who has changed himself into this form? An illusion? I cannot conceive it possible that Abraham Lincoln could have actually been reincarnated. And yet his kindness, his gentle wisdom, his humour, everything about him is so right."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, if I recall, your Union Army observation balloons were tendered six hundred or so feet high. We're six hundred and forty three miles above the surface of this planet."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Lincoln,,You can measure great distances that closely?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Spock,,"We do, sir. Six hundred forty three miles, two thousand twenty one feet, two point zero four inches at this moment, using your old-style measurements."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Lincoln,,Bless me.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Uhura,,"Excuse me, Captain Kirk."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, Lieutenant."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Uhura,,Mister Scott
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Lincoln,,"What a charming negress. Oh, forgive me, my dear. I know in my time some used that term as a description of property."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Uhura,,"But why should I object to that term, sir? You see, in our century we've learned not to fear words."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,"May I present our communications officer, Lieutenant Uhura."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Lincoln,,The foolishness of my century had me apologising where no offense was given.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,We've each learned to be delighted with what we are. The Vulcans learned that centuries before we did.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Spock,,"It is basic to the Vulcan philosophy, sir. The combination of a number of things to make existence worthwhile."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Lincoln,,"Yes. Philosophy of Nome, meaning all. How did I know that? Just as I seem to know that on the planet surface you will meet one of the greatest living Vulcans in all the long history of your planet. My mind cannot recall his name, but I know he will be there. What is it that powers your vessel, Captain? May I see your engine room?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,Certainly. Our engineering officer
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Uhura,,"Has been waiting in the briefing room for you, sir, for over two hours."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,"Oh, dear. If you'll forgive me, our communications officer"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Lincoln,,I would be delighted to have her as guide.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,Forgive me again. We'll rejoin you shortly.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Mccoy,,Where the devil are they?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Scott,,"Why, they're probably looking up a plate of haggis in the galley. They've been everywhere else."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,,Kirk and Spock enter,
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Kirk,,"Sorry to have been delayed, gentlemen."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Jim, I would be the last to advise you on your command image."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Kirk,,"I doubt that, Bones, but continue."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Mccoy,,Do I have to lay it out for you? Practically the entire crew has seen you treat this impostor like the real thing when he can't possibly be the real article.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Scott,,Lincoln died three centuries ago on a planet hundreds of light years away.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Spock,,"More that direction, Engineer."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Mccoy,,"You're the science officer. Why aren't you, well, doing whatever a science officer does at a time like this?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Spock,,"I am, Doctor. I am observing the alien."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Mccoy,,At last! At least somebody agrees with us he's an alien.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Kirk,,"Yes, of course he's an alien."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Narrator,,MCCOY And he's potentially dangerous.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Scott,,Mad. Loony as an Arcturian dogbird.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Kirk,,"Gentlemen, as you know, Mister Spock and I have been invited to beam down to the planet surface with him. Any comments on that?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Yes, a big one. Suddenly, miraculously, we see a small spot of Earth-type environment down there. Now is it really there, or do we just think we see it down there?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Scott,,You might beam down into a sea of molten lava.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Kirk,,But why would he want to kill only two of us?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Spock,,"It would be illogical. With such abilities, they could as easily trick us into destroying the entire vessel."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Mccoy,,"Are you implying, Mister Spock, that it's probably safe to beam down there?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Spock,,"No, I'm not, Doctor. There's no doubt they want us down there for some hidden purpose. Otherwise, they would have revealed some logical reason for all of this."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Kirk,,"Why Lincoln, Spock? Any speculation on that?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Spock,,"Speculation is unnecessary, Captain. The answer is clear. President Lincoln has always been a very personal hero to you. What better way to titillate your curiosity than to make him come alive for you."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Kirk,,"But not only to me, Spock."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Spock,,"Agreed. I, too, experienced his charm. It is a magnificent work of duplication."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Mccoy,,"But he holds a special involvement to you, Jim. I think it's interesting, in as much as you're the one who's going to make the decision whether to beam down or not."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Scott,,"Don't do it, Captain."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Kirk,,"The very reason for the existence of our starships is contact with other life. Although the method is beyond our comprehension, we have been offered contact. Therefore, I shall beam down. Mister Spock, as for you"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Spock,,"Captain, since I was included in the invitation to make contact, I must beam down with you."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Mccoy,,You're both out of your heads!
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Scott,,"Aye, sir."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Kirk,,And you're on the edge of insubordination.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Mccoy,,Would I be on the edge of insubordination to remind the captain that this smells of something happening to him that I might not be able to patch together again?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Scott,,Aye!
77,3,The Savage Curtain,briefing room,Kirk,,"Gentlemen, your concern is noted and appreciated. Mister Spock, standard dress, tricorders and phasers. We will guide President Lincoln to the transporter room. We'll beam down immediately."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Kirk,,"Standing by, Mister Scott."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Scott,,Transporter room to bridge. Standing by.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Chekov,,"We are now locked in synchronous orbit, Mister Scott. Sensors continue to show the area as completely Earth-like in all respects."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Mccoy,,If they're wrong and they do beam into a pool of lava
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Scott,,Then they're dead men. I couldna pull them back in time.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Kirk,,"All right, Mister Scott, energise."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,,"Lincoln, Kirk and Spock are beamed away, but - ",
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Mccoy,,Scotty.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,,"Sandy ground, big rocks, orange sky",
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Spock,,Captain. Our phasers and tricorders did not beam down with us.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,"Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise? Enterprise, come in. Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Spock,,"Undamaged, yet something is preventing them from functioning."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Scott,,"Come in, landing party. Report. Enterprise to Captain Kirk. Can you read us?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,transporter room,Mccoy,,"If they're all right, they should've reported in."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,"Your explanation, sir?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Lincoln,,"Well, I have none. To me this seems quite as it should be."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,Why were our weapons taken? Why can't we communicate with our ship?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Lincoln,,"Please, believe me. I know nothing other than what I have already told you."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,The game is over. We've treated you with courtesy. We've gone along with what and who you think you are.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Lincoln,,"Despite the seeming contradictions, all is as it appears to be. I am Abraham Lincoln."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Surak,,Just as I am whom I appear to be.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Spock,,Surak.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,Who?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Spock,,"The greatest of all who ever lived on our planet, Captain. The father of all we became."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Sulu,in the captain's chair,All ship's systems going dead. Switch to reserve power. All decks report status.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Uhura,,All decks report status. All decks report status.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Sulu,,"Bridge to Engineering. Come in. What's happening to our power? Bridge to Engineering, report."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Engineer,,Everything's out. We've switched to reserve power. Lost all power in the warp engines.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,,Scott and McCoy enter,
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Scott,,"How is it, Mister Sulu?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Sulu,,No answer yet on what caused it. They're standing by.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Scott,,Shut down all but the most necessary systems.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Uhura,,"No damage report, Mister Scott."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Engineer,,"No indication of engine damage, sir."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Scott,,Engage restart cycle.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Engineer,,I can't. I don't understand it.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Scott,,Start emergency procedures.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Engineer,,"Aye, aye, sir."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Surak,,"Live long and prosper, Spock. May you also, Captain Kirk."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Spock,,"It is not logical that you are Surak. There is no fact, extrapolation of fact or theory, which would make possible."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Surak,,"Whatever I am, would it harm you to give response?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Spock,,"Live long and prosper, image of Surak, father of all we now hold true."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Surak,,"The image of Surak read in your face what is in your mind, Spock."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Spock,,"As I turned and my eyes beheld you, I displayed emotion. I beg forgiveness."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Surak,,"The cause was more than sufficient. Let us speak no further of it. In my time, we knew not of Earth men. I am pleased to see that we have differences. May we together become greater than the sum of both of us."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,"Spock, we'll not go along with these charades any longer."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,,A rock changes into a creature with heavy fore-claws,
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Rock,,"You'll have an answer soon, Captain. Our world is called Excalbia. Countless who live on that planet are watching. Before this drama unfolds, we give welcome to the ones named Kirk and Spock."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,"We know nothing of your world or your customs. What do you mean, drama about to unfold?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Rock,,"You're intelligent life form, but I'm surprised you do not perceive the honour we do you. Have we not created in this place on our planet a stage identical to your own world?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,"We perceive we were invited to come here, and we came in friendship. And you have deprived us of our instruments to examine your world, to defend ourselves, to communicate with our vessel."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Rock,,Your objection is well taken. We shall communicate with your vessel so your fellow life forms may also enjoy and profit from the play. Behold.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,,"More people arrive. A human, a Mongol, an alien woman and a Klingon",
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Rock,,"Captain, Mister Spock, some of these you may know through history. Genghis Khan, for one. And Colonel Green, who led a genocidal war early in the 21st century on Earth. Zora, who experimented with the body chemistry of subject tribes on Tiburon. Kahless the Unforgettable, the Klingon who set the pattern for his planet's tyrannies. We welcome the vessel Enterprise"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Rock,,To our solar system and to our spectacle.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Mccoy,,At least the captain and Spock are safe.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Scott,,It's a confrontation of some sort. Those are all figures out of history. Notoriously evil.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Rock,,We ask you to observe with us
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Rock,,"The confrontation of the two opposing philosophies you term good and evil. Since this is our first experiment with Earthlings, our theme is a simple one. Survival, life and death. Your philosophies are alien to us, and we wish to understand them and discover which is the stronger. We learn by observing such spectacles."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,"What do you mean, survival?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Rock,,"The word is explicit. If you and Spock survive, you return to your vessel. If you do not, your existence is ended."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Mccoy,,Can we beam the captain and Spock back up?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Scott,,We don't have the power. They'll come aboard a mass of dying flesh.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Mccoy,,"Well, can we send the phasers down?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Scott,,"There's nothing we can do, Doctor. Nothing but watch them. He's skimmed the worst ones in history to face them."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Mccoy,,"But they're not real, any more than that Lincoln or Surak. What do the sensors read?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Chekov,,As life-forms. They are living beings.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Mccoy,,Could they be aliens projecting an illusion?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Chekov,,The readings are those of humanoids.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Rock,,Why do you hesitate?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Rock,,"Do you wish further clarification? Your choice of action is unlimited, as is your choice of weapons. Should you wish to use any, you may fabricate anything you desire out of what you can find around you. Captain?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,Mister Spock and I refuse to participate.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Rock,,You will decide otherwise.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,,And changes back into a real lump of rock,
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,"Analysis, Spock. Why do they want us to fight?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Spock,,"It may be exactly as explained, Captain. Our concept of good and evil is strange to them. Perhaps they wish to determine which is strongest."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,And they'll get their answers if it kills us.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Lincoln,,"I'm afraid none of us may leave, gentlemen, until we do what it demands of us."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Green,,"Captain Kirk, may I speak with you? I quite agree with your attitude toward this charade. It's ridiculous to think that we should take part in it."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,What do you want?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Green,,"The same thing as you do, to get out of here. I have no quarrel with you any more than you have with me."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,"You're somewhat different than the way history paints you, Colonel Green."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Green,,"History tends to exaggerate. I suggest we call a halt to this at once and see if we can't find some way out of our difficulties. My associates are in full agreement with me. Captain, you were tricked into coming here, weren't you? So were we all."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,Where do you come from?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Green,,"I can't remember. Isn't that strange? My memory used to be quite remarkable. Well, wherever it was, I want to get back. So it seems to me, Captain, that we have a common cause, and our enemy is that creature."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,What do you propose?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Green,,"That we combine forces, and reason some way to overcome it."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,"You were notorious, Colonel Green, for striking at your enemies in the midst of negotiating with them."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Green,,"But that was centuries ago, Captain, and not altogether true. No, there is much I would change now if I could. Don't let prejudice and rumour sway you."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,,"Meanwhile, the other three baddies split up and start to circle around",
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Sulu,,Captain! How can we warn him?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,,"Khan throws a rock at Spock, and a fight starts until the bad guys run off",
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,Anyone hurt?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Lincoln,,"I fear my clothing is somewhat damaged, but how delightful to discover at my age that I can still wrestle."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,Mister Spock?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Spock,,"I'm all right, Captain. However, I suggest that we prepare ourselves for another attack."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,"No, I think Colonel Green is right. That rock-like thing is our enemy, not those illusions."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Lincoln,,"For an illusion, my opponent carried a considerable punch. Oh, I forgot. You consider me an illusion too."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Surak,,The captain speaks wisely. Those four are not our enemy. We should arrive together at a peaceful settlement.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Rock,,"I am disappointed. You display no interest in the honour we do you. We offer you an opportunity to become our teachers by demonstrating whether good or evil is more powerful. You find my body heat distressing, Captain? You forget the nature of this planet. I must conclude that your species requires a cause to fight for. You may now communicate with your ship."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,"Kirk to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,engineering,Scott,,"Scott to Engineering. Report, Lieutenant."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,engineering,Engineer,,"Emergency increasing, sir."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Engineer,,"Deterioration has just started, sir."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Scott,,"Give me that again, man. I cannot hear you."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Uhura,,"Mister Scott, I have the captain."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,"Scotty, do you read me?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Uhura,,"Mister Scott, I have the captain."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Scott,,"Engineering, check for radiation. Get a repair crew on it at once."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Engineer,,"We have already, sir. We can't seem to stop it."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Scott,,Is there a danger of detonation?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Engineer,,"Estimating four hours, sir."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Uhura,,"Red Alert, Captain. Mister Scott is standing by."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,What caused the red alert?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Uhura,,"I don't know yet, sir."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Scott,,Captain.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,"Scotty, beam us up fast."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Scott,,I cannot. We have a complete power failure.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Scott,,We're on emergency battery power only.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,What happened?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Scott,,"I can't explain it, sir, but the matter and antimatter are in red zone proximity."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,What caused that?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Scott,,There's no knowing and there's no stopping it either. The shielding is breaking down. I estimate four hours before it goes completely. Four hours before the ship blows up.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Rock,,"The estimate is quite correct. Your ship will blow itself to bits within four hours, Captain, unless you defeat the others before then. Is that cause enough to fight for?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,What if they defeat us?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Rock,,"To save your ship and your crew, you have to win."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Kirk,,"Scotty, inform Starfleet Command. Disengage nacelles, Jettison if possible. Mister Spock, assist them. Advise and analyse. Scotty? Scotty?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Rock,,"Your communicators no longer function, Captain. You may proceed with the spectacle."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Lincoln,,"James, the war is forced upon us. History repeats itself."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,planet surface,Narrator,,"Supplemental Log, stardate 5906.5. Engineer Scott reporting. The Enterprise is doomed to explode in two hours if Captain Kirk is defeated by the enemy on the surface of the planet. The enormous power of the Enterprise has been neutralised and we sit here watching, unable to assist."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad man base,Green,,Did you set the traps?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad man base,Kahless,,Yes.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad man base,Green,,What did you find out? What are they doing?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad man base,Kahless,,They've done nothing. They've not armed themselves nor prepared for any kind of defence. I say attack now and finish them.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad man base,Green,,With what? These? (pointed sticks)
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad man base,Kahless,,Better than what they have.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad man base,Green,,"No, it's not advantage enough. I want to make sure the odds are in our favour. Overwhelm and devastate, that's the way to get power and to hold it, and I mean to do that."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,"There's nothing immoral about fighting an illusion, Mister Spock. We play their game, fight, or lose the ship and all the crewmen aboard."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Spock,,"And if they're real, Captain?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,We'll use this as a base. It's defensible. They can't approach without being seen.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Lincoln,,"Are we fighting a defensive war, James?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,"No, we don't have time. But if things go against us, I want a place to retreat to. What I want to do now is scout them out, find their weaknesses and attack."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Lincoln,,Do you drink whiskey?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,Occasionally. Why?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Lincoln,,Because you have qualities very much like those of another man I admire greatly. General Grant.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,"Thank you. Thank you. Mister Spock, we'll need weapons. I believe the ancient Vulcans made something like a boomerang?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Spock,,"Yes, Captain."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,And slings and spears. Slings. Mister President. You used a sling as a boy.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Lincoln,,Indeed I did.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Spock,,Captain. Logic dictates that we consider another course.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,"We don't have much time, Spock."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Surak,,"In my time on Vulcan, we also faced these same alternatives. We'd suffered devastating wars which nearly destroyed our planet. Another was about to begin. We were torn. But out of our suffering some of us found the discipline to act. We sent emissaries to our opponents to propose peace. The first were killed, but others followed. Ultimately we achieved peace, which has lasted since then."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,"Circumstances were different then, Surak."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Surak,,"The face of war has never changed, Captain. Surely it is more logical to heal than kill."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,I'm afraid that kind of logic doesn't apply here.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Surak,,That is precisely why we should not fight.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,My ship is at stake.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Surak,,"I will not harm others, Captain."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Spock,,"His convictions are most profound in this matter, Captain."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,"So are mine, Spock. If I believed that there was a peaceful way out of this"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Surak,,"The risk will be mine alone. If I fail, you lose nothing. After all, I'm no warrior."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Spock,,"The captain knows that I have fought at his side before and will do so now, if need be. However, I too, am a Vulcan, bred to peace. Let him attempt it."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,You saw how treacherously they acted.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Surak,,"Oh, yes. But perhaps it's our belief in peace that is actually being tested."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,I have no authority over you. You may do as you think best.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Surak,,Thank you. May you live long and prosper.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,"The weapons, gentlemen. In case he fails."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Kahless,,Colonel!
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,,They watch Surak approach. Zora makes to throw a spear,
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Green,,"No. Let's hear what he has to say. We may find it useful. Stop there, Vulcan. State your purpose."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Surak,,I come in peace to propose peace.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Green,,Are you surrendering?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Narrator,,"SURAK I'm doing what I consider best for all of us. If you choose to regard that as surrender, I accept your definition."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Kahless,,"One of those peace lovers, Colonel."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Green,,Why are you doing this? Do you speak for the others?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Surak,,"No, I speak for myself because I abhor violence. But if you accept the solution I offer, they, too, will accept it."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Green,,"How can I be sure? I think you're trying to trick me, Vulcan. I think that while you're here talking peace, the others are preparing to attack."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Surak,,"No, Colonel. They are at their base awaiting an answer."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Green,,How can I believe that? No one talks peace unless he's ready to back it up with war.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Surak,,He talks peace if it is the only way to live.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Green,,"Then tell me, what do you have to gain if we accept?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Surak,,Nothing but the knowledge that I have done what I believe in.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Green,,"What do I get out of it? I fight for gain, Vulcan. What do I gain here?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Surak,,"Your life and the lives of the others. You said yourself, Colonel, that we have common cause to survive. Together we can. But not by warring."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Kahless,,Why don't we kill him?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Green,,No. He's our means to finish them all.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,,Kahless and Khan circle around,
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Surak,,"Colonel, surely you accept the logic of this. What is your answer?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Green,,"You're very persuasive, Vulcan. I'd like to come out of this with a whole skin. Perhaps I can convince my associates that it would be to their advantage also."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,,"Kirk, Spock and Lincoln are also sharpening sticks as spears",
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,Your Surak is a brave man.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Surak,,"Men of peace usually are, Captain. On Vulcan, he is revered as the father of our civilisation. The father image holds much meaning for us."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,"You show emotion, Spock."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Spock,,I deeply respect what he has accomplished.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,"I hope he accomplishes something here, and soon."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,,A scream rings out,
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,Surak?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Surak,,"Help me, Spock! Spock, help me!"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Green,,"Mister Spock, your friend wants you. He seems to be hurt."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Surak,,"Spock! Help me, Spock! Spock! Help me!"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Green,,You can't let him suffer.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Spock,,"They're trying to goad us into attacking, Captain. They expect us to act rashly."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,"Yes, I know that."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Surak,,"Help me, Spock!"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Spock,,He was aware of what might happen when he went.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,I should never have let him go.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Spock,,"You had no choice, Captain. You could not have stopped him."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,How can you ignore that?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Spock,,A Vulcan would not cry out so.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,"Whether he's a Vulcan or not, he's in agony."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Spock,,"I am not insensitive to it, Captain."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Surak,,"Help me, Spock!"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,But you can just listen to it and do nothing. I can't.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Spock,,"Captain, that is what they are waiting for. They're waiting for us to attempt a rescue."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,I can't just let him stay there.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Lincoln,,"Perhaps we can rescue him, Mister Spock. Now, I suggest that we do whatever they want."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,"Do what they want, sir?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Lincoln,,"Not the way they want it, however. We must first convince them that they have provoked us to recklessness. James, I do not mean to presume upon your authority. What I propose is that I circle around to their rear while you two provide a frontal assault. It should be sufficiently violent to cover whatever I do."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,And what will you do?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Lincoln,,"Why, slip into their camp and free him."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,No.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Lincoln,,"James, James. Remember, I was something of a backwoodsman. I doubt that you could do what I was bred to."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,"I can't let you risk it, Mister President."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Lincoln,,"I am no longer president. Mister Spock, any comment?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Surak,,"Help me, Spock!"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Spock,,"No, sir."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Lincoln,,"One matter further, gentlemen. We fight on their level. With trickery, brutality, finality. We match their evil. I know, James. I was reputed to be a gentle man. But I was commander in chief during the four bloodiest years of my country's history. I gave orders that sent a hundred thousand men to their death at the hands of their brothers. There is no honourable way to kill, no gentle way to destroy. There is nothing good in war except its ending. And you are fighting for the lives of your crew."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,good guy base,Kirk,,"Your campaign, Mister President."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Green,,They should be coming soon.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,,"Green and Khan see Kirk and Spock duck down behind a large rock, carrying a lot of spears",
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Green,,"Zora! Kahless! No, wait!"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,,Spock throws the first spear,
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Green,,How many do you see?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Kahless,,Two.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Green,,Zora.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,,"She goes to circle around. Khan and Kirk throw rocks at each other. Meanwhile, a very stealthy Lincoln has found Surak.",
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Lincoln,,Surak.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,,Green and Kahless arrive,
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Lincoln,,"Surak, the others have drawn them away. We will circle around. It was a worthy effort, Surak. Worthy. No need to blame yourself before its failure."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,,"But once untied, Surak is revealed to be dead.",
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Kahless,as Surak,"Help me, Spock. Help me, Spock."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Green,,Now can you cry like Lincoln?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Kahless,as Lincoln,"Help me, Kirk. Help me, Kirk!"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,,Lincoln walks towards Kirk and Spock,
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Kirk,,Mister Lincoln!
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Lincoln,,"James, stay back."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,,"Lincoln finally topples forward, a big spear in his back. Now the close fighting begins, with Green letting his 'associates' do the hard work. Zora runs off. Kirk deals with Kahless and helps Spock with Khan. The bad guys retreat. Kirk chases and catches Green who ends up falling on his own dagger.",
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Rock,,"You are the survivors. The others have run off. It would seem that evil retreats when forcibly confronted. However, you have failed to demonstrate to me any other difference between your philosophies. Your good and your evil use the same methods, achieve the same results. Do you have an explanation?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Kirk,,You established the methods and the goals.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Rock,,For you to use as you chose.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Kirk,,What did you offer the others if they won?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Rock,,What they wanted most. Power.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Kirk,,You offered me the lives of my crew.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Rock,,I perceive you have won their lives.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Kirk,,How many others have you done this to? What gives you the right to hand out life and death?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Rock,,The same right that brought you here. The need to know new things.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Kirk,,We came in peace.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Rock,,And you may go in peace.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Kirk,,Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Sulu,,"Is that you, Captain? Are you all right?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bad guy base,Kirk,,"Yes, Mister Sulu. We're all right. You may beam us aboard."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Scott, report."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Scott,,"The ship is functioning normally again, sir, and the restart cycle is in operation. You'd never know anything had been out of order. I can't fathom it."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,Mister Sulu.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Sulu,,"We should be on warp power within thirty minutes, sir."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,Good. Mister Chekov.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Chekov,,The deterioration in the shielding has stopped and is reversing itself. I have no explanation.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,"Thank you, Mister Chekov. Mister Spock, any explanation?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Spock,,"Conjecture, Captain, rather than explanation."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,Well?
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Spock,,It would seem that we were held in the power of creatures able to control matter and to rearrange molecules in whatever fashion was desired. So they were able to create images of Surak and Lincoln after scanning our minds and using their fellow creatures as source matter.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,"They seemed so real. And to me, especially Mister Lincoln. I feel I actually met Lincoln."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Spock,,"Yes, and Surak. Perhaps in a sense they were real, Captain. Since they were created out of our own thoughts, how could they be anything but what we expected them to be?"
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,It was so hard for me to see him die again. I feel I understand what Earth must have gone through to achieve final peace.
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Uhura,,"Captain Kirk, the planet has resumed its normal appearance."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Kirk,,"There's still so much of their work to be done in the galaxy, Spock. Mister Sulu, break us out of orbit and continue to our next assignment."
77,3,The Savage Curtain,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, aye, sir."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,,Narrator,,"Captain's log, Stardate 5943.7. We have calculated that Beta Niobe will go nova in approximately three and a half hours. Its only satellite, Sarpeidon, is a Class M planet, which at last report was inhabited by a civilised humanoid species. Now our instruments show that no intelligent life remains on the planet."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,,"Kirk, McCoy and Spock have beamed down",
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Spock,,"The power source we detected is in this building, Captain."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,Any sign of survivors?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Spock,,No signs of sapient life forms.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Mccoy,,How can a planet full of people just disappear?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,"If they knew that their sun was dying, it could be anything up to mass suicide."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Spock,,Reports deny that they had any space flight capability. This appears to be an archive or library of some kind.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,"Then we're certainly in the right place to find out what happened, where the inhabitants are, and if there are any left now."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Mccoy,,"Well, that's fine. Where do we start?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,May I help you? I am the librarian. May I be of assistance?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,,"A silver-haired man, called A to Z - perfect for a librarian",
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,"Perhaps you can, Mister"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"Mister Atoz. I confess that I'm a little surprised to see you. I had thought that everyone had long since gone. But the surprise is pleasant one. After all, a library serves no purpose unless someone is using it."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,You say everyone is gone? Where'd they go?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"It depended on the individual, of course. If you wish to trace a specific person, I'm sorry, but that information is confidential."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Mccoy,,"No, no particular person, just people in general. Where did they go?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"Ah, you find it difficult to choose, is that it? Yes, a wide range of alternatives is a mixed blessing, but perhaps I can help. Would you step this way, please?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,,"They walk away from Atoz, and another one steps in front of them from between a range of shelves",
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"May I help you? You may select from more than twenty thousand verism tapes, several hundred of which have only recently been added to the collection. I'm sure you'll find something here that pleases you. You, sir, what is your particular field of interest?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,What about recent history?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"Really? Oh, that's too bad. We have so little on recent history. There was no demand for it."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,"It doesn't have to be extensive, Just the answers to a few questions."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,Of course. Reference services available at the desk.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,,Where another Mr. Atoz is sitting,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,You're very late. Where have you been?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,"You're a very agile man, Mister Atoz. Just how many of you are there? We came as soon as we knew what was happening."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Spock,,"Forgive me, sir. It is my fault. I must have miscalculated. Our readings indicated that there was no one here at all."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,Of course I know. Everyone on this planet was warned of the coming nova long ago. They followed instructions and are now safe. And you had better do the same.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,Did you say they were safe?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,Absolutely. Every single one.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,Where did they go?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"Wherever they wanted to go, of course. It is strictly up to the individual's choice."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,I see. And you personally sent all these people on the planet to safety?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"Yes, yes, yes. They are all gone, except you three. Of course, I had to delegate the simple tasks to my replicas."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,"You are the real one, Mister Atoz?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,Of course. I am the real Mister Atoz.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Mccoy,,"As a matter of fact, he's quite real, Jim."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,Let us take you with us to a place of safety.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"No, thank you. I plan to join my wife and family when the time comes. Now, don't be concerned about me. Think of yourselves. I warn you most urgently. Make your escape before it's too late. The library is at your complete service. I will gladly supply you with all reference material to help you. History of the planet is available in every detail. Just choose what interests you the most. The millennium, the century, the date, the moment. The library is your key. (puts a disc in a reader) Oh! It's in the wrong file. Make your own selection, but remember, you're very late."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,We'll choose it as quick as we can. How long till nova?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Spock,,"Three hours, thirteen minutes."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,This gentleman is not
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"You, sir. I think you'll find something interesting over here."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,,He leads Kirk to his desk,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"Now, if these won't do, I can bring you another file."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,,"Atoz goes off to a machine, while Kirk puts a disc on the player and sees a town scene with horse-drawn carriages and a sedan chair. Spock goes over to Mister Atoz, leaving McCoy browsing images of a snow-covered waste",
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"Have you made your selection, sir?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Spock,,Exactly what is it that I'm expected to select?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,I'm sure I was clear. The period in which you're interested.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Spock,,I see. This is a fascinating machine. What is it?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"Ah, this is the atavachron."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Spock,,Interesting nomenclature. How does it work? May I
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"Oh, no, sir, no. I must ask you not to touch the controlling mechanism. Return and make your selection. When you have chosen, I will prepare you through the atavachron."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Spock,,"Thank you, Mister Atoz."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,,Kirk hears a woman scream from behind a doorway) KIRK: Spock. Bones,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,Wait! I haven't prepared you.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,,Kirk runs through the doorway and disappears. He appears in a street where people dressed as cavaliers are manhandling a wench,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,You must be prepared!
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,,Spock and McCoy go through the doorway,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Mccoy,,What is this place?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Spock,,"Yes, and where is the captain?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Wench,,You dirty thing. Let go of me!
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,,She gets spanked with a sword,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Man,,Vile vixen!
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,,Kirk grabs his weapon,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Man,,"Come when you are bidden, slave! (Kirk pushes him down) You need a lesson in how to use your betters. Who's your master?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Kirk,,"I'm a free man, sir."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Man 2,,"Then you want better manners, free man. Defend yourself!"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,,"So Kirk gets into a proper sword-fight, with foils, and wins. The two cavaliers run off, and the people laugh",
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Spock,,Heating this boulder may provide some temporary heat.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Mccoy,,What's wrong?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Spock,,Something's preventing my phaser from operating.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Wench,,"Oh, thank you, man. I thought I'd be limbered sure when that gull caught me cutting his purse."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Kirk,,What's that? Are you all right?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Wench,,"Oh, I took you to be an angler, but you're none of us, are ya? Well, you're a bully fine coe for all of that. What a handsome dish ya served them, the coxcombs."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Kirk,,You better come back with me to the library. You'll be safe there. Doctor McCoy can see to those bruises.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Wench,,"I'm game, love. Lead and I'll follow. Where's library?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Kirk,,It's right over there.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,,But all he sees is a blank brick wall,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Mccoy,,"Where's the captain, Spock? We were right behind him."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Wench,,"What's with you, man? Let's make off before coxcombs come with shoulder clappers."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Kirk,,No. Do you remember when you first saw me? Do you remember whether I came through some kind of door?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Wench,,"Oh, I think the rum gull must've kicked you in the head. Come on, love. I know a leech who'll ask no questions."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Kirk,,No. No. It must be here someplace.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Mccoy,,Jim!
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Mccoy,,"Jim, can you hear us?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Kirk,,Bones? Spock?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Spock,,"Captain, we hear you, but we cannot see you."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Spock,,Are you all right?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Kirk,,We must've missed each other somehow.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Spock,,Agreed.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Spock,,Apparently they've all escaped the destruction of their world by retreating into its past.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Wench,,Mercy on us. It's spirits.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Kirk,,"No, no. No, no, no. These are friends of mine, and they're"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Kirk,,"Spock, are you in the library?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Spock,,Indeed not. We're in a wilderness of arctic characteristics.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Mccoy,,He means it's cold.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Kirk,,Can you get to the library?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Spock,,"There is no library, Captain, at least not that we can see. We are at the base of an ice cliff."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Kirk,,Explain.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Spock,,"Just before you disappeared, Captain, I discovered a machine which Mister Atoz called the atavachron."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Kirk,,It must have been tied in to the tape viewer somehow.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Spock,,Opening time portals to the past. You cross through into the period which you were viewing.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Mccoy,,I was looking over some material about their Ice Age.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Spock,,"I am here, evidently, because I stepped through at the same instant as Doctor McCoy."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Kirk,,Yes. (a mob approaches) My friends are coming back with reinforcements.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Man,,There's the mort's accomplice. Arrest him.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Law,,"We are the law, and do require that you yield to us."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Kirk,,On what charge?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Law,,Thievery and purse cutting.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Kirk,,That's a mistake. I'm no thief.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Mccoy,,What's happening?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Law,,Lord help us. What's that?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Wench,,It's spirits.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Law,,"Away. Away, spirit, and let honest men approach."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Kirk,,Keep talking!
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Spock,,Captain!
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Man,,They speak at his bidding. Stop his mouth and they'll quiet.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Spock,,You must be close to the portal.

78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,,But he is overpowered and dragged away,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Mccoy,,"Jim, what's the matter? Jim sounded like he was in trouble."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Spock,,We may be in trouble ourselves. We must find shelter.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,,They walk on until McCoy collapses,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Spock,,"In this severe cold, we cannot survive much longer."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Mccoy,,"Leave me here, Spock."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Spock,,We go together or not at all.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Mccoy,,Don't be a fool. My hands and face are frostbitten. I can't feel my feet. Alone you have a chance. Now do what I say. Go try to find Jim.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Spock,,We go together.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Mccoy,,"You stubborn, thickheaded Vulcan!"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,,"A figure wearing a full length fur coat with hood approaches, then turns to walk away. Spock helps McCoy to follow",
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,,"It's quite homely, with the stalagmites and skins laid down, the lovely smooth floor and handy bed for Spock to put McCoy down on",
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"He's suffering from the severity of your weather. Unfortunately, he is the doctor, not I. I'll avoid giving him any medication at this time. Perhaps, if he's kept quiet and warm, he may recover naturally. It is agreeably warm here."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,,Their benefactor has pushed back the hood to reveal that it is a young woman,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,What are you called?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,I'm called Spock.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,Even your name is strange. Forgive me. I've never seen anyone who looks like you. Why are you here? Are you prisoners too?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,Prisoners?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,This is one of the places Zor Kahn sends people when he wants them to disappear. Didn't you come in through the time portal?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"Yes, we came through the time portal, but not as prisoners. We were sent here by mistake."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,"The atavachron is far away, but I think you come from someplace farther than that."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,That is true. I am not from the world you know at all. My home is a planet millions of light years away.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,"Oh, how wonderful! I've always loved books about such possibilities. But they are only stories. This isn't real. I must be imagining all this. I'm going mad!"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,Listen to me. I am firmly convinced that I do exist. I am substantial. You are not imagining this.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,"Oh, I've been here for so long, alone. When I saw you out there, I couldn't believe it. Is he dying?"

78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,An island.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,What is this island?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,It's called Earth.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,I know no island Earth. No matter. Continue.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,"I never saw that woman before tonight. When she screamed, as far as I could tell, she was being attacked."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,Then you deny being her accomplice?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,"Yes, I deny it. I was reading in the library when I heard her scream. My lord, the library? Do you remember where the library is, my lord?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,Perhaps your part in this is innocent. I believe you to be an honest man.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Wench,,He's a witch!
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,"Take care, woman. I am convinced of your guilt. Do not compound it with false accusation."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Wench,,He speaks to unseen spirits. He's a witch! You heard the voices!
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Law,,"It's truth, my lord. I heard the spirit talk to him. He answered and did call it Bones."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Wench,,You're a witch. He cast a spell. He made me steal against my wish.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,Surely you don't believe
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,You heard these spirits?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Law,,"Aye, my lord. I'll witness to it."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,"What he heard, my lord, were only my friends behind the wall in the library. In the library."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,I know nothing of this. Send for someone learned in witchcraft and let him examine him. I will have nothing to do with it.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,"My lord, at least arrange for me to meet Mister Atoz."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,I know of no Atoz.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,Yes! Yes! Atoz!
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,"I know nothing of this, nothing of these matters! I will not hear him!"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,Let me speak to you!
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,I will not hear him.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,,Judge and law man leave,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,At least let me talk to you!
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Wench,,Witch! Witch! Witch! They'll burn ya.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"McCoy. McCoy, wake up."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,Who are you?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,My name is Zarabeth.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"Zarabeth. Spock, are we in the library?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"No, we are still in the Ice Age, but safe for the moment."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,Jim. What about Jim?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"Doctor, you're in no condition to get up. You lie down and rest. I shall attempt to find the captain."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"You find him, Spock. Don't you worry about me. You just find him."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,,Spock and Zarabeth leave him to sleep,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,"Spock, who is this Jim?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,,She removes the fur coat to reveal she is wearing little more than a leather bikini with boots,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,He's our commanding officer and our friend.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,I saw only the two of you. I did not know there was another.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"He did not come with us. He was sent through the time portal to another period in history much later than this one. If I am to find him, there is only one possible avenue. Zarabeth, will you show me where the time portal is?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,But your friend. He is ill.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"Yes, that is true. If I leave him, there's a chance he may never regain the ship. He would then be marooned in this time period. But he is no longer in danger of death, so my primary duty to him has been discharged. If I remain here, no one of our party would be able to aid Captain Kirk."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,You make it sound like an equation.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"It should be an equation. I should be able to resolve this problem logically. Perhaps it has something to do with the atavachron. If only I knew more about how it worked. Zarabeth, you said that you were brought here as a prisoner. May I ask"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,Why? My crime was in choosing my kinsmen unwisely. Two of them were involved in a conspiracy to kill Zor Kahn.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,I remember that name from the history tapes in the library. Zor Kahn the Tyrant.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,It was not enough that he execute my kinsmen. Zor Kahn determined to destroy our entire family. He used the atavachron to send us places no one could ever find us.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"Zarabeth, I must return to Mister Atoz and the atavachron. We will carry Doctor McCoy, and you must come with us. I will send you and the doctor to the ship, and I shall search for Captain Kirk."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,"I can't go through the portal again. If I do, I will die."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,You cannot go back?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,"None of us can go back. When we come through the portal, we are changed by the atavachron. That is its function. Our basic cell structure is adjusted to the time we enter. You can't go back. If you go through the portal again, you will die by the time you reach the other side."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,standing,Spock? Where are we?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,"You are safe here, McCoy."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"Yes, I remember you."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"Come, Doctor, back to bed."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"Why are you still here, Spock? Why aren't you looking for Jim?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"It is impossible to look for him, Doctor. We cannot go back."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,What do you mean impossible? We've got to get back.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"Zarabeth explained it to me. When we came through the time portal, it altered our physiological structure. If we attempt to return to the library, we shall die."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,Are you trying to tell me that we're trapped here?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"Yes, Doctor, we are trapped. Just as Jim is trapped wherever he is."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate 5943.9. The people of this time believe in witches, and witchcraft is what I've been accused of. Five witnesses heard McCoy's voice speak to me and thought it was an evil spirit. From what I know of witchcraft trials, I don't have much chance unless I can get to the prosecutor."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Law,,"No supper for you, love. (lets the wench out of her cell) Come on. Up you go."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Jailor,,Give me your cup.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,,Kirk manages to grab his arm and pull him against the bars,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,Cry out and I'll break it. Don't move.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,,"He takes the keys and unlocks his own cell, lets himself out, knocks out the jailor and drags in inside, shutting the door behind him. The Judge comes down the steps",
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,Jailor! Jailor!
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,I'm being falsely accused. You know that.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,You will come with me before the inquisitional tribunal. There the matter of your witchcraft will be decided.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,There are no such things as witches!
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,"Jailor! That is sacrilege. If they hear you, they will burn you for such beliefs."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,"You're the only one that can hear me, and that's the truth. There are no witches. Why do you deny it?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,Do not let them hear you. There are witches! There are! You yourself may be discovered to be a witch by the inquisitor. No! What are you doing? No!
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,,Kirk drags him inside the cell,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,Help! Help!
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,"I'll denounce you to the inquisitor. You came here from the future just as I did. Therefore, you, too, are a witch."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,I beg you. Do not implicate me. They would burn me.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,Then help me.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,I will do everything I can to prove you innocent. I will disprove all the charges of witchcraft. But you must never again speak to the comrades you left behind.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,Help me return to the library. I've lost my way. I must get back there.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,You cannot get back.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,"I tell you I must! I had two friends with me, who are lost in another time period. I must find them. You'll come back with us."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,We can never go back. We must live out our lives here in the past. The atavachron has prepared our cell structure and our brain patterns to make life natural here. To return to the future would mean instant death.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Kirk,,Prepared? I was not prepared. Your Mister Atoz did not prepare me in any way.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17c jail,Judge,,"Then you must get back at once! If you were not transformed, you can only survive for a few hours here in the past. Come. Hurry. Hurry."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"Zarabeth, you are a beautiful cook. Have you ever been told that?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,Not recently.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"Oh, well, you'll find that Spock is quite delinquent in those matters."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,I hadn't noticed it.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"Oh? Well, now that I'm feeling better, you'll notice a distinct difference in our approach."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,Really?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,"It's something to look forward to. I think you must be well enough, Doctor, to try the few delicacies this climate has to offer."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"No, not yet."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,"At your rate of progress, it will be soon, I can see."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,Doctor McCoy is making excellent progress.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,And Mister Spock has been practicing medicine without a license. Don't let him doctor you. I'm the doctor around here.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,And known as the worst patient in the entire crew of the Enterprise.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,I wonder where she is.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,Five thousand years in the future.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,Thank you.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,,Zarabeth leaves them,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,I wonder where Jim is.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"Who knows. We can only hope that he is well, wherever he is."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"What do you mean, we can only hope? Haven't you done anything about it?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,What was there to do?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,Locate the portal. It can't be too far.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"We've been through all that, Doctor. What's the point of rehashing that subject? We can't get back. Wasn't that clear to you?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"Yes, that was clear to me."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,Then perhaps you were too ill to understand what can't get back means.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"I don't believe it, Spock. It's just not like you to give up trying."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"Then I'll repeat it for you. Get this through your head. We can't get back. That means we are trapped here in this planet's past just as we are, and we'll stay here for the rest of our lives. Now do you understand?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"Yes, I understand. I never thought I'd hear it, but I understand. You want to stay here. As a matter of fact, you're highly motivated to stay in this forsaken waste."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,The prospect appeared quite attractive to you a moment ago.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"You listen to me, you pointed-eared Vulcan."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"I don't like that. I don't think I ever did, and now I'm sure."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"What's happening to you, Spock?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,Nothing that shouldn't have happened long ago.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,Long ago. Of course. Long ago.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,,"Back in the street, at the wall Kirk came through",
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Judge,,This is where it is. I can't remember the exact spot.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,,Kirk feels along the wall until his hand disappears into it,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,Judge,,That's it! That is the portal. I cannot wait any longer.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,17th century,,"The judge hurries away, and Kirk slips through the wall back into the library",
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,Spock? McCoy? Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Scott,,"Scott here, Captain."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,How much time before the sun blows up?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Scott,,Seventeen minutes. You three had better come back right away.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,"We can't, Scotty. Spock and McCoy are missing."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Scott,,I knew there was trouble. I've got a landing party standing by.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,"No. Under no circumstances send anyone else here without my orders. Prepare to warp out and stand by. Kirk out. Mister Atoz, where are you?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,May I help you? It's you. You're lucky you found your way back here. Now let me process you through the atava
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,"No. Mister Atoz, my friends and I are from another planet. We don't belong in your history. We don't belong on your planet at all."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,Just let me take care of you and get you back where you belong.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,No. I want to find the exact disc that they were viewing.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"Please, go back!"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,"I'm sorry, Mister Atoz. Mister Atoz!"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,,They tussle,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,I must prepare to escape.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,,"Kirk pushes him into a side room and shuts the door, then turns to face another Atoz",
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,"I'll let you out in a minute. Still up to your little game of replicas? Which are you this time, real or not?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,,He knocks this one out,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"You are evidently a suicidal maniac. I don't understand what you're trying to do, but if you continue, both of us will die. and I for one, do not wish death."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,"If you help me, we won't die. I promise you that."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,I don't trust you.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,"Which one are you now, the replica or the real one?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,I am the real Atoz. You've done away with my replicas. I regret what I must now do.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,"You don't really want to hurt me, do you? You've been trying to save my life. I realise that. Put that thing away."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,,But Atoz fires the little tube at Kirk and he falls to the floor,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,"I cannot pretend to be sorry that you are here, though I realise it is a misfortune for you. I'm here against my will too, just as you are."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,I'm sorry. I know of no way to return you to your own time.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,It's not that I wish to return. This is my time now. I've had to face that. But it has been lonely here. Do you know what it's like to be alone? Really alone?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,Yes. I know what it is like.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,"I believe you do. Have something to eat, please."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,If it pleases you. This is animal flesh?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,"There's not much else to eat around here, I'm afraid."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"Naturally, because of the climate. What is the source of heat in the shelter?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,There's an underground hot spring.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"Excellent. Then it will be possible to build a greenhouse of sorts. Meanwhile, this will have to do as the only source of nourishment."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,,He takes a bite,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,There aren't many luxuries around here. Zor Kahn only left me what was necessary to survive.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,But he evidently intended that you continue living.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,"Yes. He gave me weapons, a shelter, food. Everything I needed to live except companionship. He did not want it said that he had me killed. But to send me here alone, if that is not death, what is? A very inventive mind, that man."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"But insensitive, to send such a beautiful woman into exile. The cold must've affected me more than I realised. Please pay no attention. I'm not myself. I'm behaving disgracefully. I have eaten animal flesh and I have enjoyed it. What is wrong with me? I tell you you're beautiful. But you are beautiful. Is it so wrong to tell you so?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,I have longed to hear you say it.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,,"They kiss, then he picks her up and smiles broadly",
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,You are beautiful. More beautiful than any dream of beauty I've ever known.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,,He lays her down and .... sets the scene for many fan-fictions,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,,"Kirk wakes up lying on a sled, which Atoz is pushing towards the portal",
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"Just stay where you are, sir. I'll see you get to safety."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,,"Kirk rolls off, so Atoz tries to push him through. He fails, and gets overpowered",
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,"Now, you're going to help me look for my friends."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,You're a most determined man.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,Kirk here.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Scott,,What's happening? Why are you waiting?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,No time to explain. Are you ready to warp out?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Scott,,"Aye, Captain."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,"Stand by to beam us up. But when that star explodes, don't wait. Get out fast. Kirk out. Now we're going to start looking. They were in a frozen waste. I could hear the wind."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"All right, all right. All right! It must be the Sarpeidon Ice Age, five thousand years ago. Let me look."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,"We'll both look, Mister Atoz."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"Spock. You've been dishonest with me, Spock, and that is also something new for you."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"I've given you the facts, Doctor."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,The facts as you know them. Or did you just accept Zarabeth's word because it's what you wanted to believe?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,"You were told the truth. If Zarabeth is the source, what difference does it make?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"Zarabeth is a woman condemned to a terrible life of loneliness. She would do anything to anybody to change that. Wouldn't you, Zarabeth?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,I told you what I know.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,Did you? You said we can't get back. The truth is you can't get back.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,She would not jeopardise other lives.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"She would do anything to prevent that life of loneliness. She would lie. She would cheat. She would even murder me, the captain, the entire crew of the Enterprise to keep you here with her. Go ahead, Zarabeth, tell Spock the truth. Go ahead. Tell Spock you would kill!"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,What are you doing to her?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,,Spock pins McCoy against the cave wall,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"Are you trying to kill me, Spock? Is that what you really want? Think. What are you feeling? Rage? Jealousy? Have you ever had those feelings before?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,This is impossible. Impossible. I am a Vulcan.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"The Vulcan you knew won't exist for another five thousand years. Think, man. What's happening on your planet right now, this very moment?"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,My ancestors are barbarians. Warlike barbarians.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"Who nearly killed themselves off with their own passions. Spock, you're reverting into your ancestors five thousand years before you were born!"
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Spock,,I've lost myself. I do not know who I am. Can we go back?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Zarabeth,,I don't know. I only know that I can't go back.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,Mccoy,,"I know I'm going to try, Spock, because my life is back there, and I want that life."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,cave,,"So McCoy heads off through the arctic winds, with just a fur shawl for protection",
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,Do you think that's the right one?
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,I don't know.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"If we're to get the portal set for the proper time period, you must be specific."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,I didn't see it.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,Well try calling out.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,Bones? Spock! McCoy! You've got the wrong one.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Atoz,,"Please, there's no time left. Let me go."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,library,Kirk,,Try again.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,,Zarabeth and Spock join McCoy at the ice cliff,
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Spock,,"There's no portal here, Doctor. It's hopeless."
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Mccoy,,I suppose you're right.
78,3,All Our Yesterdays,ice age,Spock,,You're too ill to remain out here any longer. Give it up.

The Enterprise has received a distress call from a group of scientists on Camus Two, who are exploring the ruins of a dead civilisation. Their situation is desperate. Two of the survivors are the expedition surgeon, Doctor Coleman, and the leader of the expedition, Doctor Janice Lester."

79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Mccoy,,What form of radiation was it?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Coleman,,Nothing I've ever encountered.

79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,,Janice grabs Kirk's arms. She makes a noise,

79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Janice,,I hoped I wouldn't see you again.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Kirk,,I don't blame you.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Janice,,The year we were together at Starfleet is the only time in my life I was alive.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Kirk,,I never stopped you from going on with your space work.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Janice,,Your world of starship captains doesn't admit women. It isn't fair.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Kirk,,"No, it isn't. And you punished and tortured me because of it."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Janice,,I loved you. We could've roamed among the stars.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Kirk,,We'd have killed each other.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Janice,,It might have been better.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,,"Kirk has a look around the room, and finds a wall-sized device with strange carvings. Janice sits up, points a remote at it and it lights up, pulling Kirk onto its surface. Janice gets out of bed, flips a switch on the device then stands in front of it too. She flips another switch then the machine works. We are shown images of Janice and Kirk going into the other's body.",
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,,Kirk steps down first and switches the machine off. He carries Janice back to the bed,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Kirk,,"You had your chance, Captain Kirk. You should've smothered the life in me. Then they would have said Doctor Janice Lester died of radiation poisoning in the line of duty. Why didn't you do it? You always wanted to. Didn't you? You had the strength to do it. But you were afraid. You were always afraid. Now Janice Lester takes the place of Captain Kirk. I already possess your physical strength. Only this Captain Kirk is not afraid to kill. Now you know the indignity of being a woman. For you this agony will soon pass, as it has for me. Quiet. Quiet! Believe me, it's better to be dead than to live alone in the body of a woman. It's better to be dead."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,,"He makes to strangle her with her own scarf, but is interrupted by the sound of footsteps",
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Kirk,,"Doctor McCoy, your report."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Mccoy,,"We were too late, Jim. There's nothing could be done."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Kirk,,Was it radiation as suggested?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Mccoy,,"No, I believe it was celebium. However, Doctor Coleman disagrees. To be specific is essential because the treatment of celebium is quite"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Coleman,,Doctor McCoy.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,,He goes over to Janice,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Mccoy,,Did you notice any unusual symptoms while we were gone?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Kirk,,"No, nothing at all. She was unconscious all of the time."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Coleman,,Doctor Lester is near death.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Kirk,,Perhaps the shock of knowing what happened to her staff is part of her problem.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Coleman,,I'm sure it is.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Mccoy,,Beaming her up to the Enterprise will be less harmful than waiting.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Coleman,,I don't know. I'm not sure.

79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Scott,,"Mister Scott, sir."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,camus ii,Kirk,,"Mister Scott. Prepare to beam the landing party aboard plus two others. One critically ill. Have a medical team standing by to receive the patient. Captain Kirk, out. Prepare to beam aboard."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,transporter room,,Kirk is carrying Janice in his arms. He puts her on a gurney,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,transporter room,Kirk,,"Doctor Coleman, accompany the patient to the Sickbay. Mister Spock, take the ship out of orbit. Resume designated course. Doctor McCoy. Doctor McCoy, you and Doctor Coleman seem to disagree on diagnosis."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,transporter room,Mccoy,,"No, not entirely. We both agree it's radiation. Doctor Coleman isn't prepared to say what form of radiation."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,transporter room,Kirk,,Will it affect your arriving at a correct treatment?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,transporter room,Mccoy,,It's crucial.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,transporter room,Kirk,,"Well, this is especially disturbing to me for personal reasons."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,transporter room,Mccoy,,Oh? I didn't know you knew her that well.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,transporter room,Kirk,,"Oh, yes. It's been a long time since I saw her. I walked out on her when it became serious."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,transporter room,Mccoy,,"Well, you must have been very young at the time, Jim."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,transporter room,Kirk,,"Youth doesn't excuse everything, Doctor McCoy. It's a very unhappy memory for me."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,transporter room,Mccoy,,I didn't realise that. I shall do everything in my power.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,transporter room,Kirk,,Thank you. Thank you very much.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,transporter room,,McCoy leaves,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,transporter room,Scott,,Doctor Lester is certainly a very lucky young person to have escaped.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,transporter room,Kirk,,"Yes, very lucky. Very lucky."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,,Janice is delirious. Coleman is with her. Kirk enters,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,It just began.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Kirk,,Well you'd better put a stop to it! If you allow Doctor Lester to become fully conscious she'll know what has happened.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,Probably no one will believe it.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Kirk,,Probably?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,That's all we can ask for. How can death be explained now?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Kirk,,I tell you it can't continue.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,You killed every one of the staff. You sent them where you knew the celebium shielding was weak. Now why didn't you kill him? You had the perfect opportunity.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Kirk,,There wasn't enough time.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,I gave you every minute you asked for.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Kirk,,He hung onto life too hard. I couldn't
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,You couldn't because you love him. You want me to be his murderer.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Kirk,,Love? Him? I love the life he led. The power of a starship commander. It's my life now.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,I won't become a murderer.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Kirk,,You are a murderer! You knew it was celebium. You could've treated them for it. You're a murderer many times over.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,,McCoy and a now brunette Chapel enter,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Jim, what are you doing here?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Kirk,,I thought my presence might quiet Doctor Lester. It seems to have had the opposite effect.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,It has nothing to do with you. It's a symptom of the developing radiation illness.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Tests with the ship's equipment shows no signs of internal radiation damage, Doctor Coleman."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Kirk,,Didn't Doctor Lester's staff become delirious before they went off and died?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,"Yes, Captain. Yes."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Doctor Lester could be suffering from a phaser stun as far as the symptoms I can detect, Jim."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Kirk,,"Doctor Coleman, Doctor McCoy has had a great deal of experience with radiation exposure on board the Enterprise. I am guided by his opinion."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,"Doctor Lester and her staff have been under my supervision for two years. If you don't follow my recommendations, responsibility for her health or her death will be yours."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Kirk,,"Doctor McCoy, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to take you off the case and turn it over to Doctor Coleman."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Mccoy,,You can't do this! On this ship my medical authority is final!
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Kirk,,Doctor Coleman wants to assume the full responsibility. Let him do it.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Mccoy,,I won't allow it.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Kirk,,"It's done! Doctor Coleman, your patient. Doctor Coleman, didn't you suggest a sedation to rest the patient?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,"Yes, Captain."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Mccoy,,"It's not necessary, Jim. Can't you see she's coming around?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,,"Janice opens her eyes, sees Kirk and has flashbacks to the transferal, just to remind us who is really who",
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Kirk,,Doctor Coleman.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,"Nurse, administer the sedative."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Mccoy,,"A sedative is not wise at this time, Captain."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,"Nurse Chapel, you have your orders."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Mccoy,,"Nurse Chapel, follow your instructions."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,,Chapel injects Janice,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Janice,,"Oh no. Am I really losing command of the Enterprise? No. Oh, no. Bad dream. Bad dream."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Kirk,,"James Kirk is returning to consciousness in the body of Janice Lester. The Enterprise is proceeding to its next mission, on the course set before I took over command. Now the years I spent studying every single detail of the ship's operation will be tested. With a little experience, I will be invulnerable to suspicion. At last I attain what is my just due. Command of a starship. All the months of preparation now come to fruition."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Kirk,,"Course, Mister Chekov."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Chekov,,One two seven mark eight.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Sulu, set speed at warp factor two."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Sulu,,"Warp factor two, sir."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Chekov, plot a course for the Benecia Colony."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Chekov,,"Direct course to Benecia, three seven three mark eight."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Kirk,,How long to the colony at our present speed?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Chekov,,"Forty-eight hours, sir."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Sulu, set course for the colony. Three seven three mark eight."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, sir. Three seven three mark eight."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Spock,,"Captain, that will delay our work at Beta Aurigae. It means reversing course."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Kirk,,"Yes, it can't be helped. We must take Doctor Lester to a place where she can be treated."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Spock,,May I point out that Starbase Two is on the direct route to our destination.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Kirk,,How long to Starbase Two?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Chekov,,"Seventy two hours, Captain."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Kirk,,It's twenty four hours too long. Doctor Lester's condition is increasingly serious. Continue present course.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Sulu,,"Aye, sir."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Spock,,"If the diagnosis of Doctor Lester's illness is the critical problem, then the Benecia Colony is definitely not the place for her. Their medical facilities are the most primitive."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Kirk,,They will have to serve.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Spock,,Starbase Two is fully equipped and staffed with the necessary specialists to determine exactly what is wrong with the doctor. Is that not crucial to your decision?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Kirk,,"Thank you, Mister Spock, but the facilities will be of little use if Doctor Lester's dead. Time is of the essence. Continue present course."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Spock,,"At maximum speed, Starbase Two would still meet the emergency."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Lysa,,"Captain, shall I advise Starfleet Command of the change of plan?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Kirk,,"No change of plan has been ordered, Lieutenant. Our arrival at Beta Aurigae will merely be delayed. Our gravitational studies of that binary system will not suffer, and a life may be saved! That is not unusual procedure for the Enterprise."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Spock,,"Sir, I believe Starfleet will have to be notified that our rendezvous with the starship Potemkin will not take place as scheduled."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, if you'd concentrate on the areas for which you are responsible, Starfleet Command would've been informed already."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Spock,,"Since the captain usually deals directly with Starfleet in these matters, I assumed that my suggestions might be deemed interference."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Kirk,,"Inform Starfleet of the delay, Lieutenant."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Lysa,,"Aye, sir."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Kirk,,Continue present course. Increase speed to warp factor six.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,,"Kirk is sitting at his desk, filing his nails",
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,I'll let my record speak for me.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Why are you being so defensive? There's no implied criticism of you in my order to remove you from the case.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,That is not the reason I'm here. I'm here because Doctor Coleman's record states that he's incompetent.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,That's the opinion of an individual.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"No, sir. That is the opinion of Starfleet Command. I checked with them. Doctor Coleman was removed from his post as Chief Medical Officer of his ship for administrative incompetence."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,There are no administrative duties required here.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,As well as flagrant medical blunders.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,"Promotions and demotions can be politically manoeuvred. You know that, Bones."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"Not in Starfleet Headquarters, Captain. And certainly not in the Surgeon General's office."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,I'm afraid the order will have to stand. I can only say that Doctor Coleman's experience with what happened on the planet had to be the deciding factor here. I'm sure that you can appreciate that.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"I appreciate the fact that you had a decision to make. I also find myself in that position now, Jim, and I'm asking you to report for an examination."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,What? What do you base that on?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,Development of emotional instability and erratic mental attitudes since returning from that planet.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,You'll never make that charge stick. Any fool can see why you're doing this.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,I'll let Starfleet Command be the judge of my motives.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,I won't submit to this petty search for revenge!
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,Mccoy,,"But you will submit to Starfleet regulations, and they state that the ship surgeon will require full examination of any crew member that he has doubts about, including the captain."

79,3,Turnabout Intruder,kirk's quarters,Kirk,,Captain Kirk here.

79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,Quiet would be best for you.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Janice,,Where's Doctor McCoy?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,I'm in charge now.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Janice,,Bring Doctor McCoy at once! He is in command of medicine on this ship.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,He was taken off your case by Captain Kirk.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Janice,,By Captain Kirk?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,"It was done for your own protection, Doctor Lester."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Janice,,"I am not Janice Lester! She did this to me! Now how can I make you understand? Janice has driven herself mad with jealousy, hatred and ambition."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,,Chapel enters,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Janice,,"Nurse Chapel. Bring Mister Spock and Doctor McCoy to me at once. Now they must believe I am not Janice Lester. I am imprisoned in her body, but I am not Janice Lester."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,She is suffering from the delusion of being Captain Kirk.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Janice,,I am not Janice Lester!
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,The paranoia has been developing for the past six months. The radiation seems to have intensified it. She must be kept sedated.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Chapel,,"Shall prepare a mild sedative, Doctor?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,Of course.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,,Chapel leaves,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,,Janice sees her reflection in a mirror,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Coleman,,"You are insane, Doctor Lester."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Narrator,,"Captain's log, stardate unknown. I have lost track of time. I am still held captive in a strange body and separated from all my crew."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,,Janice wakes. There is a single restraining strap across the bed,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Janice,,I must've sounded quite mad to you before.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Chapel,,What you've been through would've completely broken most of us.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Janice,,"Well, I'll be all right now. Could I see your Doctor McCoy?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Chapel,,I'm afraid that's against Doctor Coleman's orders.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Janice,,Oh. Is a visit by that very kind Mister Spock to be allowed?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Chapel,,Perhaps that can be arranged before we reach the Benecia Colony.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Janice,,The Benecia Colony? But isn't the Enterprise going to rendezvous with the Potemkin at Beta Aurigae?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Chapel,,"Well, first we have to let you recuperate at Benecia. (offering a drink) You'll feel better if you have a little."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Janice,,"Well, I'll try. Thank you. Oh, it is good. Thank you. Could I finish it slowly, Nurse Chapel?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Chapel,,Well
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Janice,,I promise I'll be good.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,Chapel,,"Well, I'll be right back. I'm glad you're feeling so much better."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay,,"Chapel leaves, Janice pours the drink on the floor and breaks the glass against the bed. Then she uses it to cut the strap holding her down",
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay - exam ward,Mccoy,,These tests should help me pinpoint the cause of Jim's illness.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay - exam ward,Spock,,Good. Knowledge of the captain's aberrant behaviour is spreading through the ship. The crew is becoming increasingly tense.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay - exam ward,Mccoy,,"Yes, well what worries me most is that Jim seems completely unaware that something is wrong with him. We've got to make him realise that something serious is happening before treatment can even begin."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay - exam ward,Spock,,"I'm afraid that is a forlorn hope, Doctor. The illness appears to be primarily mental."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay - exam ward,Mccoy,,"One of us should be able to get to him. I keep looking for an approach, but the speed at which the illness has traveled makes it doubly difficult."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay - exam ward,Spock,,Perhaps the Surgeon General's office should be alerted.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay - exam ward,Mccoy,,"You know headquarters, Spock. They're only interested in results of specific tests. So far all we have to offer are our opinions."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay - exam ward,Spock,,Are you sure that the captain will comply with your order in his present state of mind?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay - exam ward,Mccoy,,I'll use my medical authority to enforce it if necessary.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay - exam ward,Spock,,"Doctor, we are treading on very thin ground. Actions such as these might be misinterpreted."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay - exam ward,Mccoy,,"Well, then, so be it. Our responsibility is clear."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay - exam ward,Spock,,Whatever happened to the captain on that planet must've taken place in the short space of time that he was alone with Doctor Lester. Perhaps a conversation with her might shed some light.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay - exam ward,Mccoy,,"Well, it's worth a try. Why don't you try to get to Doctor Lester while I examine Jim."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay - exam ward,,Kirk enters,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay - exam ward,Kirk,,"Well, gentlemen. I'm here, Doctor."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay - exam ward,,Janice has run down the corridor and now enters,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay - exam ward,Janice,,Spock. Bones. Help me. Don't let them lock me away from you. I've got to talk to you.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,sickbay - exam ward,,She backs out into the corridor and Kirk follows her,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,,Kirk knocks her out,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,Mccoy,,Jim!
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,Kirk,,She might have killed someone.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,,Two security guards arrive,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,Kirk,,"Put her in isolation in her room. Maintain a twenty four hour watch. No one, absolutely no one, is to talk to her without my permission!"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,Galloway,,"Yes, sir."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,,Spock leaves,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,Mccoy,,Captain.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,,McCoy and Kirk re-enter the exam room,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,outside lester's room,Spock,,How is the doctor?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,outside lester's room,Galloway,,She regained consciousness very quickly.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,outside lester's room,Spock,,Good. I have questions to ask her.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,outside lester's room,Galloway,,"Did the captain order it, sir?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,outside lester's room,Spock,,"Why should he? They are my questions, therefore I am ordering it, Lieutenant."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,outside lester's room,Galloway,,The captain said no one is allowed to speak to Doctor Lester.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,outside lester's room,Spock,,Has such an order ever included his senior officers?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,outside lester's room,Galloway,,"No, sir. Mister Spock, I think the captain meant that a guard should be present."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,outside lester's room,Spock,,"By all means, Lieutenant."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,exam room,,"Shirt off, Kirk is doing the heart rate exercise",
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,exam room,Mccoy,,"That's enough. That's enough. Your heart will last forever, Captain."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,exam room,Kirk,,How am I otherwise?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,exam room,Mccoy,,"In the pink, as usual. Liver, kidney, blood count, metabolic rate. Everything, even your glands, functioning at their usual, normal peak of efficiency."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,exam room,Kirk,,Good. I hope you're as pleased about it as I am.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,exam room,Mccoy,,Don't get dressed yet.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,exam room,Kirk,,You said I was in perfect condition.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,exam room,Mccoy,,Physically.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,exam room,Kirk,,I don't think another test is necessary.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,exam room,Mccoy,,"The Robbiani dermal-optic is crucial. It reveals the basic emotional structure. You had one once before. Now I need another one to compare with that previous test. There should be no change in your dermal-optic reactions to the colour wavelengths. Over here, Captain. Over here, Captain."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,Spock,,Complete life-entity transfer with the aid of a mechanical device?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,Janice,,"Yes, that's what it must've been."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,Spock,,"To my knowledge, such total transfer has never been accomplished with complete success anywhere in the galaxy."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,Janice,,It was accomplished and forgotten long ago on Camus Two. I am a living example.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,Spock,,"That is your claim. As yet, it is unsubstantiated by any external evidence or objective tests."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,Janice,,"Nevertheless, Spock, it is the truth I'm speaking."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,exam room,Narrator,,Kirk is being bathed in coloured light with his eyes closed)
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,exam room,Mccoy,,Now lower your arms and open your eyes.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,Spock,,"At this moment Doctor McCoy is examining the captain for psychological changes. If any facts are uncovered, that would be acceptable evidence. The only kind which is acceptable to Starfleet Command and to the crew of the Enterprise."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,Janice,,"Spock, when I was caught in the interspace of the  Tholian Sector, you risked your life and the Enterprise to get me back. Help me get back now. When the Vians of Minara demanded that we let Bones die, we didn't permit it."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,Spock,,"That is true. The captain did not. However, those events have been recorded. They could have become known to you."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,Janice,,You are closer to the captain than anyone in the universe. You know his thoughts. What does your telepathic mind tell you now?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,,"Under the watchful gaze of the guard, Spock does a quick mind-link",
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,Spock,,"I believe you. However, my belief is not acceptable evidence. Evidence must be factual. Doctor McCoy may be of help. Come with me."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,Galloway,,"I'm sorry, sir, but Doctor Lester cannot leave here."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,mccoy's office,Kirk,,"Well, are you satisfied with the results of the tests?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,There is no positive evidence of any disorder.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,Galloway,,You're asking me to violate the captain's orders.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,Spock,,He is not the captain.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,Galloway,,You're as mad as she is. You're to leave here at once. I follow orders.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,Spock,,"Certainly, Lieutenant. We all must do our duty."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,,Spock walks past him and feints a neck pinch. It is parried so he gets him with the other hand,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,janice's room,Galloway,,Security guard!
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,mccoy's office,,Shaking hands,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,mccoy's office,Kirk,,"No hard feelings, Bones. You did your usual thorough, good job."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,mccoy's office,Mccoy,,I'm sure everything's going to be all right.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,mccoy's office,Ensign,,Captain Kirk!

79,3,Turnabout Intruder,mccoy's office,Ensign,,Escape attempt by Doctor Lester.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,mccoy's office,Kirk,,Captain Kirk to Security. On the double to Doctor Lester's room!
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,outside janice's room,Spock,,"It's quite all right, Ensign. Everything is under control."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,outside janice's room,,Neck-pinches him as McCoy and Kirk arrive. Then two more security come out of the turbolift,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,outside janice's room,Kirk,,Phasers.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,outside janice's room,Spock,,"A repetition of your physical violence is not called for, sir. No physical resistance will be offered."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,outside janice's room,Kirk,,"Attention, all personnel. First Officer Spock has been placed under arrest. He has conspired with Doctor Lester to take over the ship from your captain. A hearing will be immediately convened to consider the charges and specifications of a general court martial on the charge of mutiny."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,outside janice's room,Narrator,,"Captain's Log, stardate 5930.3. The results of Doctor McCoy's examination have given me complete confidence in myself. My fears are past. I shall function freely as the captain. I am the captain of the Enterprise, in fact."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,,"Scott is questioning Spock, but the log entry obliterates some of the evidence",
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Scott,,Surely you must have more than that to go on.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Spock,,I have stated my evidence. Telepathic communication with the mind of Captain James T. Kirk.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Scott,,Your evidence is completely subjective. We have to have evidence that we can examine out in the open.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Spock,,"You've had great deal of evidence, except that of the chief witness. The one who should be the real subject of this investigation is kept locked away and in isolation. Why, Captain?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,She's dangerously insane. We've seen the evidence.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Spock,,"She is dangerous only to your authority, sir."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,"Mister Spock. Mister Spock, my authority has been given to me by Starfleet Command, and only that high authority can take it away."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Spock,,"The witness, sir. Bring on the witness. Let your officers put the questions."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,"Mister Lemli, have Doctor Janice Lester brought here."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Lemli,,"Aye, sir."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,,The security man leaves,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,"Doctor McCoy, while Mister Spock was busy with his ambitious plot, what were you doing?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Mccoy,,Examining you.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,"Oh, yes. You were deeply concerned about my health, emotional and physical, since leaving Camus Two. Is that correct?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Mccoy,,"Yes, that's correct."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,"Instead of trying to destroy me, you were searching for ways to help me. Doctor McCoy, for the record, will you tell the court your findings?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Mccoy,,The captain is in the best of physical condition. His emotional and mental state is comparable to the time that he assumed command of the Enterprise.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,"Thank you, Doctor McCoy. Mister Spock, were you aware of Doctor McCoy's findings?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Spock,,I know them now.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,And what have you to say now?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Spock,,I am disappointed and deeply concerned that there is no objective evidence to support my position. So far.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,,Lemli enters with Janice and Coleman,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,"Doctor Coleman, if you're required here, we'll call you."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,,Coleman leaves. Janice takes the witness stand,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,"We certainly appreciate your being here. Everyone is deeply aware that you have been subjected to inordinate emotional stress. We had hoped to avoid any further stress, but Mister Spock disagrees. It is his opinion that your testimony is important in determining the merits of his case. And since we are solely interested in arriving at a just decision, I'm going to have to ask you a few more questions. I'll try not to upset you. You claim that, that you are Captain James T. Kirk?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Janice,,No. I am not Captain Kirk. That is very apparent. I claim that whatever it is that makes James Kirk a living being special to himself is being held here in this body.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,"Oh. Well. However, as I understand it, I am Doctor Janice Lester."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Janice,,"That's very clever, but I didn't say it. I said, the body of James Kirk is being used by Doctor Janice Lester."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,A subtlety that somehow escapes me. I assume that this switch was arrived at by mutual agreement.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Janice,,No. It was brought about by a violent attack by Doctor Lester and the use of equipment she discovered on Camus Two.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,"Violence by the lady, perpetrated on Captain Kirk? I ask the assembled personnel to look at Doctor Janice Lester and visualise that historic moment. Can you, can you tell me why Doctor Janice Lester would agree to this ludicrous exchange?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Janice,,"Yes. To get the power she craved, to attain a position she doesn't merit by temperament or training. And most of all, she wanted to murder James Kirk, a man who once loved her. But her intense hatred of her own womanhood made life with her impossible."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,Are you prepared with witnesses? One will do.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Spock,,"Sir, there is only one issue here. Is the story of life-entity transfer believable? This crew has been to many places in the galaxy. They've been witness to many strange events. They are trained to know that what seems to be impossible often is possible, given the scientific analysis of the phenomenon."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,"Mister Spock, have you ever heard of a case such as described by Doctor Janice Lester?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Spock,,"Not precisely, no."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,"Oh. Assuming that you are correct in your belief, do you expect Starfleet Command to place this er, this er, person in command of the Enterprise?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Spock,,I expect only to reveal the truth.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,"And with the truth revealed, that I am not really the captain, and knowing that she would not be allowed to serve as the captain, then you would be the captain! It is inevitable! Spock. Spock, give it up! Return to the Enterprise family. All charges will be dropped and the madness that temporarily overcame all of us on Camus Two will fade and be forgotten."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Spock,,And what will become of Doctor Lester?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,Doctor Lester will be cared for always. It is a debt and a responsibility I owe her from the past.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Spock,,"No, sir. I shall not withdraw a single charge that I have made. You are not Captain Kirk. You have ruthlessly appropriated his body, but the life entity within you is not that of Captain Kirk. You do not belong in charge of the Enterprise and I shall do everything in my power against you."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,"Lieutenant Lysa, play back those last two sentences from Mister Spock's tirade."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Spock,,You do not belong in charge of the Enterprise and I shall do everything in my power against you.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,You heard the statements placed into the record by you. Do you understand the nature of it?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Spock,,I do. And I stand by it.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,thumping the table,"It is mutiny! Deliberate, vindictive, insane at its base! But mutiny is charged, and encouragement to mutiny. Doctor McCoy, Mister Scott, you heard it! On the basis of these statements, I call for an immediate vote, by the powers granted to me as captain of the Enterprise. A recess is declared, to be followed by a vote."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Spock,,"Yes, sir. An immediate vote before our chief witness can be left to die on some obscure planet with the truth locked away inside of her."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,"Silence. You will be silent! A recess has been declared. There will be no cross-discussion. When I return, we will vote on the charge of mutiny. The evidence presented here is the only basis of your decision."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,Mccoy,,Scotty.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,Scott,,"Doctor. Doctor, I've seen the captain feverish, sick, drunk, delirious, terrified, overjoyed, boiling mad. But up to now I have never seen him red-faced with hysteria. I know how I'm going to vote."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,Mccoy,,I've been through this with Spock. He's not being scientific and neither are you.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,Scott,,"It may not be scientific, but if Mister Spock thinks it happened, then it must be logical."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,Mccoy,,Don't you think I know that? My tests show there's nothing wrong with the captain. Now that's the only fact Starfleet's going to be interested in.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,Scott,,"Headquarters has its problems, and we have ours. And right now, the captain of the Enterprise is our problem. They're going to call for the vote in a few minutes. Let me put one last question. Suppose you vote with me, in favour of Spock. That means two votes to one and Spock is free. What do you think the captain'll do?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,Mccoy,,I don't know.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,Scott,,"Aye, you know, all right. It'll stick in his craw. He'll never accept it."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,Mccoy,,We don't know that.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,Scott,,"I tell you, he won't. Then, Doctor, that's the time we move against him. We'll have to take over the ship."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,Mccoy,,"We're talking about mutiny, Scotty."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,Scott,,Aye. Are you ready for the vote?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,corridor,Mccoy,,Yes. I'm ready for the vote.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,Play the tapes of the conversation in the corridor.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Lysa,,"Aye, sir."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Scott,,Then's the time we move against him. We'll have to take over the ship.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Mccoy,,"We're talking about mutiny, Scotty."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Scott,,Aye. Are you ready for the vote?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Mccoy,,That's enough. We know what was said.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,"Enough to convict you of conspiracy with mutineers. And you're so charged. The sentence, death. Mister Lemli."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Chekov,,Starfleet expressly forbids the death penalty.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,All my senior officers turning against me?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Sulu,,The death penalty is forbidden. There's only one exception.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Chekov,,General Order Four. It has not been violated by any officer on the Enterprise.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,I am responsible. The execution will be immediate. Go to your posts. Go to your posts.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,,Chekov and Sulu leave,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,Kirk,,"Mister Lemli, take them to the brig. Prepare for execution. Go on!"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,courtroom,,"Scott and McCoy are escorted out at phaser point. Janice follows and Spock follow, also under armed guard",
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Sulu,,The captain really must be going mad if he thinks he can get away with an execution.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Chekov,,Captain Kirk wouldn't order an execution even if he were going mad. That cannot be the captain.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Sulu,,What difference does it make who he is? Are we going to allow an execution to take place?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Chekov,,"If security backs him up, how will we fight him?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Sulu,,I'll fight them every way and any way I can.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,,Kirk enters,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Kirk,,"Lieutenant Lysa, inform all sectors of my decision. Have each section send a representative to the place of execution on the hangar deck. Mister Chekov, how far to the Benecia Colony?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Chekov,,Coming within scanning range.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Kirk,,"Plot co-ordinates for orbit. Mister Sulu, lock into co-ordinates as soon as orbit is accomplished. Interment will take place on Benecia."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,,Chekov and Sulu remove their hands from their controls,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,Kirk,,"You have received your orders! You will obey my orders. You'll be charged with mutiny! You will obey my orders or, or,"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,bridge,,"He starts convulsing, and Janice is doing the same in the brig",
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,Janice,,"For a moment, I thought that I was up on the bridge."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,Spock,,Perhaps you were.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,Mccoy,,Then it's possible the transference can be broken.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,Janice,,"Well, if it happens again, I'll fight to stay there."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,Scott,,The bridge is where you belong.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,Spock,,"To accomplish that, each one of us must be ready to seize any opportunity to break out of here and attack."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,medical lab,Kirk,,"Arthur, the transference is weakening."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,medical lab,Coleman,,What happened?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,medical lab,Kirk,,"For a moment, I found myself back with the prisoners. I will not go back to being Janice Lester. You must help me prevent it."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,medical lab,Coleman,,The only way to prevent the transference is by the death of Janice Lester. You must carry out the execution.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,medical lab,Kirk,,I can't. I can't. The crew is in mutiny. You must kill her for me.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,medical lab,Coleman,,I have done everything else for you. But I will not murder for you.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,medical lab,Kirk,,"Then do it for yourself. If Kirk doesn't die, we'll both be exposed as murderers. Does that give you any choice?"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,medical lab,,Coleman gets a phaser and a hypo-spray,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,medical lab,Kirk,,The dosage should be doubly lethal.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,medical lab,Coleman,,It is.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,,which strangely looks straight out into the corridor,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,Kirk,,"To prevent further conspiracy, you will be removed to separate cells. If there's any resistance, you'll be given a sedative until you learn co-operation. Doctor Lester will be first. Follow Doctor Coleman."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,,Janice steps out into the corridor,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,Spock,,"May I point out, Captain"
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,,Janice struggles with Coleman,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,Kirk,,Kill him! Kill him!
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,,Then Kirk goes into another convulsion. The rest of the prisoners stroll into the corridor as the transfer undoes itself,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,Janice,,"Ohh! I've lost to the captain. I've lost to James Kirk! I want you dead! I want you dead! I want you dead! Oh, I'm never going to be the captain. Never. Kill him."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,,She goes to Coleman's arms to weep,
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,Coleman,,"You are, you are as I loved you."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,Janice,,Kill him.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,Kirk,,Can you do anything for her?
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,Coleman,,I'd like to take care of her.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,Mccoy,,Of course. Come with me.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,Kirk,,I didn't want to destroy her.
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,Spock,,"I'm sure we all understand that, Captain."
79,3,Turnabout Intruder,brig,Kirk,,"Her life could have been as rich as any woman's, if only. If only."
